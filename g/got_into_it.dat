5|$|The Pirates {{had been}} the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, {{finishing}} last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner, Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in World War I for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard's baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the Gowanus Canal, and not a single submarine <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ship {{only had}} two {{lifeboats}} remaining. Captain Reed {{and two of}} the crew, lowered the small boat at the stern and <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> in order to prepare rafts and save as many people as possible. Sixteen able-bodied men lowered the second and larger boat and rowed away, until they reached Isle au Haut.|$|E
25|$|On February 24, 1991 at WCW’s 1991 WrestleWar PPV Doom took on former tag-team champions The Fabulous Freebirds {{and lost}} due to {{miscommunication}} between Reed and Simmons. After the Freebirds left the ring Reed turned on Simmons {{and beat him}} up, turning Simmons face and supposedly ended the team of Doom forever. A month later, however, Reed and Simmons teamed up one more time at Starrcade '91 at Tokyo Dome, losing to the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Big Van Vader. After the match, Reed and Simmons <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> causing NJPW and WCW stars to separate them, indicating Doom was no more.|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|When Ambrosius {{first met}} Jackson, {{it took a}} few minutes to calm down. She {{recalled}} to the same publication Stewart was interviewed by, [...] "To begin with, I was kinda shook. Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

500|$|Recurring {{guest star}} Mike O'Malley {{appears in the}} episode as Kurt's father Burt, sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has {{described}} as the most emotional scene of the series thus far, explaining: [...] "Reading it on paper I {{had no idea it}} was going to be that intense. Once I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> then I kind of realised, 'Oh, there's such a bigger meaning behind this. Oh my God, this is so dramatic'." [...] Colfer called [...] "Theatricality" [...] his favorite episode of the whole series. Other recurring characters who appear in [...] "Theatricality" [...] are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton, who gets his first lines in this episode), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio, Principal Figgins, Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn's mother Carole Hudson.|$|E
500|$|Webcomic creator Randall Munroe {{described}} {{his reasons for}} creating [...] "Time" [...] {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, where he stated that he {{came up with the idea}} as he was pondering the space between animation and a daily comic, wanting to do something [...] "in between". In an interview with Computer Sweden, Munroe stated that he had never seen anyone attempt such a project before and that he [...] "wanted to see if it would work." [...] Munroe noted that, in some cases, [...] "things become more interesting if they are difficult to access," [...] such as in books that deliberately make the story more complicated. He hoped that, as people slowly <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> the world and language would excite readers on a deeper level. According to Munroe, nothing like [...] "Time" [...] had been done before because it is difficult to reach people once every hour without a tool such as the Internet.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. I had an idea and he really got it and <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal". Robyn spoke of the duo, saying that [...] "these really young guys who are part of a scene that I probably would've gotten into if I wasn't away so much when I was younger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maud Wood Park, who {{had been}} away in Europe for two years, {{received}} a letter that year {{from one of her}} co-workers in the College Equal Suffrage League who described the new atmosphere by saying, [...] "the movement which when we <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> had about as much energy as a dying kitten, is now a big, virile, threatening thing" [...] and is [...] "actually fashionable now".|$|E
2500|$|After the scandal, actress Brigitte Nielsen {{came forward}} and stated that she too {{had an affair with}} Schwarzenegger while he was in a {{relationship}} with Shriver, saying, [...] "Maybe I wouldn't have <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is dead serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on." [...] When asked in 2014 [...] "Of all the things you are famous for … which are you least proud of?", Schwarzenegger replied [...] "I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up".|$|E
2500|$|No, we're {{all done}} with that [...] now, all the old material. We didn't {{actually}} {{want to do the}} Greatest Hits, we were ready to start our new record—until the record company pointed out that it was in the contract. But then we <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and tried to be creative with it as much as [...] And, you know, we ended up being really proud of it. You have to have a different brain when you're doing a record like that. It's more about [...] "this is your achievement"; I could hold in one hand all the records we've released, so that was cool. We're moving on now, and getting on with the new record.|$|E

2500|$|Wake Up! {{follows the}} {{releases}} of Legend's Evolver (2008) and The Roots's How I Got Over (2010). Legend and The Roots were inspired {{to record a}} collaborative album by the 2008 United States presidential election. In an interview for Billboard, Legend explained {{the reason for the}} album's conception at the time, stating [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} campaigning for Barack Obama and feeling inspired by the atmosphere in the country at the time, so I wanted to do something musically that reflected that moment. The original idea was to do some sort of covers EP, but the more I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with the Roots, it felt like something that should be heard and marketed on its own". The album's title was inspired by Canadian rock band Arcade Fire's song of the same name.|$|E
2500|$|Another factor {{influencing}} the band's style was {{the concept of}} [...] "All", invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion during a late-night fishing trip on Stevenson's boat, the Orca. According to Aukerman: [...] "While drinking all this coffee {{in the midst of}} catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All — doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> the more it turned into their own religion; it's partly humor, but it's also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All". Stevenson described the concept of [...] "All" [...] as [...] "the total extent", and recalled that [...] "the quest for All became the main catalyst of the band, and we adopted this omni-ambitious way of life, for better and for better". He and McCuistion quickly wrote several very short songs that would later be recorded by the Descendents: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

60|$|I think I {{never saw}} {{anything}} more ridiculous--I was sensible of it, {{even at the}} time--than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler, and crying, 'Come on!' while Traddles and I pushed him back into a corner, from which, as often as we <b>got</b> him <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> he persisted in emerging again.|$|R

6000|$|... "Giles {{must have}} ridden on," [...] {{suggested}} Stephen, while Kit, growling angrily, {{called on the}} lazy fellow, Will Wherry, to wake and show himself.
