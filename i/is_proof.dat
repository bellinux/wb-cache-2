5|$|In June 1988, the {{archaeologist}} {{and leader}} of the Christian Conservative Party of the BPF Zyanon Paznyak discovered mass graves of victims executed in 1937–41 at Kurapaty, near Minsk. Some nationalists contend that this discovery <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.|$|E
5|$|The Lebanese {{identity}} card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (bițāqat al-hawiya); French: Carte nationale d'identité) is a compulsory Identity document issued to {{citizens of the}} Republic of Lebanon by the police {{on behalf of the}} Lebanese Ministry of Interior or in Lebanese embassies/consulates (abroad) free of charge. It <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of identity, citizenship and residence of the Lebanese citizens.|$|E
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E
50|$|Napoleonic French cuirasses were {{originally}} intended to <b>be</b> <b>proof</b> against three musket shots at close range; however, this was never achieved in practice. The regulations eventually recognised this, and cuirasses were subsequently only expected to <b>be</b> <b>proof</b> against one shot at long range.|$|R

5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in Washington, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examine {{video footage}} from a {{security}} camera positioned at the Mexican border. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands {{the task force}} searching for Doggett, believing the video <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted. Meanwhile, Doggett phones a U.S. Marine Corps public affairs office, hoping his Marine tattoo will {{shed some light on}} his true identity. Before he is able to ask any questions, he notices policemen nearby and flees.|$|E
5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E

5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Teena Mulder (Rebecca Toolan) and The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) visit Mulder, who is paralyzed in a hospital. After {{administering}} a {{drug that}} cures his paralysis, The Smoking Man reveals himself to be Mulder's father and takes him from the hospital. Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial black oil with which he was infected three years previously; because he is infected with the virus, Mulder <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of alien life. Skinner, who has been looking for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed {{him out of the}} hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to an unfamiliar neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin). Deep Throat claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the Syndicate, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same. Mulder meets Fowley, and the two become intimate.|$|E

25|$|The {{symbol of}} the town– the anchor, present on all coins minted by Apollonia since the sixth century BC, <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of the {{importance}} of its maritime trade. The rich town soon became an important cultural centre. At these times it was called Apollonia Magna.|$|E

DNA evidence subsequently confirmed his presence at the surgery in question.|$|E
25|$|Post-birth {{experiences}} are also believed to convey magical power, an example {{being that the}} survival of a near-death illness may be taken as evidence of their power as a healer. For example, in Bali, a medium's survival <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of her association with a patron deity and therefore her {{ability to communicate with}} other gods and spirits.|$|E

It is unusual, Your Majesty, to apprehend a gentleman so that he may show cause why he did not deserve such apprehension.

25|$|In All My Sons, these {{elements}} are all present; {{it takes place}} within a 24-hour period, has a protagonist suffering from a previous offense, and the punishment for that offense. Additionally, it explores the father-son relationship, also a common theme in Greek tragedies. Ann Deever could also be seen to parallel a messenger as her letter <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of Larry's death.|$|E
25|$|In many styles, such as soleá or siguiriya, {{the melody}} tends to proceed in {{contiguous}} degrees of the scale. Skips {{of a third}} or a fourth are rarer. However, in fandangos and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially {{at the beginning of}} each line of verse. According to Rossy, this <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian jota.|$|E
25|$|That <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> {{positive}} that disarmament was only useful {{insofar as it}} contained through the maintenance of sanctions and facilitated regime change. It was never about disarmament, it was never about getting rid {{of weapons of mass}} destruction. It started with George Herbert Walker Bush, and it was a policy continued through eight years of the Clinton presidency, and then brought us to this current disastrous course of action under the current Bush Administration.|$|E

The statement is thrown in as if it were not only true, but <b>was</b> <b>proof</b> that Turner <b>was</b> not uneasy. Turner's movements <b>are</b> <b>proof</b> of nothing. Nothing but a statement from Turner's mouth would have any value here, and he made none.|$|R
25|$|There was no {{immigration}} restriction into Hong Kong until 1950. People {{were free}} to travel across the Hong Kong-Chinese border. With {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China in 1949, the Hong Kong government decided to close the border and implement immigration control in an attempt to stem waves of immigrants and refugees. The government also began to register Hong Kong residents to issue compulsory identity cards. The Hong Kong ID card <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of legal residency still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius {{does not help}} {{to solve the problem}} since we have two Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (be born) this <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is {{similarly}} generated (or from *ǵen- know) than we have a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.|$|E
25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, <b>is</b> <b>proof</b> of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
