5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E

25|$|Doc Maynard's {{character}} and approach to city-building differed {{from that of}} his contemporaries William Bell, Arthur Denny, David Denny, Henry Yesler, and Carson Boren. In part, {{this may have been}} because he was much older and had already participated in the development of one city. He drank liquor (while the Denny Party were mostly teetotalers) and, with his friend Captain Felker, <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> to start a good brothel in Seattle — the infamous Mother Damnable — believing that vice was essential to the economic success of a frontier town of that time.|$|E
25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E

500|$|Burt {{could be}} tough, {{and not just}} with his children. Burt had {{originally}} devised millions in his will to the city, but retracted it when Saginaw officials increased his South Jefferson property assessment from $400,000 to $1 million four years before he died in 1919. One well known story recounts how Burt ordered some horses at the lumber mill to be starved and worked to death, [...] "Mr. Callam, the horses are too fat", Burt reportedly said. [...] "Trim them down, sir, and when the logs are out, dispose of them." [...] Mr. Callam refused to starve and kill the horses so Burt fired him, and <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> who would carry it out.|$|E

Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would [...] "... kick him out of her life ..." [...] if she learned his secret— that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents— was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them. Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Rare" [...] is an electropop {{and folk}} pop {{influenced}} ballad, that has [...] "an acoustic guitar and galloping beat". Lyrically, [...] "Rare" [...] discusses finding {{love in the}} [...] "perfect" [...] man, presumably Shelton.

[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly declared the song a [...] "sweetly smitten confessional". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the lyrics as [...] "her shock to have <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> {{this late in the}} game", while Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt that the lyrics observe [...] "that 'only a stupid girl' would let the 'perfect' man go." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé tells her ex-lover that, {{as he did}} not attempt to make things more {{permanent}} when he had the chance, he has no reason to complain now that she has <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> else. On the bridge, she affirms that she wants her new love interest [...] "to make like a prince and grab her, delivering her to 'a destiny, to infinity and beyond" [...] while [...] "Prince Charming is left standing there like the second lead in a romantic comedy". Towards the end of the song, Beyoncé takes a more aggressive vocal approach and employs a middle eight as she sings, [...] "And like a ghost I'll be gone". When she chants the chorus for the third and final time, her vocals are omnipresent within layers of music, as described by Frannie Kelley of NPR. An electronic swoop tugs in continuously until the song ends.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} eight chapters, 12 Days centers on Jackie Yuen, a 29-year-old part Cantonese and part Korean editor. After {{the death of her}} former lover, the Korean American school nurse Noah Yoon, she decides to drink her ashes over twelve days in {{beverages}} as a way of coping with her grief. Nicholas [...] "Nick" [...] Yoon, Noah's younger half brother, steals some of Noah's ashes for her to use, and soon joins her in mourning.

As Jackie continues her ritual, she begins to feel ill and eventually faints. Nick takes her to the hospital, where she recovers. On New Year's Day, she parts from Nick and returns to her apartment to find that he has taken the engagement ring she had wanted to give Noah, and unknown to her, he mixes it in with the remaining ashes. 12 Days concludes with [...] "Chapter 0", set before the events {{in the rest of the}} comic: Noah finds Nick studying for exams, and they briefly discuss Artemisia II of Caria, an ancient Greek queen who drank the ashes of her husband. Noah then hints that she has <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> whose ashes she would drink.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] is {{credited}} as a ballad {{compared to the}} rest of the dance-fuelled tracks from The Fame. It is a 1980s-influenced synthpop and bubblegum pop song, while incorporating the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] hook from Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella", according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post. Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations that with the lyrics, Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships. Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had <b>found</b> <b>someone</b> new and did not mean to hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing else I can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm. Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga's 2010 album, The Remix, where he manipulated Gaga's vocals and created a dreamy quality with them, as noted by Nicki Escuedo from Phoenix New Times.|$|E
