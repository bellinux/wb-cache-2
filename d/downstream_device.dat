40|$|Cross-flow {{filtration}} is {{has found}} considerable application in solid/liquid separation but is little-used in filtration of gases. In this filtration mode, {{a component of}} the particle-laden flow passes through the filter, depositing particles on the surface, while another component remains parallel to the surface, causing shear on the deposited cake. Solid/gas separation is usually carried out in the "dead-end" filtration mode, where the aerosol arrives at the filter on trajectories that are approximately perpendicular to it. Earlier studies [V. Sibanda, R. W. Greenwood, J. P. K. Seville, Powder Technology 118 (2001) 193 - 202] demonstrated that cross-flow filtration can be applied to gas filtration and that under certain operating conditions, particle aggregation can occur on the surface and the aggregates can subsequently be removed by the through-flow and collected in a <b>downstream</b> <b>device.</b> Particle size distribution measurements of the filter cakes formed at different cross-flow conditions also suggest that significant segregation of particles occurs in this filtration mode. Finer particles were observed to report to the filter cake at low cross-flow ratios and larger ones at higher cross-flow ratios. In this paper, measurements of the particle size distribution of filter cakes formed under a variety of cross-flow conditions were carried out and a mathematical model to describe the segregation was developed. The model is found to predict the segregation behaviour observed from the experimental measurements reasonably accurately. Segregation enhances the overall particle capture efficiency of the <b>downstream</b> <b>device</b> leading to a purer gas product and makes cross-flow gas filtration an attractive option.

The data packets follow a directed graph set up by TORA.

Scaling of the discrete independent variable related with the stages was crucial for the computational implementation of the proposed method, avoiding accumulation of round-off errors present even in low-degree polynomial approximations in the original discrete variable.

A purpose developed magnetic bead based technology to serially extract both DNA and RNA from tissues was automated on a Tecan Freedom Evo robotic workstation. Results: 864 fresh-frozen human normal and tumor tissue samples from breast and colon were serially extracted in batches of 96 samples. Yields and quality of DNA and RNA were determined. The DNA was evaluated in several downstream analyses, and the stability of RNA was determined after 9 months of storage. The extracted DNA performed consistently well in processes including PCR-based STR analysis, HaloPlex selection and deep sequencing on an Illumina platform, and gene copy number analysis using microarrays. The RNA has performed well in RT-PCR analyses and maintains integrity upon storage.
