It has aim to obtain the high-precision of DSLIM for the linear slow speed applications. One of limiting factor for precision linear movement is cogging force. The efforts in reducing the cogging action in rotary induction motor has been conducted very well. However, the cogging force reduction in the DSLIM with ladder secondary has not been done before. The DSLIM provide a great advantages for LIM-driven wheel vehicles for specific applications, for example vehicles {{that are used in}} over short distances, e. g. at planned stop, switches, or slopes or linear feed axes of machine tools. The disadvantage for very low applications is the existence of cogging forces that can cause the precision-decreasing of the linear movement. The design for reducing cogging force refers to storage magnetic energy variation in the air gap. At first, effects of ratio slot pitch between in the moving and stationary parts over the storage magnetic energy have been investigated and produced a new structure results of DSLIM. Secondly the winding structures variation in slots of moving part which it can make cogging force between tooth cancel each other.

40|$|High {{precision}} linear machining tools is one {{of interesting}} research field in related to high qualitative products which is also becoming one of competitive factor. The movement precision can be affected by existence of ripple force, unpredicted external load and frictional force. The existence of cogging force is the one limited factor of the linear precision.

Many researchers have conducted the reduction of cogging torque of its machining tools drive supported by using a feedback control algorithm variation concepts. Because of the great opportunity of construction variation in linear motors, this paper proposes to investigate an innovation of the cage secondary Double sided linear induction motor construction aimed to obtain the zero cogging Force. The cogging force can be predicted by investigated of the variation of stored energy magnetic in the air gap. Therefore, at first in this paper the implementation of estimation flux path in multi-tooth model in which is built as similar construction to the cage single sided linear induction motor, and will be verified by building experimental multi-tooth test-bed. Based on that multi-tooth experiment and the justification of estimation flux path method, the <b>double-sided</b> <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> with offset position between both sided will be developed with the assumption that the cogging force will be able to cancel each other.
