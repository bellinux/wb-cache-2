Given played <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the club's league matches for a third successive season, as well as all 13 European games.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her gardens, {{and before}} her flag-draped coffin {{was taken from}} Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches {{of the armed forces}} stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

25|$|Both the Chennai Super Kings and the Mumbai Indians {{were a part}} of the {{original}} eight teams of the Indian Premier League when its first season was held in 2008. From the first season, Chennai had been a formidable, well-balanced team with a strong lineup of Indian players, including the captain of India Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

They immediately became runners-up in 2008 and had continued to appear in every knockout/playoff stage since. They were the most successful IPL team, being twice champions and twice runners-up in the IPL and also the winners of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20.
