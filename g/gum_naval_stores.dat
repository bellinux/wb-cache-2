50|$|Because of a {{shortage}} of workers willing to perform the heavy manual labor involved in the streaking of many acres of trees and in collecting the resin tree by tree as well, the <b>gum</b> <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> industry entered a period of steep decline beginning in the 1960s. As of 2001, only one large-scale facility (begun as Filtered Rosin Products) in Baxley, Georgia, continued in operation, serving the remaining naval stores producers in the surrounding area. Gradually, the method of tapping trees to obtain naval stores products has become overshadowed by industries which yield these products as byproducts of other operations.|$|E
50|$|With {{the passing}} of wooden ships, those uses of pine resin ended, but the {{industry}} remained vigorous as new products created new markets. First extensively described by Frederick Law Olmsted in his book A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (1856), the naval stores industry {{was one of the}} economic mainstays of the southeastern United States until the late 20th century. Despite a rapid decline of the <b>gum</b> <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> industry {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century, a few places in the southeastern United States still rely on it as a major part of their livelihood.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gum</b> <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> {{cultivation}} {{refers to}} the labor-intensive method of extracting pine resin from the trees (the raw gum). The method of collection—tapping the trees—vaguely resembles that used on a rubber plantation or in a maple sugar grove. However, instead of preparing the tree to receive a pipe or tap, the tree is gashed with an inch-wide curved blade, called a “hack,” to remove all of the bark down through the cambium layer. An angled piece of galvanized tin is then placed below the eight-inch-long, one-inch-wide gash (also known as “the streak”) to direct the oozing sap into a quart-sized rectangular cup fixed to the tree. Each new “streak” is put onto the tree above the preceding one, and gradually a vertical “cat face” more than thirty inches in height is formed. Through the mid-twentieth century, a [...] "puller," [...] a type of hack that had a long handle, was used to extend the streak up the tree to a height of more than seven feet.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{industrial}} decline is important from both historical and policy perspectives. The United States {{was the world}} s leading producer of <b>gum</b> <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> {{in the early twentieth}} century, but by the late 1970 s production had all but ceased. Evidence presented here indicates that changing relative prices induced forest owners, the key stakeholders, to shift production towards other forest products. Nevertheless, the federal government continued to provide transfers to this industry even as political support for it vanished. The demise of this once-great American industry lends support to the received notion that once instituted, transfer programs tend to persist. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Naval</b> <b>stores</b> {{played a}} role during the American Revolutionary War. As Britain {{attempted}} to cripple French and Spanish capacities through blockade, they declared <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> to be contraband. At the time Russia was Europe's chief producer of <b>naval</b> <b>stores,</b> leading to the seizure of 'neutral' Russian vessels. In 1780 Catherine the Great announced that her navy would be used against anyone interfering with neutral trade, and she gathered together European neutrals in the League of Armed Neutrality. These actions were beneficial for the struggling colonists as the British were forced to act with greater caution.|$|R
