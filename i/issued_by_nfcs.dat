40|$|In {{two studies}} we {{assessed}} the moderating role of two individual difference variables (Self-Reported Habit Index, SRHI; Need For Cognition, NFC) {{on the relationship}} between implicit (Implicit Association Test, IAT; Extrinsic Affective Simon Test, EAST) or explicit measures of attitudes and measures of behavior. A clear dissociation pattern was apparent in both studies on a self-report diary measure of behavior. For study 1, the relationship between EAST and behavior was moderated by SRHI, while the relationship between explicit measures of attitude and behavior was moderated <b>by</b> <b>NFC.</b> For study 2, the relationship between IAT and behavior was moderated by SRHI, while the relationship between explicit measures of attitude and behavior was moderated <b>by</b> <b>NFC.</b> Higher levels of SRHI and NFC were associated respectively, with stronger relationships between the implicit or explicit measures of attitude and the measure of behavior. In Study 2 the SRHI by IAT interaction was replicated for an objective measure of behavior. Implications for understanding the relationship between implicit and explicit measures of attitudes and measures of behavior are discussed...|$|R

The GSMA standards surrounding the deployment of <b>NFC</b> protocols (governed <b>by</b> <b>NFC</b> Forum) on mobile handsets are neither exclusive nor universally accepted. For example, Google's deployment of Host Card Emulation on Android KitKat provides for software control of a universal radio.

30|$|The second mode, {{the peer}} to peer mode, is the sharing data between 2 or more <b>NFC</b> devices <b>by</b> <b>NFC</b> {{transmission}} technique limited {{within the range of}} 10 cm. If the size of the sent data is larger, of course, the transfer speed becomes low. In such cases, the data communication is realized by the high speed communication method such as Bluetooth or WiFi after the authentication of each NFC devices or tags. The mechanism is called ‘handover’. The sent data is certificated by the protocol of the second communication method.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This work {{presents}} an initial analysis of phenomena {{that influence the}} acceptance of Near-Field Communication technology (NFC) from an emotional point of view. The objective is to experiment the analysis of emotions as a design method to outline useful insights for designer. Even if the NFC technology is ready to grant safe users experience for payment and access to places, it is facing difficulties reaching user’s acceptability. The paper will compare emotions and cognitive processes characterizing actual analogue experiences to digital ones supported <b>by</b> <b>NFC.</b> As a result a framework of design guidelines for engaging NFC services will be provided.

Participants who scored either low or {{high on the}} NFC scale performed an ambiguous categorization task with either low or high difficulty.

If difficulty was high, participants with high NFC showed increased PEP reactivity compared to participants with low NFC. These results extend previous research on Wright's model of engagement-related cardiovascular reactivity and suggest that the model may provide a useful framework for assessing the impact of personality on cardiovascular response...|$|R
