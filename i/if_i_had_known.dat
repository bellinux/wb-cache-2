For example, the Wisconsin State Journal described it as [...] "hands down the worst series finale ever". The episode featured a holodeck simulation on the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) from [...] during {{the events of the}} episode [...] "" [...] and the return of Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You have to remember that under normal circumstances most people probably would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it".

500|$|Even after {{achieving}} the record, Hershiser expressed regret: [...] "Because {{of respect for}} Don {{and respect for the}} record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him {{to get out there and}} go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>known</b> that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>known</b> {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E

She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

However, Tchaikovsky himself preferred Sylvia to his own work, calling his own masterpiece [...] "poor stuff in comparison".

Brumby was swamped by letters and telegrams, all of which he answered conscientiously, although some were so abusive that King advised him to ignore them. Months later, King still refused {{to shake hands with}} a particular reporter; told of King's snub, Brumby exclaimed, [...] "Why, King, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>known</b> it was that son-of-a-bitch, I would not have shaken hands with him either." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beckett {{refrained from}} elaborating on the {{characters}} beyond {{what he had}} written in the play. He once recalled that when Sir Ralph Richardson [...] "wanted the low-down on Pozzo, his home address and curriculum vitae, and seemed to make the forthcoming of this and similar information the condition of his condescending to illustrate the part of Vladimir ...

I'm convinced and sure that this war was planned and that the capture of these hostages was just their excuse to start their pre-planned war, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>known</b> on July 11 ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it?

She found her part [...] "challenging" [...] to play, remarking: [...] "It was a watershed experience.

We have all these assignments about how we're supposed to feel about something."
