5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>input,</b> but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>input,</b> but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>input</b> from the inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>input.</b> Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new fiber-based {{polarization}} diversity detection (PDD) scheme for polarization sensitive {{optical coherence tomography}} (PSOCT). This implementation uses a new custom miniaturized polarization-maintaining fiber coupler with single mode (SM) <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> and polarization maintaining (PM) fiber outputs. The SM <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> obviate matching the optical lengths of the two orthogonal OCT polarization channels prior to interference while the PM fiber outputs ensure defined orthogonal axes after interference. Advantages of this detection scheme over those with bulk optics PDD include lower cost, easier miniaturization, and more relaxed alignment and handling issues. We incorporate this PDD scheme into a galvanometer-scanned OCT system to demonstrate system calibration and PSOCT imaging of an achromatic quarter-wave plate, fingernail in vivo, and chicken breast, salmon, cow leg, and basa fish muscle samples ex vivo...|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships. Several theoretical models {{have been developed to}} explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by David Marr and James Albus, based on the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the parallel fibers of the granule cells; the other is an extremely strong input from a single climbing fiber. The basic concept of the Marr–Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a [...] "teaching signal", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs.</b> Observations of long-term depression in parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial.|$|R
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} cerebellum plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>input</b> would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
500|$|Climbing fibers fire at low rates, but {{a single}} {{climbing}} fiber action potential induces a burst of several action potentials in a target Purkinje cell (a complex spike). The contrast between parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (over 100,000 of one type versus exactly {{one of the other}} type) is perhaps the most provocative feature of cerebellar anatomy, and has motivated much of the theorizing. In fact, the function of climbing fibers is the most controversial topic concerning the cerebellum. There are two schools of thought, one following Marr and Albus in holding that climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>input</b> serves primarily as a teaching signal, the other holding that its function is to shape cerebellar output directly. Both views have been defended in great length in numerous publications. In the words of one review, [...] "In trying to synthesize the various hypotheses on the function of the climbing fibers, one has the sense of looking at a drawing by Escher. Each point of view seems to account for a certain collection of findings, but when one attempts to put the different views together, a coherent picture of what the climbing fibers are doing does not appear. For the majority of researchers, the climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance, either in the usual manner of discharge frequency modulation or as a single announcement of an 'unexpected event'. For other investigators, the message lies in the degree of ensemble synchrony and rhythmicity among a population of climbing fibers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{may take}} place at the central level after peripheral nerve damage. The loss of afferent signals induces functional changes in dorsal horn neurons. A decrease in the large <b>fiber</b> <b>input</b> decreases the activity of interneurons inhibiting nociceptive neurons i.e. loss of afferent inhibition. Hypoactivity of the descending antinociceptive systems or loss of descending inhibition may be another factor. With the loss of neuronal input (deafferentation) the STT neurons begin to fire spontaneously, a phenomenon designated [...] "deafferentation hypersensitivity." ...|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|R

40|$|Purkinje {{cells can}} encode the {{strength}} of parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> in their firing by using 2 fundamentally different mechanisms, either as pauses or as linear increases in firing rate. It is not clear which of these 2 encoding mechanisms {{is used by the}} cerebellum. We used the pattern-recognition capacity of Purkinje cells based on the Marr–Albus–Ito theory of cerebellar learning to evaluate the suitability of the linear algorithm for cerebellar information processing. Here, we demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of pattern recognition in Purkinje cells linearly encoding {{the strength of}} parallel <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> in their firing rate. In contrast to encoding patterns with pauses, Purkinje cells using the linear algorithm could recognize a large number of both synchronous and asynchronous input patterns in {{the presence or absence of}} inhibitory synaptic transmission. Under all conditions, the number of patterns recognized by Purkinje cells using the linear algorithm was greater than that achieved by encoding information in pauses. Linear encoding of information also allows neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei to use a simple averaging mechanism to significantly increase the computational capacity of the cerebellum. We propose that the virtues of the linear encoding mechanism make it well suited for cerebellar computation...|$|R

50|$|David Marr {{suggested}} that the granule cells encode combinations of mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs.</b> In order for the granule cell to respond, it needs to receive active inputs from multiple mossy fibers. The combination of multiple inputs results in the cerebellum {{being able to make}} more precise distinctions between input patterns than a single mossy fiber would allow. The cerebellar granule cells also play a role in orchestrating the tonic conductances which control sleep in conjunction with the ambient levels of GABA which are found in the brain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Neural {{networks}} are introduced {{which can be}} taught by classical or instrumental conditioning to fire {{in response to a}}rbitrary learned classes of patterns. The filters of output cells are biased by presetting cells whose activation prepares the output cell to "expect " prescribed patterns. For example, an animal that learns to expect food in response to a lever press becomes frustrated if food does not follow the lever press. It's expectations are thereby modified, since frustration is negatively reinforcing. A neural analog with aspects of cerebellar circuitry is noted, including diffuse mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> feeding parallel <b>fibers</b> that end in Purkinjecell dendrites, climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> ending in Purkinje cell dendrites and giving off collaterals to nuclear cells, and inhibitory Purkinje cell outputs to nuclear cells. The {{networks are}} motivated by studying mechanisms of pattern discrimination that require no learning. The latter often use two successive layers of inhibition, analogous to horizontal and amacrine cell layers in vertebrate retinas [...] Cells exhibiting hue (in) constancy, brightness (in) constancy, or movement detection properties are included. These results are relevant to Land's retinex theory and to the existence of opponent- and nonopponent-type cell responses in retinal cells. Some adaptation mechanisms, and arousal mechanisms for (~rispening the pattern weights that can fire a given cell, are noted. 1...|$|R

40|$|Eyelid {{conditioning}} {{has proven}} useful {{for analysis of}} learning and computation in the cerebellum. Two variants, delay and trace conditioning, differ only by the relative timing of the training stimuli. Despite the subtlety of this difference, trace eyelid conditioning is prevented by lesions of the cerebellum, hippocampus, or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas delay eyelid conditioning is prevented by cerebellar lesions and is largely unaffected by forebrain lesions. Here we test whether these lesion results {{can be explained by}} two assertions: (1) Cerebellar learning requires temporal overlap between the mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> activated by the tone conditioned stimulus (CS) and the climbing <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> activated by the reinforcing unconditioned stimulus (US), and therefore (2) trace conditioning requires activity that outlasts the presentation of the CS in a subset of mossy fibers separate from those activated directly by the CS. By use of electrical stimulation of mossy fibers as a CS, we show that cerebellar learning during trace eyelid conditioning requires an input that persists during the stimulus-free trace interval. By use of reversible inactivation experiments, we provide evidence that this input arises from the mPFC and arrives at the cerebellum via a previously unidentified site in the pontine nuclei. In light of previous PFC recordings in various species, we suggest that trace eyelid conditioning involves an interaction between the persistent activity of delay cells in mPFC-a putative mechanism of working memory-and motor learning in the cerebellum...|$|R

The most proximal regions of CA3 pyramidal dendrites receive mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>input</b> exclusively, mid-dendritic regions (strata radiatum on the apical side and the oriens on the basal side) receive principally associational and Commissural fibers (from other CA3 cells), and the distal apical dendrites (stratum lacunosum-moleculare) receive input from the temproammonic afferents (from the entorhinal cortex).

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{plays an}} important role in the coordination and refinement of movements and cognitive processes. Recently, it has been shown that the main output neuron of the cerebellar cortex, i. e., the Purkinje cell, can show a different firing behavior dependent on its intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Yet, to what extent a different nature of mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> can influence the firing behavior of cerebellar cortical neurons remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared the firing rate and regularity of mossy fibers and neurons in two different regions of cerebellar cortex. One region intimately connected with the cerebral cortex, i. e., lobules VI/VII of the neocerebellum, and another one strongly connected with the vestibular apparatus, i. e., lobule X of the archaeocerebellum. Given their connections, we hypothesized that activity in neurons in lobules VI/VII and lobule X may be expected to be more phasic and tonic, respectively. Using whole-cell and cell-attached recordings in vivo in anesthetized mice, we show that the mossy <b>fiber</b> <b>inputs</b> to these functionally distinct areas of the cerebellum differ in that the irregularity and bursty character of their firing is significantly greater in lobules VI/VII than in lobule X. Importantly, this difference in mossy fiber regularity is propagated through the granule cells at the input stage to the Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons, ultimately resulting in different regularity of simple spikes. These data show that the firing behavior of cerebellar cortical neurons does not only reflect particular intrinsic properties but also an interesting interplay with the innate activity at the input stage...|$|R
