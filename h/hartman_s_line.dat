Material and Method: In this study, standing anteroposterior lumbar radiographs of 519 patients aged 16 and younger were analyzed retrospectively.

Heritabilities for dry matter and soluble solids were 52. 6 % and 36. 1 % respectively. Both traits were highly correlated.

5000|$|While fairly {{similar to}} UTA's TRAX light rail the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> {{operates}} at a substantially slower speed, {{with a top}} speed of 25 mph. The <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> also differs from TRAX in that, for the most part, it only has a single track (with passing tracks) and it operates with more frequent stops for easy pedestrian access. Other differences are that the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> operates with a single car, rather than a [...] "train" [...] of cars. Because of its slower speed, some S-line at-grade road crossings do not have barrier arms that stop vehicular traffic. Instead many streetcar crossings have traffic lights, while several are controlled by stop signs. Accordingly, the streetcars may be required to slow down or even stop prior to crossing roadways. (These road crossing also include crosswalks that parallel the tracks, and pedestrian traffic lights as well.) The fare for the <b>S</b> <b>Line</b> is the same as for TRAX and the same methods of payment (including the FAREPAY card) are accepted.|$|R
