40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to find an appropriate analytical method for scheduling the daily driver tasks in the grocery industry. The goal is to maximize driver utilization. A "Bin-packing" approach is employed to solve the problem. A Bin-packing problem concerns packing a list of items into the minimal number of unit capacity bins. In our problem, the drivers correspond to the bins and the daily delivery tasks are equivalent to the items, where we use time units to measure bin capacity. The model is applied to characterize the operation of a grocery company. Several bin-packing algorithms are implemented on two weeks of delivery data, which represent the company's transportation demand. The <b>driver</b> <b>requirements</b> are calculated and compared with their actual assets. <b>Driver</b> <b>requirements</b> are assessed on a per-day basis, considering the volatility in transportation demand {{over the course of}} the week. The performance of a given bin-packing algorithm is measured by how well it maximizes driver utilization and balances the workload among the drivers. The model's solution generated labor savings and proved that better resource allocation is possible by considering the demands of the various dispatching locations and the days of the week. Extension of the current model to capture the time window constraints of the delivery locations is proposed for future further research. by Arzum Akkas. Thesis (M.

Each vehicle is considered to be contracted with the vehicle aggregator who is responsible for the provision of power for the cold load pickup compensa-tion. The aggregator controls the electric vehicles by broadcasting a prob-ability signal in order to trigger their response. In the proposed strategy, the vehicles are placed in groups and each group defines whether the vehicle is available to feed power into the grid, based on its technical constraints and the <b>driver</b> <b>requirements.</b> Finally, it is assumed that the aggregator ca...|$|E

30|$|Taxi {{services}} were unregulated {{when they first}} began over a century ago; regulation {{was brought in to}} protect road users from the safety impacts of poor driving and the sometimes violent conduct of drivers vying for business [38]. But the regulation, which initially took the form of limiting the number of drivers, developed {{in a variety of ways}} over time and location. According to Bekken [4], writing before the advent of Uber and its ilk, there are three categories: direct barriers to entry (principally quantitative and qualitative regulations on the operators); indirect barriers to entry (of which <b>driver</b> <b>requirements</b> and vehicle requirements are obvious examples); and fare regulations. This is close to the four-fold structure adopted by International Transport Forum Corporate Partnership Board [27] in its deliberations: public safety rules (including insurance); market entry conditions; service requirements; and fares. In this context, Darbéra [11] offers a useful clarification based on the distinction between the French words régulation and réglementation: regulation is the business of ensuring that a given market “works” in some agreed sense by imposing a set of economic controls. Deregulation, the removal of some or all of those controls, will not tend to mean the disappearance of all rules and laws (réglementation), and will probably instead imply a range of new ones to promote competition.|$|E

The common upper interface is compatible with all of the target operating systems and presents a consistent Applications Programming Interface (API) for the telemetry application developer. The lower interface is specific for each platform but contains minimal device specific functionality. A simple register I/O driver is easily implemented using all of the target operating systems.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{magnetic}} field within a fusion target {{is now known as}} Magnetized Target Fusion in the US and as MAGO (Magnitnoye Obzhatiye, or magnetic compression) in Russia. In contrast to direct, hydrodynamic compression of initially ambient-temperature fuel (e. g., ICF), MTF involves two steps: (a) formation of a warm, magnetized, wall-confined plasma of intermediate density within a fusion target prior to implosion; (b) subsequent quasi-adiabatic compression and heating of the plasma by imploding the confining wall, or pusher. In many ways, MTF can be considered a marriage between the more mature MFE and ICF approaches, and this marriage potentially eliminates some of the hurdles encountered in the other approaches. When compared to ICF, MTF requires lower implosion velocity, lower initial density, significantly lower radial convergence, and larger targets, all of which lead to substantially reduced driver intensity, power, and symmetry requirements. When compared to MFE, MTF does not require a vacuum separating the plasma from the wall, and, in fact, complete magnetic confinement, even if possible, may not be desirable. The higher density of MTF and much shorter confinement times should make magnetized plasma formation a much less difficult step than in MFE. The substantially lower <b>driver</b> <b>requirements</b> and implosion velocity of MTF make z-pinch magnetically driven liners, magnetically imploded by existing modern pulsed power electrical current sources, a leading candidate for the target pusher of an MTF system...|$|E

Over the past twenty years, over $ 2 billion has been allocated for the improvement of railroad-highway grade crossings. Many passive crossings have been upgraded with active protection which has decreased the number of collisions at grade crossings each year; however, collisions at grade crossings are still a major concern. In order to continue improving safety at grade crossings, driver comprehension and driver attitudes must be investigated. This research investigated driver comprehension and driver attitudes concerning railroad-highway grade crossings through the use of literature review and driver survey. The goal of the survey was to test motorists understanding of the traffic control devices at grade crossings. A total of 1010 surveys were collected in Houston, Laredo, and Nacogdoches, Texas. The results showed that drivers, especially young drivers, expressed a lack of understanding of <b>driver</b> <b>requirements</b> and traffic control devices at both active and passive crossings. Drivers also showed a poor attitude toward active devices, 12 percent of the drivers said it was "okay" to drive around the gates if no train was present. Ninety six percent of the drivers remembered something about safe driving at railroad-highway grade crossings from a driver's education course or public safety campaign. It was recommended that more emphasis should be placed on safe driving at railroad crossings in both drivers education and defensive driving classes {{based on the results of}} the driver survey...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} a novel method for fabricating quantum dot light-emitting devices (QDLEDs) based on colloidal inorganic light-emitting nanoparticles incorporated into an organic semiconductor matrix. CdSe core/ZnS shell nanoparticles were inkjet-printed in air and sandwiched between organic hole and electron transport layers to produce efficient photon-emissive media. The light-emitting devices fabricated here were tested as individual devices and {{integrated into a}} display setting, thus endorsing the capability of this method as a manufacturing approach for full-colour high-definition displays. By choosing inkjet printing as a deposition method for quantum dots, several problems currently inevitable with alternative methods are addressed. First, inkjet printing promises simple patterning due to its drop-on-demand concept, thus overruling a need for complicated and laborious patterning methods. Secondly, manufacturing costs can be reduced significantly by introducing this prudent fabrication step for very expensive nanoparticles. Since there are no prior demonstrations of inkjet printing of electroluminescent quantum dot devices in the literature, this work dives into the basics of inkjet printing of low-viscosity, relatively highly volatile quantum dot inks: piezo <b>driver</b> <b>requirements,</b> jetting parameters, fluid dynamics in the cartridge and on the surface, nanoparticle assembly in a wet droplet and packing of dots on the surface are main concerns in the experimental part.

The last part of this dissertation deals with the principles of QDLED displays and their basic components: RGB pixels and organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) drivers. Work related to transistors is intertwined with QDLED work; ideas for surface treatments that enhance nanoparticle packing are carried over from self-assembled monolayer (SAM) studies in the OTFT field. Moreover, all the work done in this thesis project was consolidated by one method, atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is discussed throughout the entire thesis...|$|E
