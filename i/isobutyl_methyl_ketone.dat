40|$|Plastic {{encapsulated}} components contain organics which {{turn into}} volatiles during heat exposures such as during solder reflow or during environmental testing. Moisture turning to steam {{is not the}} only vapor released from plastics during solder reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, the identity and the understanding of these volatiles would be of interest so as to improve manufacturing yields. Some of the vapors evolved during eutectic and lead-free solder reflow profiles of mold compounds are identified in this paper. At eutectic reflow peak temperatures of 220 °C, Epoxy Novolac mold compounds will release gases like carbon dioxide, moisture, methyl alcohol, benzene, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> as the residue solvent, triphenyl phosphine and N,N-dimethyl benzenemethanamine from the catalyst, and sometimes siloxanes from stress releasing agent. Some of the more dominant vapors include triphenyl phosphine(TPP) and triphenyl phosphine oxide(TPPO), water and methyl alcohol. Also, it was found that temperature ramping rates affected the rate of gases released. There was not a substantial difference in the composition of gases released for mold compounds between eutectic solder reflow temperatures and for the higher temperature of 260 °C for lead-free reflow. As expected, much less gas was released if the mold compounds were postmold cured for 4 hours. Gas evolution from polymer during heat exposure is inevitable, however, understanding evolved gas behavior can help reduce the amount evolved such as through proper material selection, post-curing and slower ramp-up, consequently this will improve adhesion variability and pop-corn susceptibility...|$|E

Several non-halogenated solvents (<b>methyl</b> <b>isobutyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> <b>methyl</b> ethyl <b>ketone,</b> and butyl acetate and ethyl acetate) were found to effectively dissolve the polymer. Isoamyl alcohol {{was found to be}} not suitable for extraction of polymer. All PHA extractions were performed from both dry and wet cells at volumes ranging from 2 [*]mL to 3 [*]L using a PHA to solvent ratio of 2 % (w/v). Ethyl acetate showed both high recovery levels and high product purities (up to 99 %) when using dry cells as starting material. Recovery from wet cells, however, eliminates a biomass drying step during the downstream process, potentially saving time and cost. When wet cells were used, <b>methyl</b> <b>isobutyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MIBK) was shown to be the most favorable solvent for PHA recovery. Purities of up to 99 % and total recovery yields of up to 84 % from wet cells were reached. During polymer recovery with either MIBK or butyl acetate, fractionation of the extracted PHA occurred, based on the HHx content of the polymer. PHA with higher HHx content (17 – 30 [*]mol%) remained completely in solution, while polymer with a lower HHx content (11 – 16 [*]mol%) formed a gel-like phase. All PHA in solution could be precipitated by addition of threefold volumes of n-hexane or n-heptane to unfiltered PHA solutions. Effective recycling of the solvents in this system is predicted due to the large differences in the boiling points between solvent and precipitant. Our findings show that two non-halogenated solvents are good candidates to replace halogenated solvents like chloroform for recovery of high quality PHA. Biotechnol.
