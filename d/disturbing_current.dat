(The dissenters included some lower-level employees in the Department of State, CIA, the U.S. military, and U.S. journalists in South Vietnam.) The ink was barely dry on NSAM 273 when those optimistic assessments turned pessimistic. With dissention increasing among U.S. policy makers (Ambassador Lodge vs General Harkins in Saigon; General Taylor vs other military leaders in Washington) and reports of Viet Cong successes, Johnson sent McNamara and Taylor back to Vietnam for another assessment. McNamara's report of 20 December 1963 was far more pessimistic that his previous assessments. He said, [...] "The situation is very <b>disturbing.</b> <b>Current</b> trends, unless reversed in the next 2-3 months, will lead to neutralization at best and most likely to a Communist-controlled state." [...] McNamara also criticized the ineffectiveness of the new South Vietnamese government, formed after the assassination of President Diem.|$|E

Major progress and immense range of biometric applications in banking, national identity, law enforcement, immigration, and {{logical access control}} have projected face recognition technology into the spotlight. Though earlier, simple geometric models were used for face recognition but now the recognition process has graduated into a science of much more sharp and mature mathematical representations and matching processes. This paper reviews the existing approaches of face recognition techniques and offers some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. A number of typical appearance and feature based approaches are discussed.

40|$|Abstract – We {{present a}} method to jointly {{optimize}} the cost {{and the performance of}} delivering traffic from an online service provider (OSP) network to its users. Our method, called Entact, is based on two key techniques. First, it uses a novel route-injection mechanism to measure the performance of alternative paths that are not being currently used, without <b>disturbing</b> <b>current</b> traffic. Second, based on the cost, performance, traffic, and link capacity information, it computes the optimal cost vs. performance curve for the OSP. Each point on the curve represents a potential operating point for the OSP such that no other operating point offers a simultaneous improvement in cost and performance. The OSP can then pick the operating point that represents the desired trade-off (e. g., the “sweet spot”). We evaluate the benefit and overhead of Entact using trace-driven evaluation in a large OSP with 11 geographically distributed data centers. We find that by using Entact this OSP can reduce its traffic cost by 40 % without any increase in path latency and with acceptably low overheads. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{wildlife}} and domestic herbivore waterhole use count data {{collected in the}} South Eastern Lowveld of Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2011, we tested whether there was any significant overlap by wild and domestic herbivores {{in the use of}} waterholes located; 1) inside a wildlife protected area, 2) at the boundary of the protected and agricultural areas and 3) in the agricultural areas. We also explored whether species diversity at these three land uses vary significantly. Our results showed overlap in place and time between wild and domestic herbivores especially in the use of waterholes located at the boundary of the protected areas and at one waterhole located in the agricultural areas. Results also indicated that overall, 95 % of wild herbivores prefered using waterholes located inside the protected area. Results of this study further demonstrated that animal species diversity declines significantly along a gradient from protected areas to agricultural areas. Overall, results of this study imply that the current emerging disease interface between wildlife and livestock may not necessarily be due to direct physical interaction between disease reservoir hosts or even sharing of same waterholes at the same time but rather an indirect contact. These findings could provide an important avenue of investigating livestock and wildlife disease outbreaks at the domestic -wildlife interface which are <b>disturbing</b> <b>current</b> efforts to improve livestock production as well as biodiversity conservation in African savannas.

A cost-effective solution is proposed based on open source software components, and, where appropriate, our own software solutions, for large scientific applications {{in the public sector}} such as universities and research institutes. In such institutions, classical solutions for HPC are often not affordable, yet they usually have at their disposal a large number of machines that can be utilised. The Department of Informatics at University of Sussex, for example, has just installed 150 new Core 2 Duo machines across 3 laboratories. By scaling this number up across the whole University, it can result a large potential computing resource for utilization. Typical processor usage rates are often somewhere between 10 % and 20 % (i. e. user-generated processes) for most machines. This paper proposes a solution that exploits the remaining 80 % to 90 % processor power through consumption of available computer idle time without <b>disturbing</b> <b>current</b> users. To achieve this goal, the open source Condor High Throughput Computing software was selected and implemented as a desktop Grid computing solution.

We {{admit that}} a couple of field-aligned {{currents}} (FAC) of the classic substorm current wedge (SCW) is closed by the dusk-to-dawn current in the plasma sheet of the near- and midtail, and that the mentioned current disrupts the tail main current flowing dawn-to-dusk. We set a simple model of the disruption region, and admitted that the intensity of the <b>disturbing</b> <b>current,</b> J, is equal to the intensity of FAC, inflowing in the dawn sector of the ionospheric projection of SCW. On such a basis, using the 14 Sep 2004 substorm data, we calculated the values of J, also components Jx and Jy along and across the tail, respectively. For this purpose, by means of the magnetogram inversion technique, maps of the FAC density spatial distribution in the polar ionosphere were calculated. We made calculations separately for the two subsequent phases of the substorm- the pseudobreakup phase (PSR), and the following expansion phase (TLR). We noted that the PSR development in the near tail and sudden expansion of disturbance to the mid- and distant tail both were stimulated by the IMF turning northward. In the SCW current disruption region of the trail, the condition for the dynamo-region, j·E < 0, is satisfied. Further, we obtained estimates of the disrupted magnetic field (B), induction emf (∆U), and disturbance power (Qscw). As disturbances in the PSR region do not cease, but even increase during the TLR, we also obtained the J and Qscw values, and the values of B, ∆U separately for the PSR and TLR areas, and on the PSR+TLR aggregate area. We found that all the four- J, B, ∆U and Qscw- values for the time interval and on the PSR+TLR area manyfold or by an order of magnitude more than for the time interval and in the PSR area. 1...|$|E
40|$|The <b>disturbing</b> <b>current</b> {{situation}} {{regarding the}} world climate has initiated a major wave of urgent developments towards decreasing the overall impact of human {{activities on the}} living environment. A major role player in this development is the automobile industry that is inherently connected to pollution of various types, be it air, water or noise pollution. There have been drastic changes {{not only in the}} technologies employed in producing vehicles and components, but also in the construction and technologies built into modern automobiles to lessen the overall environmental impact of the industry. Noxious emissions have been decreased, overall efficiencies increased and vehicles are becoming more economical with each new generation. Stricter laws dictate that the level of acceptable vehicle emissions is to be decreased ever further and all manufacturers are developing various possibilities to achieve this. With the emergence of hybrid vehicle technology, there was also a sudden development of different electrical systems that were made viable by the higher onboard voltage systems employed in hybrid vehicles. One of these developments was the electrical air conditioning compressor for use in automobile applications. Although it is designed to operate with a higher voltage than the traditional 12 V onboard vehicle systems, it is theoretically possible to incorporate it into a 12 V system by making use of a DC-DC converter to step up the supply voltage of the electrical compressor sufficiently to allow for its successful operation. The question therefore arises whether it would be feasible and sensible to employ an electrical air conditioning system in conventional combustion engine vehicles from an overall fuel consumption and vehicle emissions point of view. A modelling approach was taken where an overall vehicle driving simulation was created to represent an average modern production vehicle. The simulation was then extended to include the options of incorporating models for both mechanically and electrically driven air conditioning systems. This provides insight into the influences of the air conditioning system on the vehicle’s overall fuel consumption and an opportunity to compare the influences from the two different systems. This study attempted to provide answers to some of the viability questions regarding the incorporation of electrically driven air conditioning systems into vehicles that use standard 12 V onboard voltage systems. It was found that the electrical system has definite potential as a viable replacement option for the conventional system should it be combined with an appropriate alternator and equipped with an efficient control syste...|$|E

The procedure requires adequate application of large electrodes on the patient chest, to ensure low-resistance electrical contact. The current density distribution under the electrodes is non-uniform, leading to muscle contraction and pain, or risks of burning. The recent introduction of automatic external defibrillators and even wearable defibrillators, presents new demanding requirements for the structure of electrodes. Method and Results Using the pseudo-elliptic differential equation of Laplace type with appropriate boundary conditions and applying finite element method modeling, electrodes of various shapes and structure were studied. The non-uniformity of the current density distribution was shown to be moderately improved by adding a low resistivity layer between the metal and tissue and by a ring around the electrode perimeter. The inclusion of openings in long-term wearable electrodes additionally <b>disturbs</b> the <b>current</b> density profile. However, a number of small-size perforations may result in acceptable current density distribution. Conclusion The current density distribution non-uniformity of circular electrodes is about 30 % less than that of square-shaped electrodes. The use of an interface layer of intermediate resistivity, comparable to that of the underlying tissues, and a high-resistivity perimeter ring, can further improve the distribution. The inclusion of skin aeration openings <b>disturbs</b> the <b>current</b> paths, but an appropriate selection of number and size provides a reasonable compromise. </p...|$|R
