5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> push {{with these two}} programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> write a song about dead things coming to life. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried to put everything I could into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E
500|$|The Doors had {{achieved}} commercial and critical success by 1969, but {{for much of}} that year, they were blacklisted from radio playlists and their concert bookings dwindled, after singer Jim Morrison {{had been charged with}} profanity and indecent exposure stemming from a concert in Miami, Florida, on March 1. Promoters feared another episode like this. Morrison, who craved recognition as a serious poet and had also begun dabbling in film, had mentioned leaving the group at the end of 1968, only to be convinced by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to stay on another six months. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted for the Miami incident. In a 1971 interview with Ben Fong-Torres, Morrison said of Miami, [...] "I think subconsciously <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get across in that concert, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reduce it to absurdity.

[...] A series of Cézanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story.
