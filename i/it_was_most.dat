5|$|Beechwood is {{an estate}} built in 1780; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> notably {{the home of}} National City Bank {{president}} Frank A. Vanderlip and his family. The mansion {{has gone through a}} number of expansions and renovations; the most recent involved dividing the mansion into three segments for use as condominiums. Beechwood was a filming location of the 1970 film House of Dark Shadows, and a filming location and the primary setting of Savages, a 1972 Merchant Ivory film.|$|E
5|$|In a 1974 {{review of}} Miocene European talpids, John Howard Hutchison {{wrote that the}} astragalus of Veratalpa lacked any {{features}} that would ally it with talpids and commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely a rodent.

5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing consensus that the genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, {{as well as their}} entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Historian Gérard Prunier, in a book written shortly after the incident, {{concluded}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

5|$|The {{production}} and {{an adaptation of}} Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle. The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared to Joseph Jefferson's portrayal on the stage. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The adaptation differs from the original in some ways, including that Winkle's cantankerous wife has remarried instead of died.|$|E

5|$|Theoktistos led the Byzantine army in {{against the}} invaders, but was heavily {{defeated}} at Mauropotamos ("Black River"). The {{location of the}} latter, if indeed it is a river and not a simple toponym, is disputed; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely {{a tributary of the}} Sangarius in Bithynia or of the Halys in Cappadocia. Not only did the Byzantines suffer heavy casualties, but many senior Byzantine officials defected to the Arabs. Theoktistos returned to Constantinople, where he blamed Bardas for the recent defeats and had him exiled from the capital.|$|E

5|$|When Gümüshtekin, {{governor}} of Aleppo, {{one of the}} last independent Muslim rulers in Syria after Saladin, had conquered almost all neighboring states, he released Raynald, along with Joscelin of Courtenay and all other Christians prisoners in 1176. Raynald's ransom, fixed at 120,000 gold dinars, reflected his prestige. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> probably paid by ManuelI Komnenos, according to Barber and Bernard Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always found time to visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E

5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling {{on its way to}} becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E
5|$|In early 1888 Joe Warbrick {{attempted}} to organise a private party of Māori players to tour Great Britain—later {{known as the}} New Zealand Native football team. A cousin of Ellison's, Jack Taiaroa, who had toured with the New Zealand team that travelled to New South Wales in 1884, helped Warbrick recruit players for his proposed tour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely because of Taiaroa that Ellison was persuaded to join Warbrick's Natives team. Warbrick eventually assembled a side that included both Māori and non-Māori New Zealand-born players, and several players born overseas. The final team consisted of 26 players, and toured New Zealand before departing to Melbourne. They then toured Great Britain, Australia, and finally New Zealand again—the trip lasted 14 months. Ellison played mostly as a forward throughout the tour, and played at least 83 of the team's 107 matches; including a minimum of 58 in Britain.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866) and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they could count on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then {{selected}} al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which a negotiated settlement was reached. Contrary to the agreed terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who played a crucial role during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely {{based on}} the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
