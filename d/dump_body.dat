This mixture is often called [...] "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> to keep the material warm.

Before the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> can be joined to the frame, the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> components must be assembled and welded together by a dedicated team, requiring seven to ten days per <b>dump</b> <b>body.</b> Final {{assembly of}} one 797 requires a team of seven mechanics working in three shifts around the clock, for 20 days, in addition to the time required to assemble and weld the <b>dump</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{application}} for telescopic cylinders commonly seen {{is that of}} the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> on a dump truck used in a construction site. In order to empty the load of gravel completely, the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> must be raised to an angle of about 60 degrees. To accomplish this long travel with a conventional hydraulic cylinder is very difficult considering that the collapsed length of a single stage rod cylinder is approximately 110% of its output stroke. It would be very challenging for the design engineer to fit the single stage cylinder into the chassis of the dump truck with the <b>dump</b> <b>body</b> in the horizontal rest position. This task is easily accomplished, however, using a telescopic style multi-stage cylinder.|$|E

50|$|An {{articulated}} hauler, articulated {{dump truck}} (ADT), or sometimes a Dump Hauler, {{is a very large}} heavy duty type of dump truck used to transport loads over rough terrain. The vehicle usually has all-wheel drive and consists of two basic units: the front section, generally called the tractor, and the rear section that contains the <b>dump</b> <b>body,</b> called the hauler or trailer section. Steering is made by pivoting the front in relation to the back by hydraulic rams. This way, all wheels follow the same path, making it an excellent off-road vehicle.|$|E

If a 797 must be moved from one job site to another for any reason, {{it can not be}} driven on public roads due to its exceptional size and weight. Moving a 797 requires dis-assembly, loading onto semi-trailer trucks, transport and re-assembly at the new location.|$|E
