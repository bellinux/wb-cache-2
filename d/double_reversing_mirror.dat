40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} monocrystals of Bi_ 1 _ 2 SiO_ 2 _ 0 and Bi_ 1 _ 2 TiO_ 2 _ 0 wide-zone semiconductors. The aim of the {{investigation is}} experimental study of two- and four-wave interactions in Bi_ 1 _ 2 SiO_ 2 _ 0 and Bi_ 1 _ 2 TiO_ 2 _ 0 photorefractive crystals, as well as generation processes on their basis. The holographic recording in the crystals being investigated was made on the wavelengths of helium-neon (lambda = 633 nm), argon (lambda = 514 nm), neodynium (lambda = 1, 06 microm) and semiconductor (lambda = 0, 85 microm) lasers. In {{the majority of the}} experiments an external sign-variable field with a meander shape and frequency of about 70 Hz was applied to the crystals. Reflectionless generation on a basis of the oncoming four-wave interaction in the geometry of the <b>double</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>mirror</b> with the orthogonal polarization of pumping beams has been first theoretically predicted. A calculation of efficiency of the two-wave power-exchange in the crystals with a small drift lengthof free charge carriers has been performed. A possibility of constructing practically all currently known generators on two- and four-wave interaction in the photorefractive medium on a basis of Bi_ 1 _ 2 TiO_ 2 _ 0 crystals in the external sign-variable field has been first shown.

5000|$|A {{variation}} of this play is a <b>double</b> <b>reverse,</b> {{in which the}} second ball-carrier takes the ball all or part way back across the field before he too hands off to a teammate running in the opposite direction.

40|$|University of Minnesota dissertation. August 2009. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisors: Jennifer J. McComas,LeAnne Johnson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 136 pages, appendices A-C. Perspective-taking, {{the ability to}} respond based on information about oneself and others, {{is an important part}} of social interactions. Children who are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often lack perspective-taking, and this deficit can detrimentally impact the quality of their social interactions. In recent years, a behavioral account of language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory, has taught various levels of perspective-taking complexity. Simple, <b>reversed,</b> and <b>double</b> <b>reversed</b> relations, through targeting, I-You, Here-There, and Now-Then relations have been established using the Barnes-Holmes protocol. To date, the training protocol has been evaluated using typically developing individuals and has yet to be used for individuals with perspective-taking deficits. The current study extends pervious research by teaching children with ASD perspective-taking relations, evaluating the influence of teaching on generalized responding, and briefly evaluating the impact of individualized training on perspective-taking acquisition, using the Barnes-Holmes protocol. Participants included three boys ranging from nine to ten years old, diagnosed with Asperger's. Findings indicated that only one participant was able to master simple, <b>reversed,</b> and <b>double</b> <b>reversed</b> perspective-taking relations using the training protocol. Additionally, acquiring simple, <b>reversed,</b> and <b>double</b> <b>reversed</b> perspective-taking relations did not consistently result in acquisition of untrained responses across participants. Finally, preliminary findings indicate individualization of training protocols may be necessary for promoting acquisition of perspective-taking relations...|$|R
