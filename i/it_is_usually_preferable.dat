40|$|This lecture makes {{explicit}} a theme introduced surreptitiously last lecture: exact recovery. The {{genre of}} question in this sequence of lectures is: for an algorithm A of interest, for which inputs does A {{solve the problem}} exactly? For example, last lecture, we proved that the single-link++ algorithm recovers the optimal solution in every 3 -stable k-median instance. (See Homework # 4 for an improvement.) 1 We generally think of the algorithm A above as either: (i) an already-implemented algo-rithm that is available to us, such as a linear programming solver; or (ii) a relatively simple algorithm {{that we have a}} good understanding of and could code up easily. The reason is that, in practice, designing a new algorithm from scratch is often a last resort. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> far <b>preferable</b> if something in the current algorithmic toolbox is good enough, at least for the problem instances relevant to the application. The exact recovery results in this sequence of lectures develop theoretical guarantees that correspond well to this style of thinking. 2 This lecture covers another case study on exact recovery, for a graph cut problem. We’ll retain from last lecture the definition of γ-stable instances and the flavor of the problems studied, as cut problems are a type of clustering problem. What will be different is the algorithms studied — linear programming instead of more elementary algorithms. The broader theme, to be elaborated on in future lectures, is to explain when NP-hard problems can be solved exactly via linear programming. (Since linear programs can be solved in polynomial time, we do not expect this to be true for worst-case instances.) Thus, even ∗ c© 2014, Tim Roughgarden...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{physical}} reasons {{fracture toughness}} KJc of ferritic steels in the brittle-to-ductile transition regime {{is affected by}} a pronounced scatter, which requires statistical methods to be applied for evaluation of test results {{as well as for}} application in safety analysis of structures.

However, for engineering purposes like a screening safety analysis of a defect-containing component <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>preferable</b> to use a deterministic lower bound. However, within the framework of ASTM-standards there is no possibility to determine KIc experimentally. So KIc needs to be determined indirectly from the reference temperature T 0.

40|$|International audienceThe {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B is now {{based on the}} using of pegylated interferon or nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. In the majority of cases, these drugs can control viral replication with an hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA negativation after approximately 6 months of therapy.

40|$|Diagnosis {{applications}} {{relying on}} Artificial Intelligence methods {{must deal with}} uncertain knowledge and fuzzy inputdata. Besides other methods, classical probybility theory has been realized by many authors to be useful for such tasks, given that tools are available, making its application more handy. One such tool are Bayesian Networks (causal probabilistic networks, belief networks). While {{the construction of the}} graph of a Bayesian Network along causal dependencies is often quite easy, it is usually difficult to specify the necessary probabilities, i. e. for every node the probabilities that its variable assumes a certain value given the predecessors values. Instead, in practical applications, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>preferable</b> to specify an unordered set of conditional probabilities, which does not necessarily match the set of probabilities in the network. Such a set of probabilities has the potential problem of being neither consistent nor complete with respect to the compound distribution of all random variables in the net. It is shown, that a test for consistency and completeness and answering queries about the compound probability can in general be done by solving a nonlinear equation system. However, due to the inherent complexity of solving such a system, this is in general not feasible.

40|$|Some {{teachers}} of biochemistry think it positively beneficial {{for students to}} struggle with difficult mathematics. I do not number myself among these people, although I have derived much personal pleasure {{from the study of}} mathematics and from applying it to problems that interest me in biochemistry. On the contrary, I think that students choose courses in biochemistry out of interest in biochemistry and that they should not be encumbered with more mathematics than is absolutely required for a proper understanding of biochemistry. This of course includes physical chemistry, because a biochemist ignorant of physical chemistry is no biochemist. I have been guided by these beliefs in writing this book. I have laid heavy emphasis on those topics, {{such as the use of}} logarithms, that play an important role in biochemistry and often cause problems in teaching; I have ignored others, such as trigonometry, that one can manage without. The proper treatment of statistics has been more difficult to decide.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>preferable</b> {{to model}} and {{estimate}} prevalence ratios instead of odds ratios in cross-sectional studies when diseases or injuries are not rare. Problems with existing methods of modeling prevalence ratios include lack of convergence, overestimated standard errors, and extrapolation of simple univariate formulas to multivariable models. We compare {{two of the}} newer methods using simulated data and real data from SAS online examples. Methods The Robust Poisson method, which uses the Poisson distribution and a sandwich variance estimator, is compared to the log-binomial method, which uses the binomial distribution to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, using computer simulations and real data. Results For very high prevalences and moderate sample size, the Robust Poisson method yields less biased estimates of the prevalence ratios than the log-binomial method. However, for moderate prevalences and moderate sample size, the log-binomial method yields slightly less biased estimates than the Robust Poisson method. In nearly all cases, the log-binomial method yielded slightly higher power and smaller standard errors than the Robust Poisson method. Conclusion Although the Robust Poisson often gives reasonable estimates of the prevalence ratio and {{is very easy to}} use, the log-binomial method results in less bias in most common situations, and because it fits the correct model and obtains maximum likelihood estimates, it generally results in slightly higher power, smaller standard errors, and, unlike the Robust Poisson, it always yields estimated prevalences between zero and one. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of powerful consumer-level smart devices and off-the-shelf software frameworks has tremendously popularized augmented reality (AR) applications. However, since the built-in cameras typically have rather limited field of view, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>preferable</b> to position AR tools built upon these devices {{at a distance}} when large objects need to be tracked for augmentation. This arrangement makes it difficult or even impossible to physically interact with the augmented object. One solution is to adopt third person perspective (TPP) with which the smart device shows in real time the object to be interacted with, the AR information and the user herself, all captured by a remote camera. Through mental transformation between the user-centric coordinate space and the coordinate system of the remote camera, the user can directly interact with objects in the real world. To evaluate user performance under this cognitively demanding situation, we developed such an experimental TPP AR system and conducted experiments which required subjects to make markings on a whiteboard according to virtual marks displayed by the AR system. The same markings were also made manually with a ruler. We measured the precision of the markings {{as well as the}} time to accomplish the task. Our results show that although the AR approach was on average around half a centimeter less precise than the manual measurement, it was approximately three times as fast as the manual counterpart. Additionally, we also found that subjects could quickly adapt to the mental transformation between the two coordinate systems...|$|E

40|$|Old-growth {{forests are}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} large and very large trees. The estimation of their wood volume and biomass is essential in order to monitor the ecological processes in these stands and their contribution to carbon cycle. However, conventional wood volume estimation techniques based on mensuration of stem diameter at breast height and tree height is most often unfeasible for large and very large trees in old-growth forests because volume models or tables are usually elaborated from trees of smaller size grown up in regularly managed forest stands. Random Branch Sampling (RBS) is often proposed as a possible estimation alternative under such conditions. Starting from the ground level some of the parts of the main trunk and of the branches are sampled and measured to estimate the overall wood volume (or other biophysical variables). The application of RBS in old-growth forests, where tree cutting is usually forbidden or very difficult, requires that the crown of the tree can physically be reached to measure the sampled parts. We argue that under such conditions <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>preferable</b> to fully measure all the components of the tree crown because RBS estimates are not precise if based on only one sampling path and that, on the other hand, measuring the main trunk and all the branches by tree-climbing consumes the same time as replicating several RBS paths on the same tree. To demonstrate our hypothesis we selected 16 large beech trees located in the old-growth forest of Mount Cimini in Central Italy. Using a modern tree-climbing approach the main trunk and all the branches were measured and recorded in the field. The database was used to simulate RBS paths. Real values from volume census were contrasted with estimates based on RBS. On the whole, RBS estimates based on one single path prove to be highly imprecise. Even for trees characterized by a rather regular form, at least three RBS paths should be repeated on the same tree to maintain the relative standard error under or near 15 %. This paper introduces the problem and describes the experimental test. The results are discussed under the perspective of standardized application of the proposed methodology.
