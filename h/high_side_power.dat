Bipolar gate signals are usually preferred for high switching dynamic control and power device shielding. Nevertheless, bipolar supplies are harder to implement and rely on numerous components that may result in significant reduction of overall converter robustness. An alternative solution is to use unipolar supplies which are more complex but integrable with specific gate driver circuits. The addition of resonant structure gives the possibilities for involving {{the efficiency of the}} gate driver and reducing further gate driver supply requirements. The paper presents theses issues based on several gate drivers and thei rsupplies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — {{this paper}} {{presents}} several charge- discharge blocks for gate driver circuit of a high side automotive power switch. A comparison of these topologies regarding electromagnetic emissions is achieved. I. INDRODUCTION In nowadays automotive circuitry an important role is played by the power switch. This is used to drive different types of loads, from bulbs to leds. This paper is focused on a new technique to charge the gate of a <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>power</b> switch for a good EMC behavior. Three different command circuits are analyzed and simulated in order to estimate the low frequency electromagnetic emissions. II.

40|$|The dynamic {{supply current}} testing {{based on the}} {{measurement}} of voltage drop across a parasitic resistance of the supply voltage metal routing is presented. Auto-zero technique for voltage comparator offset cancelation, which provides very accurate and sensitive low voltage drop measurement across the sensing resistor is proposed. Therefore, the proposed sensor might {{be used as a}} current monitor for dynamic current testing of mixed-signal circuits without any additional element necessarily connected in series with the power supply line. In the proposed defect localization methodology, the mixed-signal chip is split into smaller blocks and each block is tested independently. Then the results are evaluated in the common control part, which provides the information about a defective part and shifts this data to a serial data output pin. Therefore, with only one additional pin we may exactly localize the defective part of the integrated system. A USB (universal serial bus) <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>power</b> distribution switch was used as an experimental mixed-signal device under test (DUT). The proposed current monitor together with the localization technique was implemented into a circuit under test and the whole experimental chip was designed in a standard 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed test and localization methodology were evaluated and the obtained results are presented.

50|$|Charge {{pumps are}} often used in H-Bridges in <b>high</b> <b>side</b> drivers for gate driving the <b>high</b> <b>side</b> {{n-channel}} <b>power</b> MOSFETs and IGBTs. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} <b>high</b> <b>side</b> FET gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{recent advances}} and breakthroughs {{of an alternative}} 3 D packaging solution for vertical power devices. Direct bonding technology and trench isolation used for power device islanding are the cornerstone of this scheme of integration. Involving direct copper bonding layers, the technology is used during the mid-process to enable the wafer level bonding of vertical power devices to a joint metallic substrate while optimizing the devices intrinsic performances. Wafer level islanding and interconnect is used to simplify and guarantee the true 3 D assembly at module level. This 3 D assembly {{is based on the}} interconnect of matrices of low <b>side</b> and <b>high</b> <b>side</b> vertical <b>power</b> devices on top of each other. Our technology optimizes component surface height as well as alignments constraints. As a result, the true 3 D integration of the active parts for power converters is optimized to the highest possible level, leading to strongly reduced EMI levels and increased switching speed capabilities. Key challenges, both on design, fabrication and implementation are presented, and the first prototypes based on four switching cells of vertical 500 V power diodes and MOSFETs are introduced...|$|R

40|$|Today’s servers and {{high-end}} {{desktop computer}} CPUs require peak currents of around 60 A- 80 A and next generation processors {{will be in}} the order of 100 A. Similarly, the transient response in today’s CPUs is in the order of 30 A/us while next generation processors are anticipated to exceed 300 A/us. This paper will show a simple method of achieving these extremely high currents simply, efficiently and with the minimum footprint. Power Design Challenges The demands of high current, low voltage and fast transient response microprocessors or ASICs present a great challenge for power designers that are required to provide efficient power supplies in the smallest board area when converting from intermediate supply voltage rails to very low voltage outputs. Figure 1 : Simplified power loss equations As the ratio of output voltage to input voltage increases, and/or switching frequency increases, the <b>high</b> and low <b>side</b> <b>power</b> MOSFET switches must be carefully optimized and balanced for the application as outlined in the power loss equations of Figure 1 (ref. 1).

40|$|Line drop compensation, <b>high</b> <b>side</b> voltage control, {{secondary}} voltage control — why not control {{a generator like}} a static var compensator? Abstract: Generators typically regulate terminal voltage via automatic voltage regulator and exciter equipment. The desired <b>high</b> <b>side</b> (transmission side) voltage schedule is usually maintained by the power plant operator or by slow SCADA-type process control computers. Power system dynamic performance, however, can be improved by faster regulation of the transmission voltage. Contrasted to generators, static var compensators are designed specifically for transmission voltage regulation. The transmission voltage is directly regulated at high speed. Total SVC and medium voltage component reactive power ratings are referred to the transmission side. All medium voltage equipment are designed to support the transmission <b>side</b> reactive <b>power</b> and voltage regulation requirements. The droop (slope) setting is usually small compared to generators regulating terminal voltage. This paper introduces the panel session on {{secondary voltage}} control. I outline various methods for tighter <b>high</b> <b>side</b> voltage control, with emphasis on control of hydro generation in the U. S. Pacific Northwest...|$|R

40|$|C-core linear flux-switching {{permanent}} magnet (PM) machines (LFSPMs) are attracting {{more and more}} attention due to their advantages of simplicity and robustness of the secondary <b>side,</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> density and high torque density, in which both PMs and armature windings are housed in the primary side. The primary salient tooth wound with a concentrated winding consists of C-shaped iron core segments between which PMs are sandwiched and the magnetization directions of these PMs are adjacent and alternant in the horizontal direction. On the other hand, the secondary side is composed of a simple iron core with salient teeth {{so that it is}} very suitable for long stroke applications. However, the detent force of the C-core LFSPM machine is relatively high and the magnetic circuit is unbalanced due to the end effect. Thus, a new multiple additional tooth which consists of an active and a traditional passive additional tooth, is employed at each end side of the primary in this paper, so that the asymmetry due to end effect can be depressed and the detent force can be reduced by adjusting the passive additional tooth position. By using the finite element method, the characteristics and performances of the proposed machine are analyzed and verified...|$|R
