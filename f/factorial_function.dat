25|$|A single-argument version f(n) = A(n, n) that {{increases}} both m and n {{at the same}} time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the exponential function, the <b>factorial</b> <b>function,</b> multi- and superfactorial functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that f(n) is roughly comparable to fω(n) in the fast-growing hierarchy. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that f, which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a Turing machine and so is a computable function, grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.|$|E

500|$|Pierre Rémond de Montmort, in {{collaboration}} with Nicolaus Bernoulli, wrote a book on probability Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard which appeared in 1708, which {{can be seen as}} an extension of the Part III of Ars Conjectandi which applies combinatorics and probability to analyze games of chance commonly played at that time. Abraham de Moivre also wrote extensively on the subject in De mensura sortis: Seu de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus of 1711 and its extension [...] The Doctrine of Chances or, a Method of Calculating the Probability of Events in Play of 1718. De Moivre's most notable achievement in probability was the discovery of the first instance of central limit theorem, by which he was able to approximate the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. To achieve this De Moivre developed an asymptotic sequence for the <b>factorial</b> <b>function</b> —- which we now refer to as Stirling's approximation —- and Bernoulli's formula for the sum of powers of numbers. Both Montmort and de Moivre adopted the term probability from Jacob Bernoulli, which had not been used in all the previous publications on gambling, and both their works were enormously popular.|$|E

Ehrenborg and Readdy [ER 2] gave a complete classification of the <b>factorial</b> <b>functions</b> of infinite Eulerian binomial posets and infinite Eulerian Sheffer posets, where infinite posets are those posets which contain an infinite chain. We answer questions asked by R. Ehrenborg and M. Readdy [ER 2].

This work is also motivated by the work of R. Stanley about recognizing the boolean lattice by looking at smaller intervals. In the second topic concerns lattice path matroid polytopes. The theory of matroid polytopes has gained prominence due to its applications in algebraic geometry, combinatorial optimization, Coxeter group theory, and, most recently, tropical geometry. In general matroid polytopes are not well understood. Lattice path matroid polytopes (LPMP) belong to two famous classes of polytopes, sorted closed matroid polytopes [LP] and polypositroids [Pos]. We study several properties of LPMPs and build a new connection between the theories of matroid polytopes and lattice paths. I investigate many properties of LPMPs, including their face structure, decomposition, and triangulations, as well as formulas for calculating their Ehrhart polynomial and volume. by Hoda Bidkhori.
