This paper {{compares the}} {{accuracy}} of combined classifiers in medical <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> to the same knowledge discovery techniques applied to generic <b>data</b> <b>bases.</b> Specifically, we apply Bagging and Boosting methods for 16 medical and 16 generic <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> and compare the accuracy results with a more traditional approach (C 4. 5 algorithm). Bagging and Boosting methods are applied using different numbers of classifiers and the accuracy is computed using a cross-validation technique. This paper main contribution resides in recommend the most accurate method and possible parameterization for medical <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> and an initial identification of some characteristics that make medical <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> different from generic ones. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{clinical}} laboratories use computerized laboratory information systems for data acquisition, data management, and report generation. Although the research potential of the large machine-readable <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> generated by these systems is often mentioned, there has been comparatively little actual use of <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> for research. This presentation will briefly present four research studies using laboratory <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> and discuss the problems which were encountered in acquiring, characterizing, and maintaining these <b>data</b> <b>bases.</b> The use of medical records, pharmacy, financial, and other machine-readable <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> available in many hospitals will be discussed. The problems encountered {{with the use of}} coded diagnosis and operations records in combination with laboratory data are of particular concern. Finally, the use of clinical laboratory systems in conjunction with total hospital information systems for the accumulation of research <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> will be illustrated. It is particularly important that the lessons learned to date be incorporated into planning for the use of hospital information systems in research so that the enormous potential of these systems can be realized...|$|R

40|$|E-government concept, {{defined as}} the use of {{information}} technologies (Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) that have the ability to transform relations between citizens, businesses, and other branch of the government, has been adopted by many government agencies. In general, there are two most important applications; interactive web maps that can be queried on Internet and spatial <b>data</b> <b>based</b> e-government information that can be accessed by the clients or public on the Internet. In Turkey, in spite of fact that non-spatial <b>data</b> <b>based</b> e-government applications have shown a great improvement, there has been little progress in spatial <b>data</b> <b>based</b> e-government applications. Effective use of Web-based e-government applications reduces user time, saves money, and increases efficiency.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Boeing Commercial Airplane Group uses {{a highly}} {{computerized}} Flight Test system. Everything from test planning to equipment control is handled {{through a large}} mainframe computer. This paper is {{an introduction to the}} structures which are necessary to efficiently run tests on many different airplanes at the same time, {{with a wide range of}} test requirements. This paper discusses the <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> required, the test planning and the procedures used to run a flight test program. Some <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> are common to all test programs while others are specific to a particular test program. The test planning begins with the Instrumentation Requirements estimating process. Then comes selecting parameters from the common <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> and marking them as required for a particular test program. New parameters are added to the common <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> as required. Once the process of identifying parameters to be recorded is started, the computer automatically generates airplane specific <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> and loads the information from the common <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> into them so that the other groups can select the specific instrumentation to be used to measure each parameter. As this planning is accomplished, information is added to the <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> so that they become more complete as the actual testing approaches, When the airplane enters it's testing phase, the data from these <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> is retrieved and provided to both the on-board data monitor system and the ground station to allow data to be acquired from the data acquisition system or from tape for data processing.
