Except in one case, the relative potencies with which these peptides influenced fluid secretion correlated with the potencies on potassium secretion. [Glu 3]secretin and [Asn 3]secretin were 2 - 3 and 14 times less potent, respectively, than secretin. [Ala 4]secretin, [D-Ala 4]secretin and secretin were almost equipotent.

Little is currently known about its intrinsic elasticity or about the relation between the mechanical properties and function of the membrane. Here we subdivide the TM into three longitudinal regions and five radial zones and map the shear modulus of the TM using atomic force microscopy, and present evidence that the TM elasticity varies radially, after the distribution of type A collagen fibrils. This is seen most dramatically as a decrease in shear modulus in the neighborhood of the sensory hair cells; we argue that this inhomogeneity of properties not only protects the hair bundles but also increases the energy efficiency of the vibrational shearing during sound transduction...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disorders}} {{are the most}} common complications encountered in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The relationship is likely to be multifactorial and may also involve a specific, though ill-defined, diabetic cardiomyopathy. Patients with heart failure accompanied by DM have a reduced cardiac output compared with patients without DM. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARã) and have beneficial effects in the control of blood glucose and cardiovascular parameters, but the ability of these drugs to induce retention of plasma has to be taken into consideration in prescribing them for patients with DM at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanism of fluid retention by TZDs has not been fully elucidated. Available evidence indicate a possible role of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in causing the side effects of TZDs.

By changing the ratio between {{width of the}} pipe and {{the height of the}} granular bed, we observe the transition between the 1 dimensional like state and the actual 2 dimensional state.

40|$|We {{examined}} the biological properties of purified Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin H (STH) using mouse intestinal loop assays and compared these properties {{with those of}} heat-stable enterotoxin I (STI) and cholera toxin (CT). The action of STU over time differed from those of STI and CT. STH did not alter cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP levels in intestinal mucosal cells. Our results supported {{the idea that the}} mechanism of action of STII in <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion is different from the mechanisms of action of STI and CT. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that an anti-STII neutralizing serum did not neutralize the activities of STI and CT.

In particular, small fractions of heavier alloying atoms can lead to the precipitation of intermetallic phases. Moreover, the mainly dendritic structure is also sensitive to fluid flow in the melt. These two factors and their mutual influence is examined in this paper. The solidification of AlSi 7 and AlSi 7 Mn 1 samples was studied while <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> flow by a traveling magnetic field (TMF) of approximately 5 mT strength, traveling up or down the sample axis. All samples were molten and directionally solidified at constant solidification velocities between 0. 03 and 0. 24 mm/s. The application of two separate heaters allowed the fixation of constant temperature gradients in the solid and liquid parts of the samples, the use of a transparent silica aerogel crucible permitted optical verification of the solidification velocity. Cross sections were cut from the processed samples and the microstructure analyzed using light microscopy and SEM-EDX. From these images, values for the primary, secondary and tertiary dendrite arm spacing were retrieved.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} {{numerical}} simulations of temporally evolving, thermally stratified shear flows in superposed porous and pure-fluid domains. In particular, we study {{two different types of}} flows, namely, pressure-driven channel flows and unforced shear layers. Our study is based on a recently developed thermo-mechanical model for flows in the domains of interest. This model follows a mixture-theoretic approach, according to which the medium's porosity is introduced as a concentration parameter, thus allowing the derivation of a single set of equations that is valid simultaneously in both domains. For the types of flows examined herein, our simulations predict the formation of spanwise vortical structures (rollers) at the porous - pure fluid interface. These rollers grow in time thereby <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> circulation inside the porous medium. For the case of pressure-driven channel flows, our simulations further predict the development of plumes of hot and cold fluid due to convective instabilities that interact with the rollers. In the case of unforced shear layers, unstable stratification accelerates the growth of the rollers, which soon start to merge, and enhances fluid mixing. By contrast, the effect of stable stratification is exactly the opposite. Herein we discuss in detail the temporal evolution of the predicted flow structures and the interactions between them, as well as the mechanisms that induce thermal non-equilibrium inside the porous medium...|$|E

Beyond their use in biology, {{functional}} arrays of artificial cilia have been envisaged as a potential biomimetic strategy for <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> flow and mixing in lab-on-a-chip devices. Here we report on fluid transport produced by magnetically actuated arrays of biomimetic cilia whose size approaches that of their biological counterparts, a scale at which advection and diffusion compete to determine mass transport. Our biomimetic cilia recreate the beat shape of embryonic nodal cilia, simultaneously generating two sharply segregated regimes of fluid flow: Above the cilia tips their motion causes directed, long-range fluid transport, whereas below the tips we show that the cilia beat generates an enhanced diffusivity capable of producing increased mixing rates. These two distinct types of flow occur simultaneously and are separated in space by less than 5  μm, approximately 20 % of the biomimetic cilium length. While this suggests that our system may have applications as a versatile microfluidics device, we also focus on the biological implications of our findings. Our statistical analysis of particle transport identifying an enhanced diffusion regime provides novel evidence {{for the existence of}} mixing in ciliated systems, and we demonstrate that the directed transport regime is Poiseuille–Couette flow, the first analytical model consistent with biological measurements of fluid flow in the embryonic node...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: L-Arginine {{has been}} shown to <b>induce</b> <b>fluid</b> {{secretion}} in human jejunum. Nitric oxide, a derivative of L-arginine is thought to have an important role as an intestinal secretagogue. AIM: To determine the effect of L-arginine and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on fluid and electrolyte movement in rat jejunum. METHODS: A 25 cm segment of rat jejunum was perfused in situ with iso-osmotic solutions containing either (1) saline, (2) D-arginine 20, (3) L-arginine 20, (4) L-NAME 0. 1, 1, or 20 mmol/l, or (5) a combination of L-arginine 20 and L-NAME 0. 1, 1, or 20 mmol/l. In further groups the effect of a subcutaneous injection of L-NAME 100 mg/kg was examined in rats pretreated with either D-or L-arginine 500 mg/kg. RESULTS: L-Arginine, unlike D-arginine, <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion despite being better absorbed (mean - 7. 3 v 17. 0 microliters/min/g; p < 0. 01). L-NAME at 0. 1 mmol/l had no effect on basal fluid movement but reversed L-arginine induced secretion (7. 8; p < 0. 05). L-NAME at 1 and 20 mmol/l <b>induced</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion (- 15. 4 and - 28. 4, respectively), which was enhanced by the addition of L-arginine (- 30. 0 and - 41. 0, respectively; both p < 0. 05). A subcutaneous injection of L-NAME resulted in marked fluid secretion (- 39. 9) and histological evidence of intestinal ischaemia. These changes were attenuated or reversed by pretreatment with subcutaneous L- but not D-arginine. CONCLUSIONS: L-arginine <b>induces</b> intestinal <b>fluid</b> secretion through production of nitric oxide. There is a delicate balance between the effect of nitric oxide as a secretagogue and its effect on maintaining blood flow and thus preventing intestinal ischaemia...|$|R

Corona wind heat transfer enhancement is a non-mechanical means of augmenting transfer coefficients in free and low-velocity convection flow fields. Ions formed near the surface of a high-voltage electrode are forced along the electric field lines toward the nearby ground, <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> motion and thereby enhancing convection. This study examines experimentally the resultant heat transfer in the needle-plate, wire-plate and multiple wire-plate configurations. Heat transfer coefficients as high as 70 W/m 2 K are reported. Joule heating of the air is measured, and found to generate a temperature increases of up to 3 'C. The optimum needle and wire heights are found, and the trends in wire-plate performance are examined. A numerical procedure for solving the coupled Poisson and charge conservation equations in the wire-plate geometry is developed. A non-dimensional parameter is defined which allows the dominance of electrostatic over buoyancy forces to be demonstrated. This allows the energy equation to be decoupled from the momentum equation. The SIMPLEC procedure with uneven grid spacing is used to model the resultant flow field. The energy equation is solved in order to calculate the resultant heat transfer coefficients. Excellent agreement between experimental and computed heat transfer coefficients is observed. Novel electrode configurations are considered, and two promising electrode designs are presented...|$|E

If human crews and robotic machinery are {{to operate on}} these regolith covered surfaces, they must face the consequences of interacting with regolith fines which consist of particles below 100 microns in diameter down to as small as submicron scale particles. Such fine dust will intrude into mechanisms and interfaces causing a variety of problems such as contamination of clean fluid lines, jamming of mechanisms and damaging connector seals and couplings. Since multiple elements must be assembled in space for system level functionality, it will be inevitable that interfaces will be necessary for structural connections, and to pass commodities such as cryogenic liquid propellants, purge and buffer gases, water, breathing air, pressurizing gases, heat exchange fluids, power and data.

40|$|Horizontally {{heterogeneous}} Joule heating {{is proposed}} {{as a new}} driving source for fluid motions in the Earth’s inner core. The magnetic field imposed at the inner core boundary (ICB) penetrates into the inner core through diffusion and generates Joule heating. When the heating distribution is horizontally heterogeneous, it produces torque {{by means of the}} buoyancy force, thereby <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> motions in the inner core. The expression of fluid flows induced by arbitrary magnetic field distributions at ICB is obtained analytically. Using the estimated values of the physical parameters of the inner core, the amplitude of the stress field associated with the flows induced by this mechanism is expected to be greater than or approximately {{the same as that of}} the models considered thus far, and is sufficiently large for large scale deformation of the inner core. The flow field by this mechanism is also accompanied by a weak stress field layer near the ICB. The thickness of this boundary layer is comparable to the depth of the weak anisotropy region observed near the ICB. The model presented herein suggests that interactions of the flow and magnetic fields through Joule heating may occur between the inner and outer cores. The flow field induced by Joule heating generates mass exchange through the ICB, causing absorption and release of latent heat and light elements. This process affects the flow field and the dynamo action in the outer core and possibly reflects on the distribution of the magnetic field. The variation of the magnetic field penetrates the ICB again and modifies the distribution of Joule heating and the resultant flow field in the inner core...|$|E

Linaclotide is an FDA-approved oral GUCY 2 C agonist formulated for gastric release, <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> secretion into the small bowel to treat chronic idiopathic constipation. The ability of oral linaclotide to induce a pharmacodynamic response in epithelial cells of the colorectum in humans remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that administration of 0. 87 mg of oral linaclotide daily for 7 days to healthy volunteers, after oral colon preparation with polyethylene glycol solution (MoviPrep), activates GUCY 2 C, resulting in accumulation of its product cyclic (c) GMP in epithelial cells of the cecum, transverse colon, and distal rectum. GUCY 2 C activation by oral linaclotide was associated with homeostatic signaling, including phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and inhibition of proliferation quantified by reduced Ki 67 -positive epithelial cells. In {{the absence of the}} complete oral colonoscopy preparation, linaclotide did not alter cGMP production in epithelial cells of the colorectum, demonstrating that there was an effect related to the laxative preparation.

These {{movements are}} considered the most important in <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> motion in the eye. The fluid that occupies most of the eyeball is called vitreous humour (VH) and is a complex, gel-like viscoelastic fluid. It is known that VH is only produced during the embryonic stage and becomes progressively liquefied with age, {{and as a consequence}} its rheological properties change. The opensource software OpenFOAM was used to investigate the dynamic response of VH during saccadic movements. Viscoelastic fluid flow solvers were adapted to work with dynamic meshes. The flow behaviour of the biofluid was studied on a simplified vitreous cavity and on a realistic eye chamber geometry. Saccadic movements with rotations between 10 ̊ and 50 ̊ were studied considering both Newtonian and viscoelastic fluid models, where the parameters for the latter were obtained by fitting the Giesekus model to rheological data measured experimentally. The results show that different degrees of rotation of saccadic movements produce distinct maximum angular velocities and consequently differences in the velocity profiles within the vitreous cavity. Changes in the viscosity of the fluid also affect significantly the results as consequence of the impact of viscosity on the diffusive time scale of the VH velocity field development. Moreover, the elastic behaviour of the fluid affects the velocity field and the stresses acting on the walls.

This paper focuses on a theoretical and experimental study of magnetohydrodynamic flows in a conduit with a rectangular cross section. The conduit is equipped with individually controlled electrodes uniformly spaced at a pitch L. The electrodes are aligned transversely to the conduit 2 ̆ 7 s axis. The entire device is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. The electrodes are {{divided into two groups}} A and C {{in such a way that}} there is an electrode of group C between any two electrodes of group A.

When positive and negative potentials are, respectively, applied to the even and odd numbered A electrodes, opposing electric currents are induced on the right and left hand sides of each A electrode. These currents generate transverse forces that drive cellular convection in the conduit. We refer to the resulting flow pattern as A. When electrodes of group C are activated, a similar flow pattern results, albeit shifted in space. We refer to this flow pattern as C. By alternating periodically between patterns A and C, one induces Lagrangian chaos. Such chaotic advection may be beneficial for stirring fluids, particularly in microfluidic devices.

Ricinoleic acid (the active principle of castor oil) was the more potent, producing fluid secretion when perfused at concentrations at which oleic acid was without effect.

Addition of lecithin and monoolein did not diminish the secretory effect of ricinoleic acid; addition of a secretory bile acid (taurodeoxycholate) did not enhance the effect.

The single pass perfusion technique was used to study fluid movement in a 25 cm segment of rat jejunum in vivo. A solution containing 20 mml-arginine, a NO precursor, was perfused into the segment. The effect of the NO synthase inhibitors (l-NAME and l-nitroindazole (l-NI)) and the VIP antagonist ([4 Cl-D-Phe 6,Leu 17]VIP (VIPa)) on l-arginine-induced changes in fluid movement, expressed as μl min− 1 (g dry intestinal weight) − 1, was determined. In addition, the effect of neuronal blockade by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and ablation of the myenteric plexus by benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was studied. In parallel groups of rats, the effect of l-NAME and l-NI on VIP-induced intestinal fluid secretion was also examined. Basal fluid absorption in control rats was (median (interquartile range)) 65 (45 – 78). l-Arginine induced a significant fluid secretion (− 14 (− 20 to − 5); P < 0. 01). This effect was reversed completely by l-NAME (60 (36 – 65); P < 0. 01) and l-NI (46 (39 – 75); P < 0. 01) and partially by VIPa (37 (14 – 47); P < 0. 01).

Analysis of all samples under TMF influence show a segregational effect from the inner region to the outer ring of the sample; depending on the orientation of the TMF, dendrites cluster towards the sample center while the eutectic phase cumulates near the outer rim, or vice versa. Contrary to the commonly used rotating magnetic field, a buildup of heavy alloying atoms in the rim of the samples can be achieved. One possible application of this effect would be surface hardening of aluminum alloys. Results from the binary Al-Si 7 samples are in accordance with theoretical predictions. The measured structure parameters show a distinct dependence on the solidification velocity when <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> flow during processing versus a field free solidification, as to be expected. This influence of the flow field on the sample structure can only in part be detected for the ternary Al-Si 7 -Mn 1 samples. The primary dendrite arm spacing shows a decreased effect of the flow, however secondary and tertiary arm spacings apparently remain unaffected by the TMF. The explanation given supports the assumption of a divorced symbiotic eutectic growth of dendrites and intermetallic phases. Herein, a preferred precipitation of intermetallic, manganese rich phases is predicted in the immediate vicinity of freshly grown dendrite arms. This prohibits penetration of the induced flow into the fine interdendritic regions, thus an accelerated coarsening of dendritic side arms is likewise impeded. If these results can be attested to other alloys with intermetallic primary phases, this finding represents a significant contribution towards a more precise modelling of solidification processes...|$|E
40|$|Duncan, Randall L. Bone is {{a highly}} dynamic tissue {{constantly}} adapting itself to several physical and biochemical cues. Of these various signals, application of mechanical stimulation has profound anabolic effects on maintaining the integrity and architecture of bone. While physical activity retards bone loss, the lack of physical stimuli results in significant bone loss as observed in immobilized patients and astronauts in microgravity. However, it has been ascertained that bone is habituated to continuous mechanical loading and a similar effect is witnessed at the cellular level in osteoblasts. The goal {{of the study was}} to elucidate the cellular mechanism for osteoblast desensitization to mechanical stimulation so the anabolic effects of the physical stimulus on bone can be best utilized. The osteogenic response to mechanical loading is an outcome of an intricate biophysical process. During physical activity, the strain applied on the bone causes interstitial fluid movement across the canaliculi <b>inducing</b> <b>fluid</b> shear stress (FSS) on the bone cells. These cells detect and transmit the physical stimulus to initiate a cascade of downstream signaling that eventually culminates in osteogenesis. This process of converting mechanical stimulus into biochemical response is termed mechanotransduction. Numerous components have been implicated in osteoblast mechanotransduction including the purinergic receptor, P 2 X 7 (P 2 X 7 R). In vivo studies conducted on P 2 X 7 R KO mice demonstrated that significant percent of mechanically induced bone formation is dependent on this ligand gated ion channel. Interestingly, the P 2 X 7 R were found localized in caveolae of certain cell types. Flask shaped plasmallemmal invaginations, caveolae, are subset of lipid microdomains with caveolin- 1 (CAV 1) as their primary protein constituent. Caveolae aids in several cellular functions including scaffolding proteins and endocytosis. Furthermore, it has been observed that the CAV 1 KO mice have significantly higher bone mass and strength. This led to the hypothesis that caveolae in osteoblasts scaffolds the purinergic receptor, P 2 X 7, and the loss of mechanosensitivity is due to the caveolar endocytosis of P 2 X 7 R upon ligand binding. Initial studies carried out demonstrated that CAV 1 was internalized when osteoblasts were stimulated with P 2 X 7 R agonists. Sucrose gradient fractionation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 pre-osteoblasts showed that CAV 1 translocated to the denser cytosolic fractions upon stimulation with ATP. Additionally, both ATP and the more specific P 2 X 7 R agonist, BzATP, induced endocytosis of CAV 1, which was inhibited when MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were pretreated with the specific P 2 X 7 R antagonist, A- 839977. The P 2 X 7 R co-fractionated with CAV 1 but, using Superresolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM), we found that only a sub-population of the P 2 X 7 R existed in these lipid microdomains on the membrane of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. Suppression of CAV 1 enhanced the intracellular [Ca 2 +]i to BzATP, suggesting that caveolae regulates P 2 X 7 R signaling. This proposed mechanism is supported by increased mineralization observed in CAV 1 knockdown MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells treated with BzATP. These data suggest that caveolae regulate P 2 X 7 R signaling upon activation by undergoing endocytosis and potentially carrying with it other signaling proteins, hence controlling the spatio-temporal signaling of P 2 X 7 R in osteoblasts. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the osteoblasts were desensitized to mechanical stimulus. Consecutive stimulation of the MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells with FSS failed to elicit a [Ca 2 +]i response during the 2 nd stimulation. By measuring the [Ca 2 +]i response to ATP and BzATP, it was determined that the P 2 X 7 R in osteoblasts were temporarily desensitized. While these results were encouraging, further investigation revealed caveolae has no role in the desensitization of P 2 X 7 R. The suppression of CAV 1 had no apparent effect on the loss of sensitivity of P 2 X 7 R to BzATP. Moreover there was no evidence for P 2 X 7 R endocytosis observed when the MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were treated with ATP or BzATP. Finally, we ascertained the CAV 1 KD cells were unable to retain their mechanosensitivity as postulated. These results indicated the presence of a separate mechanism that led to a different approach involving cytoskeletal reorganization. One of the prominent responses of osteoblasts in response to FSS is the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton to form stress fibers. The increase in stress fibers was found to significantly enhance the cellular stiffness in a purinergic signaling dependent manner. Although the changes in cytoskeleton were postulated to alter cellular mechanosensitivity, there have been no reports demonstrating a detailed mechanism. The purinergic receptor, P 2 Y 2 (P 2 Y 2 R) has been shown to be essential for cytoskeletal reorganization in certain cell types and interestingly the P 2 Y 2 R KO mice had enhanced bone mineral density. We hypothesized that P 2 Y 2 R induced increase in ASFF is responsible for osteoblast desensitization. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells treated with UTP, a potent agonist of P 2 Y 2 R, displayed strong ASFF. The effect was blocked when the cells were pretreated with Suramin, an antagonist of P 2 Y 2 R. Moreover, when P 2 Y 2 R was suppressed using siRNA, there was significant increase in the number of responding cells to consecutive FSS application. These data validates the hypothesis that the mechanosensitivity of osteoblasts are regulated by P 2 Y 2 R through ASFF. Overall our novel findings provide great insights into better understanding the mechanism of cellular desensitization to physical stimulation in osteoblasts. These findings can be further explored to have significant impact in mechanical load induced osteogenesis to prevent severe bone disorders such as osteoporosis.

However, thiazolidinediones <b>induce</b> <b>fluid</b> retention, edema, and sometimes precipitate or exacerbate heart failure in a subset of patients. The mechanism through which thiazolidinediones <b>induce</b> <b>fluid</b> retention is controversial. Most studies suggest that this effect results from the increase in tubular sodium and water reabsorption in the kidney, but the role of specific nephron segments and sodium carriers involved is less clear. Some studies suggested that PPARγ agonist stimulates Na+ reabsorption in the collecting duct by activating epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), either directly or through serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase- 1 (SGK- 1). However, other studies did not confirm this mechanism and even report the suppression of ENaC. Alternative mechanisms in the collecting duct include stimulation of non-ENaC sodium channel or inhibition of chloride secretion to the tubular lumen. In addition, thiazolidinediones may augment sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule by stimulating the expression and activity of apical Na+/H+ exchanger- 3 and basolateral Na+- cotransporter {{as well as of}} Na+,K+-ATPase. These effects are mediated by PPARγ-induced nongenomic transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) ...|$|R
