50|$|Connectors {{are used}} in cold-formed steel {{construction}} to attach members (i.e. studs, joists) to each other or to the primary structure {{for the purpose of}} load transfer and support. Since an assembly is only as strong as its weakest component, it is important to engineer each connection so that it meets specified performance requirements. There are two main connection types, Fixed and Movement-Allowing (Slip). Fixed connections of framing members do not allow movement of the connected parts. They can be found in axial-load bearing walls, curtain walls, trusses, roofs, and floors. Movement-Allowing connections are designed to allow deflection of the primary structure in the vertical direction due to live load, or in the horizontal direction due to wind or seismic loads, or both vertical and horizontal directions. One application for a vertical movement-allowing connection is to isolate non-axial load bearing walls (drywall) from the vertical live load of the structure and to prevent damage to finishes. A common clip for this application is an L-shaped top-of-wall clip for walls that are infill between floors. These clips have slots perpendicular to the bend in the clip. Another common clip is the bypass clip for walls that bypass outside the edge of the floor structure. When these clips are L-shaped, the have slots that are parallel to the bend in the clip. If the structure is in an active seismic zone, vertical and horizontal movement-allowing connections may be used to accommodate both the vertical deflection and <b>horizontal</b> <b>drift</b> of the structure.|$|E

""A Thesis {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. "Thesis supervisor: Dr. Neil Fox. Measuring spatial coverage of rainfall is important for several disciplines; unfortunately, rainfall data via rain gauges is very limited in spatial coverage. The best remote sensing tool available for rainfall estimation is radar, but this has many limitations, especially for locations far from the radar. Central Missouri is one such location and {{was the focus of}} this study. For this study a computer program was created to determine the effectiveness of radar rainfall estimation techniques in Central Missouri. Two groups of techniques were evaluated. The first group was conventional formulas. These were simple formulas based on combinations of three available radar parameters: reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and specific phase differential. The second group was designed specifically for this project. This group consisted of the "trace techniques", where individual raindrops were traced back to the location where they interacted with the radar beam. In this process the program used high resolution model data to calculate <b>horizontal</b> <b>drift</b> and raindrop evaporation. The results from this study indicated a modest improvement in radar rainfall estimation performance from the introduction of raindrop evaporation; this improvement was on the order of 10 %. The conclusion was made that the effects of raindrop evaporation were significant enough to warrant the inclusion of high resolution model data in the radar rainfall estimation process. Less conclusive were the effects of <b>horizontal</b> <b>drift</b> on radar rainfall estimation. Includes bibliographical references (pages 208 - 211) ...|$|E

Selected test results of a comprehensive laboratory experimental programme are presented to gain insight into the hydromechanical response of this multi-porosity compacted material. To improve the information on local transient behaviour, simulation-assisted techniques using a double-structure constitutive model are used.

40|$|The {{nature and}} causes of {{variations}} in the atmospheric electric field as measured at the earth's surface at Durham are investigated. Determinations of the horizontal velocity of travel of variations of periods less than one hour, are made from simultaneous field measurements, using two rotating electrostatic fluxmetera, at two points approximately 100 m apart. In fair weather the horizontal speed of the variations is about 1. 2 {{times that of the}} wind at 10 m, suggesting that they are due primarily to the motion of windborne space charges contained in the first 100 m of atmosphere. In general the magnitude of the field variations appears to be dependent on the vertical stability of the lower atmosphere. Certain distinctive variations are believed to originate from charged locomotive steam while others appear related to atmospheric convective motion. Measurements in mist and fog support the view that the undulatory nature of the field is due to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drift</b> of fog of varying thickness or density. Frequently fields below layer clouds show wave-like variations, these are shown to be due to the horizontal motion of cloud layers which contain a periodic spatial distribution of charges. This charge distribution appears to be closely related to visible structural variations in cloud thickness or density. Reasons are given for suggesting that, in stratus cloud, charge is separated by the Wilson process. It is shown that the field disturbances below shower clouds are due mainly to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drift</b> of the charge system associated with the cloud.
