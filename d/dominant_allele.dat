5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single <b>dominant</b> <b>allele.</b> The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
25|$|Peach and {{nectarines}} are {{the same}} species, {{even though they are}} regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); genetic studies suggest nectarines are produced due to a recessive allele, whereas peaches are produced from a <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> for fuzzy skin.|$|E

These studies imply the plants response to changing CO2 levels is largely controlled by genetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for red hair, and the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>allele,</b> and the allele that is overridden is called the recessive allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.|$|E
25|$|The progeny in {{this case}} {{received}} two dominant alleles linked on one chromosome (referred to as coupling or cis arrangement). However, after crossover, some progeny could have received one parental chromosome with a <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> for one trait (e.g. Purple) linked to a recessive allele for a second trait (e.g. round) with the opposite being true for the other parental chromosome (e.g. red and Long). This {{is referred to as}} repulsion or a trans arrangement. The phenotype here would still be purple and long but a test cross of this individual with the recessive parent would produce progeny with much greater proportion of the two crossover phenotypes. While such a problem may not seem likely from this example, unfavourable repulsion linkages do appear when breeding for disease resistance in some crops.|$|E

25|$|The CLN3 gene was {{originally}} {{identified as the}} whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen {{was inspired by a}} similar study in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a positive regulator of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild-type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a <b>dominant</b> <b>allele)</b> in fact contained a nonsense mutation that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1—renamed CLN3—and the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in budding yeast.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{different}} color genes {{exist in the}} Doberman, one for black (B) and one for color dilution (D). There are nine possible combinations of these alleles (BBDD, BBDd, BbDD, BbDd, BBdd, Bbdd, bbDD, bbDd, bbdd), which result in four {{different color}} phenotypes: black, red, blue, and fawn (Isabella). The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes {{have at least one}} <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd), and is commonly referred to as black or black and rust (also called black and tan). The red, red rust or brown coloration occurs when the black gene has two recessive alleles but the dilution gene has at least one <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). [...] "Blue" [...] and [...] "fawn" [...] are controlled by the color dilution gene. The blue Doberman has the color gene with at least one <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The fawn (Isabella) coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.|$|E

A 2009 study of naltrexone as an alcohol dependence treatment among African Americans failed to find any {{statistically significant differences between}} naltrexone and a placebo. Studies have suggested that carriers of the G allele may experience higher levels of craving and stronger [...] "high" [...] upon alcohol consumption, compared to carriers of the <b>dominant</b> <b>allele,</b> and naltrexone somewhat blunts these responses, leading to a reduction in alcohol use in some studies.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{monohybrid}} cross {{is used to}} determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the <b>dominant</b> <b>allele's</b> phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|R

2500|$|Melanism in the jaguar (Panthera onca) is conferred by a <b>dominant</b> <b>allele,</b> and in {{the leopard}} (Panthera pardus) by a {{recessive}} allele. Close examination {{of the color of}} these black cats will show that the typical markings are still present, but are hidden by the excess black pigment melanin, giving an effect similar to that of printed silk. This is called [...] "ghost striping". Melanistic and non-melanistic animals can be littermates. It is thought that melanism may confer a selective advantage under certain conditions since it is more common in regions of dense forest, where light levels are lower. Recently, preliminary studies also suggest that melanism might be linked to beneficial mutations in the immune system.|$|E
2500|$|The cream gene (CCr) is an {{incomplete}} <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> {{with a distinct}} dosage effect. The DNA sequence responsible for the cream colors is the cream allele, which is at a specific locus on the MATP gene. [...] Its general effect is to lighten the coat, skin and eye colors. When one copy of the allele is present, it dilutes [...] "red" [...] pigment to yellow or gold, with a stronger effect on the mane and tail, but does not dilute black color to any significant degree. [...] When two copies of the allele are present, both red and black pigments are affected; red hairs still become cream, and black hairs become reddish. [...] A single copy of the allele has minimal impact on eye color, but when two copies are present, a horse will be blue-eyed {{in addition to a}} light coat color.|$|E
2500|$|Gray horses {{have the}} most common [...] "white-like" [...] coat color. However, the most {{noticeable}} difference between a gray horse whose hair coat is completely white and a white horse is skin color: most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes, white horses have light, unpigmented skin. [...] The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, {{as opposed to the}} unpigmented pink skin of true white horses. [...] The skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as white markings, certain white spotting patterns or dilution genes. [...] Gray foals may be born any color, but the colored hairs of their coat become progressively silvered as they age, eventually giving mature gray horses a white or nearly-white hair coat. [...] Gray is controlled by a single <b>dominant</b> <b>allele</b> of a gene that regulates specific kinds of stem cells. [...] Gray horses are at an increased risk for melanoma; 70-80% of gray horses over the age of 15 have a melanoma tumor.|$|E
40|$|Seed coat {{color in}} soybean is {{determined}} by four alleles of the classically defined / (inhibitor) locus that controls {{the presence or absence}} as well as the spatial distribution of anthocyanin pigments in the seed coat. By analyzing spontaneous mutations of the / locus, we demonstrated that the / locus is a region of chalcone synthase (CHS) gene duplications. Paradoxically, deletions of CHS gene sequences allow higher levels of CHS mRNAs and restore pigmentation to the seed coat. The unusual nature of the / locus suggests that its dominant alleles may represent naturally occurring examples of homology-dependent gene silencing and that the spontaneous deletions erase the gene-silencing phenomena. Specifically, mutations from the <b>dominant</b> ii <b>allele</b> (yellow seed coats with pigmented hila) to the recessive i allele (fully pigmented) can be associated with the absence of a 2. 3 -kb Hindlll fragment that carries CHS 4, a member of the multigene CHS family. Seven independent mutations exhibit deletions in the CHS 4 promoter region. The <b>dominant</b> / <b>allele</b> (yellow seed coats) exhibits an extra 12. 1 -kb Hindlll fragment that hybridizes with both the CHS coding region and CHS 1 promoter-specific probes. Mutations of the <b>dominant</b> / <b>allele</b> to the recessive i allele (pigmented seed coats) give rise to 10. 4 - or 9. 6 -kb Hindlll CHS fragments that have lost the duplicated CHS 1 promoter. Finally, gene expression analysis demonstrated that heterozygous plants (I/i) with yellow seed coats have reduced mRNA levels, indicating that the 12. 1 -kb Hindlll CHS fragment associated with the <b>dominant</b> / <b>allele</b> inhibits pigmentation in a trans-dominant manner. Moreover, CHS gene-specific expression in seed coats shows that multiple CHS genes are expressed in seed coats...|$|R
50|$|One {{phenotype}} (brown/blonde) has a <b>dominant</b> brown <b>allele</b> and a recessive blond allele. A {{person with}} a brown allele will have brown hair; a person with no brown alleles will be blond. This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child. However, this can only be possible if both parent are heterozygous in hair color- meaning {{that both of them}} have one <b>dominant</b> brown hair <b>allele</b> and one recessive allele for blond hair, but as dominant traits mask recessive ones the parents both have brown hair.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} protein {{function}} mostly relies on perturbing regulatory networks by acting upon protein expression levels or using transdominant negative agents.
