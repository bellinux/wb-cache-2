40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, the <b>greater</b> <b>silver</b> <b>smelt</b> Argentina silus and the roundnose {{grenadier}} Coryphaenoides rupestris, are highly {{abundant in the}} deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small aimed trawl fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the <b>greater</b> <b>silver</b> <b>smelt,</b> abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a European Union (UE) contract and with voluntary participation of commercial fishing vessels, a discard sampling programme based on stratified random sampling by fisheries covered the activities of trawl and long line Spanish fleets fishing in ICES Subarea VII in 1994. Discards of commercial and non-commercial species, including species of pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, caught incidentally were estimated in kg per fishing hour by ICES rectangle and depth stratum in 1994. The sampling programme was carried out by observers on board commercial fishing vessels during normal fishing activity. A total of 238 species caught by trawlers and 76 by long liners were determined. The comparison of the two fleets regarding their ratios of discards in 1994 shows that the larger percentages of discards relative to total catches are found in the trawl fisheries (48 %) and around 50 % are primarily due to the discards of three species of fish and one of crustacea. Seasonal variation in the case of discards of the two main species (<b>Great</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Smelt</b> and Horse Mackerei) was observed. The depth at which discards were hig lies between 200 and 400 m. Conversely, long line fishing in Subarea VII shows a lower discard rate than that of trawlers (10 %). Approximately 60 % of discards primarily comprise two species of fish, Blue Whiting and <b>Great</b> <b>Silver</b> <b>Smelt,</b> both of which show the highest discard value per f. h. in the 3 rd quarter. No differences were observed by depth strata...|$|R

40|$|The WKAMDEEP met at IMEDEA (UIB/CSIC) in Esporles, Spain from 21 to 25 Octo-ber 2013 {{to review}} age {{determination}} methods and growth patterns of several deep-water fish species {{in order to}} pave the way for solid input data of future age-based assessments for these species. The species dealt with by the Group were: tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), <b>greater</b> <b>silver</b> <b>smelt</b> (Argentina silus), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and black-spotted sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo). All relevant information was collated in species-specific annexes, in order to have a protocol which was easy to consult and use for each species. The main report sums up the discussions in the group and presents results from the small WebGr-exchanges of each species made prior to and during the meeting.

40|$|The coastal banks from Møre to Lofoten were {{surveyed}} with R. V. «Johan Hjort» {{during the period}} I — 11 March 1972. The primary aim of the survey was by means of echo sounding and trawling to obtain information about the spawning grounds of saithe. Dense concentrations of saithe were found twice during the survey: In the area Sørmannsneset — Skateneset — Steinmaren off Møre and on {{the northern part of}} the Halten Bank. Samples from trawl hauls indicated that the saithe were in the process of spawning in both areas. These two areas appear to be the most important spawning grounds of saithe within the surveyed area. The trawl catches of saithe were dominated by the 1964 and 1965 year classes. The year classes 1962 and 1966 were also abundant. Concentrations of smaller demersal fish were observed during most of the survey. Norway pout was the most common species off Møre, but was apparently replaced further north by <b>greater</b> <b>silver</b> <b>smelt,</b> redfish (Sebastes viviparus), and silvery cod.

Inside the Trondheimsfjord, within a 400 to 500 m deep basin, about 340 kg was taken per half-hour-tow using a bottom prawn trawl. Around 500 kg per half-hour was taken in a 400 - 530 m deep basin in the Flatanger-Folla area, while catches above 3060 kg per half-hour were taken in a 350 m deep basin in the inner part of Foldenfjorden. Only few specimens were taken by use of pelagic trawl. In the deeper basins outside the near coastal areas, the catch rates were found too small for commercial fishing.

The EU introduced TAC management in 2003. For 2013 the EU TAC was set to 4316 tons in area V, VI, VII. For 2014 and 2016 the EU TAC was set to the same as in 2013 (V, VI, VII = 4316 tons). Most, if not all, of theEU TAC is caught in ICES Division VIa, therefore from the Vb–VIa stock unit. The fishery is smaller in other areas where the species is also discarded by various fisheries in quantities that could not be estimated. Little new data and no new assessment were presented for orange roughy in 2015. The species appears is very small amount in discards of some fleets in EU waters. There is a Faroese fishery on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For this particularly long-lived species, the results Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) presented in 2013 re-main appropriate and do no need yearly updating. The status of the roundnose grenadier stocks are varied. Roundnose grenadier in Vb, VI, VII and XIIb is assessed using a Bayesian surplus production model since 2010. The fishing pressure in recent years is estimated low, the biomass is slowly rebuild-ing after two decades of overexploitation. No advice is required in 2015. Exploratory assessments were carried out using the abundance indices from the Marine Scotland Deepwater Science Survey instead of the usual French tallybook indices (which was also run for comparison between models). Estimated trends in stock biomass using the survey of the tallybook indices are consistent. However, the stock biomass in re-cent years is estimated to increase at a substantially higher rate when the model is fit to the survey index. The survey covers the main distribution range of thee stock and the main fishing grounds. It is therefore most likely to provide a realistic index of the stock abundance. It may further be conservative as it does not cover the fully area of distribution part of which has not been fished in recent years. WGDEEP proposed the stock for benchmarking in 2017, in order to review the use of biomass indices and investigate alternative to the current assessment model. The fishery for roundnose grenadier in Division IIIa has been stopped since 2006 and landings are now insignificant. The bycatch from other fisheries is also low. The only information to assess this stock is now a Norwegian survey index from the same area. This index has shown a declining trend since 2006 and is now at the lowest level rec-orded during the time-series from 1984. The state of roundnose grenadier stocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is unclear owing to limited data. This stock was intensively exploited in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the fishery declined in the 1990 s and was insignifi-cant in the 2000 s and resumed in 2011. In other areas, roundnose grenadier is only a bycatch and catch are insignificant. An assessment and advice was requested for the roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) in the Northeast Atlantic owing to landings reported in previous years. Data were compiled and a catch based advice was prepared. This species is caught and subject to TAC management in the NAFO area. In the ICES area, it occurs at a much lower level, it is however known to occur at east Greenland (Division XIVb, Iceland (Va), Faroe Islands (Vb), Northern North Sea (IVa), Norwegian and Barents Sea (I and II). The landings level reported in some previous years were not plausible as high densities are not known to occur in reported catch areas. An advice reflecting possi-ble level of sustainable catch was prepared. Similarly, an assessment and advice was requested for the roundsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) in the Northeast Atlantic (see chapter 15). This species is con-sidered to have none or only minor commercial interest. The request for an advice came from landings reported in previous years. These landings were considered to be either minor bycatch or species misreporting. The advice is that the possible small landings of the species are counted against existing roundnose and roughhead gren-adiers TACs. The assessment of black scabbardfish was benchmarked at WKDEEP 2014. This spe-cies was formerly assessed in three units in the ICES area. Although no final conclu-sion is reached all available evidence suggest that a single stock does a large clockwise migrations in the Northeast Atlantic and further south in the CECAF areas where spawning occurs. Whether fish in Azorean waters and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES Subareas X and XII) belongs to the same widely distributed stock is un-certain and the picture in Subarea X is further blurred by the mixing with the closely related intermediate scabbardfish (Aphanopus intermedius). Greater forkbeard is caught mostly as a bycatch. Adults are a landed bycatch in slope fisheries for hake, monkfish, megrims and deep-water species and juveniles are a discarded bycatch in numerous fisheries. The assessment is based upon indices from four surveys. The increasing trend in abundance and biomass in recent years seems to be reverting. Time-series of survey indices display pluri-annual fluctuations, prob-ably related to recruitment variability. Alfonsinos are a mixture of two species (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus. These species are oceanic demersal species occurring at the top of seamounts and along slopes, where they form local aggregations. They are widespread in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland to the Azores and along the continental slope, in particular to the west of Iberia and Bay of Biscay. The stock structure is uncertain and data very limited. Although a longline survey is carried out in the Azores, where most of the catch occur, the reliably of survey indices is uncertain for these species owing to their large and patchy spatial distributions. As a consequence, the perception of the status of these stocks relies primarily on catch trends. Three stocks of blackspot sea bream are assessed by WGDEEP. In ICES Subarea IX Target fishery only take places in the Strait of Gibraltar, while the species is taken as a bycatch of artisanal fleets which uses mainly longlines. In 2014, landings and lpue from the Spanish “voracera” target fishery seemed increasing and the mean length in the catchwas slightly larger. However, the VMS-based lpue developed in recent years could not be updated and the assessment this stock is undermined by the lack of data from the Mediterranean and CECAF area as the same stockstraddles over ICES, CE-CAF and GFCM areas, where management regimes are different. Although no advice is given in 2015 for blackspot sea bream stocks, the WGDEEP report reminds that a recovery plan involving all parties is necessary for this stock. The stock of the same species in the Azores (ICES Subarea X) also showed signs of overexploitation. Ex-ploratory analyses of the natural and fishing mortalities were conducted using catch curves in order to investigate optimal exploitation reference points (yield-per-recruit analysis). Results show that modelling the fraction of population that change sex is a key issue to better estimating the trajectory of the spawning biomass. Data collection on sex ratio, maturity and sex change has been updated and analysed. Traditional models should be extended to incorporate the sex change issue. The third blackspot sea bream stock in ICES Subareas VI, VII and VIII remains at a low level, since it col-lapsed in the 1980 s. In response to a request from the NEAFC, the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the NEAFC and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local deple-tionat the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES subarea and division (Chapter 15) ...|$|E

In 1837, {{by the age of}} 22, he became independent and moved to the city of Copiapó, with a small capital he had managed to save.|$|R
5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe {{and across the}} Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes. Like their predecessors, the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of <b>silver</b> <b>smelting.</b> Lead mining occurred in Central Europe, Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world production.|$|R
50|$|A German silver smelter and adventurer Burchard Kranich ran a <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> house between 1556 and 1583. The house cost £300 {{to build}} and to fund the house he {{borrowed}} money from Mary Tudor, William Godolphin and several others. The mill, used for crushing ore, had a leat of 2000 paces, and the melting house, for refining the silver, was sited at what is now Fen Cottage and Fen Field {{which used to be}} known as Fining. At least 2,000 ounces of <b>silver</b> were <b>smelted</b> with ore coming from mines in Tregadoke, Padstow, St Delion, Portysyke, Peran and St Columb. In 1573 Queen Elizabeth ordered that a rate be levied for rebuilding the bridge in to aid production of silver.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} mining in the Straßberg Field {{since at least}} 1438, and {{possibly}} even as early as 1279. The first <b>silver</b> <b>smelting</b> works are recorded in the period from 1511-1566. The first water management facilities in the Rödelbach valley also date to this time. By {{the second half of}} the 16th century the ore deposits near the surface were exhausted and mining largely ground to a standstill. During the Thirty Years' War mining operations ceased completely.|$|R
5000|$|HB Grandi’s freezer {{trawlers}} {{are large}} and well equipped vessels that catch and produce Greenland halibut, redfish, cod, haddock, saithe, <b>silver</b> <b>smelt</b> and mackerel as well as various other species. The catch is processed {{as soon as it}} comes on board and each species goes through a specific process to ensure quality; size-graded, whole frozen, filleted, IQF or headed and gutted [...] The result is a great quality product from the pristine and unpolluted sea around Iceland. In 2013 HB Grandi’s five freezer trawlers caught a total of 33.500 tons.|$|R
40|$|Samples of <b>silver</b> <b>smelt,</b> as fillets from frozen fish, as block-frozen fillet and as block-frozen mince, were thawed {{and tested}} for {{toughness}} (by shearing) and water-binding capacity after storage at - 28 C for 150, 235 and 374 days; cryoprotectants were not used. Shear values {{fell over the}} storage period for fillets from frozen fish but remained relatively constant for the other two types of frozen material. Block-frozen fillets had the highest shear values. The water-binding capacities were lowest for block-frozen mince and decreased steadily over the three test dates for {{the three types of}} material...|$|R
