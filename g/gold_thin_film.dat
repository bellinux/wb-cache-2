The fabrication of the black <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> was achieved by a thermal evaporation technique in N 2 atmosphere. Different evaporation conditions were attempted to optimize the absorbance of the black gold coating, especially the atmosphere pressure and the mass of evaporation source. The long-standing problem of black gold’s adhesion with the substrate was solved by fuming 502 superglues into the black gold layer, which had almost no impact on the absorbance performance.

In this paper, silicon substrates were bonded using <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> Experimental data on {{the effects}} of bonding pressure (30 to 120 MPa), temperature (260 and 300 /spl deg/C), and time (2 to 90 min) on the bond toughness, measured using the four-point bend technique, are presented. In general, higher temperature and pressure lead to higher toughness bonds. Considerable variation in toughness was observed across specimens. Possible causes of the nonuniform bond quality were explored using finite element analysis.

To improve the adhesion of thermally evaporated <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> we introduce a gold deposition step on SU- 8 photoresist prior to UV exposure but after the pre-bake step of SU- 8 processing. Shrinkage and distribution of residual stresses, which occur during cross-linking of the SU- 8 polymer layer in the post-exposure baking step, {{are responsible for the}} higher adhesion of the top gold film to the post-deposition cured SU- 8 sublayer.

40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) is a {{rapid and}} sensitive technique used for probing the biomolecular interactions in real time. Several new approaches {{have been suggested}} to improve the sensitivity of SPR sensors {{over the last two}} decades. Most of them are based on creating or patterning nanostructures/nanomaterials in order to enhance the sensitivity. Graphene offers several advantages due to its special optical and structural properties. Herein, we propose a new angular interrogated dual wavelength based differential detection approach for graphene based SPR sensing to increase the sensitivity. Reflectivity of the p-polarized incident light has been calculated using the N-layer model for the most common Kretschmann configuration. Sensitivity of the SPR with and without graphene layers has been calculated for single and dual wavelength based approaches. Computational results show that the proposed graphene SPR sensor has (1 + 0. 4 L) η times higher sensitivity than the conventional <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> based SPR sensors. Further, increasing the number of graphene layers, L, improves the sensitivity. Where, η represents the enhanced sensitivity due to increased binding/adsorption of biomolecules on graphene over a <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for a refractive index (Δn) = 0. 005 with L = 1 to 10...|$|E

Granularity and freezing of spin-orbit scattering inside the grains explains the suppression of spin-orbit scattering.

40|$|A {{particular}} interesting plasmonic {{system is}} that of metallic nanostructures interacting with metal films. As the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanostructures (Au NPs) {{on the top of}} a <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> is exquisitely sensitive to the spacer distance of the film-Au NPs, we investigate in the present work the influence of a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs. The idea is to evidence the role of few-layered graphene as one of the thinnest possible spacer. We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong lowering at around 507 nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs. Moreover, a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in the presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where gold nanostructures are directly linked to a <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> Numerical simulations suggest that this LSP mode is dipolar and that the hot spots of the electric field are pushed to the top corners of the NPs, which makes it very sensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for sensing applications. A figure of merit of such a system (gold/graphene/Au NPs) is 2. 8, as compared to 2. 1 for gold/Au NPs. This represents a 33 % gain in sensitivity and opens-up new sensing strategies...|$|E

We found that remote H(2) plasma pretreatments of gold surfaces are effective in improving thiolate adsorption, making SAMs more uniform and densely packed. We also demonstrate that hydrogenation of nanoparticles improves stability of thiol functionalized Au NPs, avoiding their aggregation. Additionally, we demonstrate that a remote H(2) plasma processing is also effective in the selective removal of the carbon chain and of sulfur atoms from gold surfaces, therefore allowing tailoring of their optical and chemical properties...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} of a <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> irradiated by ultrashort pulses is studied using molecular-dynamics simulations, {{and compared}} with that of a bulk target. A film thickness comparable to the ballistic electron depth in gold (≈ 100 nm) is considered, evidencing a significant change of the temperature spatial profile inside the target material, which eventually influences the material decomposition. Particular emphasis is given to the process of nanoparticle generation. The simulations indicate a more uniform heating of the sample {{in the case of the}} thin film, which is accompanied by a more homogeneous size distribution of the nanoparticles produced in the ablation process. An experimental characterization of the ultrashort-pulse ablation process is also carried out. The produced nanoparticles are collected on suitable substrates, and atomic force microscopy analysis of less than one layer deposits is performed. An ≈ 2 × narrowing of the nanoparticles equivalent to spherical diameter size distribution is observed in the case of ablation of the <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film,</b> in fairly good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Moreover, interesting changes of the nanoparticle shape are evidenced, which are correlated to the changes in the nanoparticle ablation plume dynamics, as studied by time-gated imaging of its self-emission.

40|$|International audienceIn [1] we {{presented}} a new length extension mode (LEM) piezoelectric micro-resonator. Thanks {{to a specific}} design, anchor losses were lowered to maximize the Q. f product and the resonator. Viscous fluid damping is neglected since the resonator is under vacuum {{and so is the}} thermoelastic damping for a length extension mode. With a Q predicted over one million the resonator is well suited for MEMS oscillator devices. Nevertheless it appears that one remaining loss source was not evaluated through our previous work: the viscoelastic damping arising from the presence of gold electrodes on the resonator surface. To investigate the influence of the <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> on this new resonator, we studied several papers on the quality factor of gold coated resonators and deduced a frequency dependence of the viscoelastic behavior of the <b>gold</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> This dependence shows that the damping for the LEM resonator won't be as important as firstly predicted and is compliant for time and frequency applications. Furthermore, the damping can be reduced to improve the quality factor with new electrode designs. These designs shall also provide low motional resistances in order not to deteriorate the phase noise far from the carrier. Two different approaches are compared to reduce electrode damping for the LEM resonator: contactless electrodes and partial electrode coating on the resonator surface.
