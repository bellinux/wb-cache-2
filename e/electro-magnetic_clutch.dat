50|$|For 1990, Ford {{introduced}} an electronically-controlled four-wheel drive system {{as an option}} for the Aerostar. Called E-4WD (Electronic 4-Wheel Drive), the system was specifically an all-wheel drive system. Using a Dana TC28 transfer case with a center differential (regulated by an electronically controlled <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutch),</b> all four wheels were given traction at all times. The system shifted traction to the front wheels as it detected rear wheel spin, with no driver input required. As E-4WD was not intended for off-road driving, the Aerostar was not provided with specific low-range gearing.|$|E
50|$|The engine has a {{water cooling}} {{system with a}} {{centrifugal}} pump, which is driven from the crankshaft with a belt; it runs always. A thermostat controls the water amount. Starting at 80 °C the water is pumped into the water cooler, before this temperature level, it circulates in the engine block only to increase the engine temperature fast. The engine fan runs always, except from later versions of the engine which have a fan with an <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutch,</b> which is activated at 92 °C by a temperature sensor.|$|E

25|$|Archers {{powerplant}} {{continued to}} give trouble, particularly the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutches.</b> If the clutch disengaged the engines would race at high revs {{and had to}} be shut down in order for repairs to be made. This was particularly problematic if aircraft were flying or there were enemy submarines nearby. On 26 June, Archer departed Freetown bound for Bermuda, where she was to undergo repairs. Work started on 15 July and took some fourteen weeks to complete. Archer then sailed to New York City where she joined Convoy UGS 2 which departed New York on 2 November bound for Casablanca, Morocco. She ferried 30 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and US personnel to Casablanca. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join convoy MKF 3 which departed Gibraltar on 27 November. When Archer arrived in the UK, she was sent to Liverpool for another refit which commenced on 4 December. Her flight deck was lengthened at this refit.|$|R
40|$|Thi paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} active vibration control for passing through critical speeds of a rotating shaft using electro-magnetic clutches. In this method the vibration of the shaft due to whirling is controlled by means of on and off electric current controls of the electro-magnetic clutches which support the shaft under the on control, The principle of this method {{is to change the}} eigen-frequencies of the shaft by adding or losing the supports during shaft rotation. To verify the present method, this paper provides a model of a rotating shaft system with an <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutch,</b> and examines the results analytically and experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Conventional {{transmission}} system uses {{single plate clutch}} with a manual transmission gear box. Disengage clutch, Change gear, Gradually engage clutch thus three operations are to be performed while moving from one gear to another, hence in all 15 operations are performed {{to move to the}} top gear, {{it is important to note}} out of the 15 operations performed to reach the top gear… 10 operations are clutch operations, hence making clutch operations automatic will reduce human effort. Automatic clutch control has another advantage, i. e, out of three pedals ie, one of accelerator pedal, Brake Pedal, Clutch pedal eliminating the clutch pedal will lead to easy driving as the controls become simple. Many methods of automatic clutch control namely <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutch,</b> pneumatic clutch control etc have been tried but due inherent disadvantages and maintenance problems they have been replaced back by conventional method. The auto-disengagement single clutch employs only one set of compression springs instead of the usual two sets, with this arrangement it is possible to reduce the weights of the centrifugal members. The modified system utilizes the centrifugal force developed by engine acceleration, whereas the temporary dis-engagement of clutch required at the time of gear change is a solenoid actuated by switch in gear change knob. The hold time of the solenoid is only a few seconds thus prolongs solenoid life and reduces power consumption from battery...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to analyse the {{physical}} properties of the systemic arterial circulation by a standard engineering approach (transient analysis). This involved giving a square wave infusion of blood and interpretation of the pressure response. Development of a technique to give a square wave infusion of blood was required. This resulted in an infusion-giving apparatus which was composed essentially of a syringe whose action was controlled by a large, servo-controlled motor. The square wave effect was achieved by an electro-magnetic clutch-brake combination. The latter was capable of full activation within a 30 millisecond time interval. The whole apparatus was able to give a perfect square wave within the tolerance of these limits. Approximately 5 % of the animals blood volume was slowly withdrawn into the infusion giving apparatus through a cannula in the right carotid artery. On activation of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>clutch,</b> this blood was returned to the rabbit {{in the form of a}} square wave over a 2 - 3 second period. During this period, the heart was transiently arrested by vagus nerve stimulation. The pressure response of the arterial system to this square wave infusion of known flow rate was monitored in the right femoral artery with a pressure transducer. By relating the input flow pattern to the output pressure response, information could be obtained about the physical properties of the system. Direct pressure-flow studies across the whole systemic arterial circulation were found to be linear in the range of 90 to 40 mm Hg pressure. A 'critical closing pressure' was invariably present, and found to vary in value from 10 to 50 mm Hg. This necessitated a modification in the normal method of calculating total peripheral resistance to account for the true slope of the pressure-flow plot (herein called 'slope' resistance). It was found that the mean chord resistance value in a 5 to 6 lb. rabbit was approximately twice the magnitude of the mean slope resistance value (0. 33 to 0. 17 mm Hg/ml/min). Furthermore, these did not always vary in the same direction when a variety of different stresses were imposed on the circulation. Compliance value calculations demonstrated a hysteresis effect. The mean compliance value of the systemic arterial circulation in a 5 - 6 lb. rabbit measured during inflation was 0. 037 ml/mm Hg: measured during deflation, it was 0. 054 ml/mm Hg. There was good correlation between the compliance values measured by the square wave infusion method and by a method using excised lengths of aorta. An inertial component was found to be present which had an approximate mean value of 30 gm cm- 4 in 5 - 6 lb. rabbits. The general response of the systemic arterial circulation to square wave infusion showed that it could primarily be considered to act as a linear first order system. The transient pressure response to a step function in flow was a single exponential curve with a mean of 509 msecs in inflation and 743 msecs in deflation. More exact modelling required consideration of the systemic arterial circulation as a third order system to account for the small inertial component. An electrical model was built whose response to a simulated square wave infusion of fluid, gave good correspondence to that obtained in the living rabbit. The correlation coefficient between cardiac output values measured by the square wave infusion technique and by the Fick method was + 0. 80. The effects of various CO 2 concentrations, asphyxia, haemorrhage, nor-adrenalin infusion, and long-term cholesterol feeding on the rabbit systemic arterial circulation were investigated by this method...|$|E
