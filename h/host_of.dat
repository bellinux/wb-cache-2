40|$|During {{a survey}} of the {{nematodes}} associated with weeds in banana fields in Martinique, 41 weed species in 37 genera from 20 plant families were collected to extract nematodes from the roots. Results of this survey showed that 24 weed species were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Radopholus similis, 23 were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Helicotylenchus spp., 13 were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Pratylenchus spp., 13 were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Hoplolaimus seinhorsti, 29 were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Meloidogyne spp. and 24 were <b>hosts</b> <b>of</b> Rotylenchulus reniformis. The presence of the burrowing nematode was more consistently found within three families, the Euphorbiaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. In some weed species such as Caladium bicolor, Commelina diffusa, Echinochloa colona and Phenax sonneratii, the levels of nematodes recovered were similar to, or greater than the numbers recovered from Musa roots. These results clearly show that certain weeds can be significant reservoirs of plant parasitic nematodes including R. similis in banana fields. This information is crucial in devising appropriate nematode control measures for use with rotation crops or fallow before re-planting banana fields with nematode free planting material.
