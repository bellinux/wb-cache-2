50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard</b> is {{a system}} in which gold coins do not circulate, but the {{authorities}} agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>Gold</b> <b>Bullion</b> <b>Standard,</b> {{citizens}} of Britain and other European countries could only redeem their banknotes in large gold bars. Such bars were unsuitable for day-to-day transactions, but largely achieved {{the goal of}} keeping the gold in the vaults.|$|E
50|$|Coins {{were issued}} in {{denominations}} of 1 santīms, 2 and 5 santīmi, 10, 20 and 50 santīmu, 1 lats and 2 lati. Besides standard coins {{in the list}} below and coins for collectors, {{there were a number}} of coins that were issued only once and were rarely found in circulation - three commemorative circulation coins in denominations of 2, 10 and 100 latu (the later two of which were, respectively, silver and gold), a 100 lats <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> coin, a <b>standard</b> issue 2 lats coin that was gradually taken out of circulation starting from 1999 due to safety issues and a series of limited design 1 lats coins that were issued twice a year from 2004 to 2013, and once in 2001 and 2003. The standard coins were designed by Gunārs Lūsis and Jānis Strupulis.|$|R

5000|$|Attempts {{were made}} in the interwar period to restore the gold standard. The British Gold Standard Act reintroduced the <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard</b> in 1925, {{followed}} by many other countries. This led to relative stability, followed by deflation, but because the onset of the Great Depression and other factors, global trade greatly declined and the gold standard fell. Speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain entirely off the gold standard in 1931.|$|E
5000|$|The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both {{introduced}} the <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard</b> and simultaneously repealed the gold specie standard. The new standard ended {{the circulation of}} gold specie coins. Instead, the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price, but [...] "only {{in the form of}} bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy kg of fine gold". John Maynard Keynes, citing deflationary dangers, argued against resumption of the gold standard.|$|E
5000|$|This partial {{return to}} the Gold Standard was done by {{permitting}} central banks to keep part of their reserves in currencies that were themselves directly exchangeable for gold coins. However, citizens under this new Gold Exchange Standard (also known as the <b>Gold</b> <b>Bullion</b> <b>Standard</b> or the Inter-war Gold Standard) would not receive gold coins of the realm {{in exchange for their}} notes, though this had been {{an integral part of the}} original Gold Standard now known as the Gold Coin Standard.|$|E

5000|$|International <b>Gold</b> <b>Bullion</b> Exchange {{was founded}} in 1979 by {{brothers}} William and James Alderdice. It grew to be reportedly the largest retail <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> dealer in the United States. [...] It offered sale and storage of <b>gold</b> and silver <b>bullion</b> and coins. The company would sell <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> at a discount if the buyer agreed to postpone taking delivery. It was headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, with offices in Los Angeles and Dallas and employed over 1000 people. The company advertised in national publications like the Wall Street Journal and Barron's.|$|R
50|$|Australia {{returned}} to the gold standard in 1925 {{in conjunction with the}} United Kingdom and South Africa. As {{in the case of the}} United Kingdom, there was no return to a gold specie standard, but rather the introduction of a <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard.</b> This once again formally locked the pound in Australia to parity with the pound in the United Kingdom. During the period between 1914 and 1925, the telegraphic money transfers between London and Australia had deviated somewhat from parity, but at that time, it was merely seen as a temporary hitch due to the emergency and the suspension of the gold standard. Nobody considered the Australian pound as such to be a separate currency from sterling. However, in 1929 the Great Depression occurred, and the raw producing nations in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand were the first to feel the effects. The Australian banks that controlled the exchanges with London began to sell the Australian unit at a discount in order to increase the competitiveness of their exports to London. The gold standard in Australia was simultaneously abandoned and the Australian pound was now at a 25% discount to the pound sterling.|$|E
50|$|After the {{introduction}} in the United Kingdom of the Gold Standard Act 1925, which established a new procedure for buy-sell operations with gold, the gold coins issued after 1914 {{ceased to be}} accepted by the Bank of England. As a result, interest in the Soviet chervonets in Europe fell sharply. To obtain much-needed foreign currency, the Soviet Government decided to strike 10 ruble coins in the pre-revolutionary design, bearing the portrait of the murdered tsar Nicholas II. These coins were accepted without problems. 600,000 gold 10 ruble coins were struck in 1925 from the old dies which had survived the 1917 Revolution and the subsequent civil war. These coins were dated 1911. The following year, 1926, the government minted a further 1,411,000 of the same coins, as well as 1,000,000 gold 5 ruble coins dated 1898 on the reverse and again with the portrait of Nicolas II on the obverse. The transition of the European currency system {{in the second half of}} the 1920s to a <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard</b> led to a minimum volume requirement of 400 troy ounces for inter-bank gold deals. This resulted in the increased use of bullion bars and rendered it pointless to mint precious metal coins for international payments. A part of residual coins with the tsar portrait was used by Soviet intelligence agents in secret operations abroad.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Australia, in the {{critical}} period between 1914 and the Great depression, New Zealand did not have anything that corresponded to a central bank or a monetary authority. New Zealand's link to the pound sterling was purely through the Gold Specie Standard, and when the Gold Specie Standard was suspended at {{the outbreak of the}} first world war, the linkage was based on nothing other than existing practice. The banks controlled telegraphic transfers between New Zealand and London, and so the exchange rate was entirely in their hands. New Zealand was now effectively on a sterling exchange standard, controlled by the largely Australian trading banks, and this sterling exchange standard became a gold exchange standard for the period between 1925 and 1931 when the United Kingdom was on a <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard.</b> It wasn't however until the Great depression that the Australian banks created any substantial divergence from the traditional one-to-one parity between the London pound and the New Zealand pound. Australian and New Zealand raw exports to London were badly hit by the depression, and in an attempt to sustain demand, the Australian banks decided to sell the New Zealand pound at a 9% discount, taking the exchange rate to 110 New Zealand pounds to 100 pounds sterling by 1931. As this was new territory in the history of money, the situation became somewhat confused because a state of affairs now existed in which the exchange rate as between Australia and New Zealand was at par and did not correspond to their respective exchange rates with London. By 1933 the situation had settled to a state of affairs in which the New Zealand pound and the Australian pound were both at a 20% discount with respect to the London pound, taking the exchange rate to New Zealand 125 pounds equaling 100 pounds sterling. New Zealand joined the sterling area in 1939 at the outbreak of the second world war and in 1948, the New Zealand pound once again returned to parity with the pound sterling.|$|E

40|$|HIGH-POWERED MONEY {{as defined}} here—bank {{reserves}} and currency {{held by the}} public—is ultimately {{under the control of}} governments, which have authority to alter the conditions of issue and to change the quantity outstanding. Statutory regulations concerning money therefore {{play an important role in}} the monetary histories of most countries and in particular of the United States. This country had an inconvertible paper standard from the Civil War until 1879. It was on the gold standard from then until 1933, except for an embargo on gold exports during World War I. Since 1934 it has had the so-called <b>gold</b> <b>bullion</b> <b>standard,</b> which—because of the huge gold stock ac-cumulated in excess of statutory requirements during the 1920 's and 1930 's—until the late l 950 's allowed the government much of the freedom of an inconvertible standard. Those regulations account for much of the behavior of high-powered money in this country, though they do not alone explain the timing and amplitude of many variation...|$|E
