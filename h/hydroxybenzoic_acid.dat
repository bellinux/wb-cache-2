The effects of fruit zone leaf removal on the concentration of hydroxycinnamic, <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> and organic <b>acids</b> of cv.

Control treatment without leaf removal was also included. At veraison two intensities of leaf removal were applied. Phenolic and organic acids were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Juice samples from the grapes treated at the stages before blooming and berry set had the lowest concentrations of tartaric acid and the highest concentrations of malic acid, while juices from veraison stage treatments had the lowest concentrations of malic acid and the highest concentrations of tartaric acid.

Phenolic compounds were analysed by separating them into four main fractions: fraction I obtained by means of a liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate and fractions II, III and IV obtained by elution on a Sephadex LH- 20 column. Fraction I revealed the presence of gallic acid, gallocatechin, procyanidin 132 and epigallocatechin. Other phenolic compounds such as hydroxycinnamic and <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives, rutin and/or myricetin derivatives were also present in fraction I. Fraction II was mainly composed of epicatechin, hydroxycinnamic and <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives. Fraction III presented mainly anthocyaDins for the purple coloured mashua tubers and rutin, hydroxycinnamic acid and <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives for the yellow coloured genotype.

Title of diploma thesis: Iron - {{chelating}} {{effects of}} flavonoid metabolites - small polyphenolic substances (2015 / 2016) Iron is a trace element which {{is necessary for}} function of an organism. There is no specific excretion mechanism for iron, therefore any deflection causes deficiency or abundance. Iron abundance leads to hemochromatosis. An application of iron chelators is a treatment of choice for hemochromatosis. There are three clinically used chelators for treatment of iron overload: deferoxamine, deferasirox and deferiprone. These drugs are inappropriate for therapy (side effects, dosage form). Therefore {{there is a place}} for serching for new types of medicine for treatment of hemochromatosis. Flavonoids are natural substances with positive influence on a human organism. The most investigated effects are antioxidant and chelating activity. As flavonoids are metabolised in a human body, there is an arising question if flavonoid metabolites are also able to chelate iron ions.

40|$|AbstractAnti-hyperglycaemic {{effects of}} the <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{salicylate}} might stem from {{effects of the}} drug on mitochondrial uncoupling, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, and inhibition of NF-κB signalling. Here, we have gauged the contribution of these effects to control of hepatocyte glucose production, comparing salicylate with inactive <b>hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> analogues of the drug. In rat H 4 IIE hepatoma cells, salicylate was the only drug tested that activated AMPK. Salicylate also reduced mTOR signalling, but this property was observed widely among the analogues. In a sub-panel of analogues, salicylate alone reduced promoter activity of the key gluconeogenic enzyme glucose 6 -phosphatase and suppressed basal glucose production in mouse primary hepatocytes. Both salicylate and 2, 6 dihydroxybenzoic acid suppressed TNFα-induced IκB degradation, and in genetic knockout experiments, {{we found that the}} effect of salicylate on IκB degradation was AMPK-independent. Previous data also identified AMPK-independent regulation of glucose but we found that direct inhibition of neither NF-κB nor mTOR signalling suppressed glucose production, suggesting that other factors besides these cell signalling pathways may need to be considered to account for this response to salicylate. We found, for example, that H 4 IIE cells were exquisitely sensitive to uncoupling with modest doses of salicylate, which occurred on a similar time course to another anti-hyperglycaemic uncoupling agent 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, while there was no discernible effect at all of two salicylate analogues which are not anti-hyperglycaemic. This finding supports much earlier literature suggesting that salicylates exert anti-hyperglycaemic effects at least in part through uncoupling...|$|E
