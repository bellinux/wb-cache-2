25|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern: mutated {{copies of the}} gene GCDH must be provided by both parents to cause glutaric acidemia type 1. The GCDH gene encodes the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in degrading the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Mutations in the GCDH gene prevent production of the enzyme or result {{in the production of}} a defective enzyme with very low residual activity, or an enzyme with relatively high residual activity but still phenotypic consequences. This enzyme deficiency allows <b>glutaric</b> <b>acid,</b> 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and (to a lesser extent) glutaconic acid to build up to abnormal levels, especially at times when the body is under stress. These intermediate breakdown products are particularly prone to affect the basal ganglia, causing many of the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type 1.|$|E

Measured uptake coefficients lie in the range 5 x 10 (- 4) - 3 x 10 (- 2), dependent on relative humidity, on particle phase, and on particle composition. Uptake to solid particles is generally slow, with observed uptake coefficients less than 1 x 10 (- 3), while uptake to liquid particles is around {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient. These results are rationalized using a numerical model employing explicit treatment of both transport and chemistry.

The thickness and the optical constants of the thin PE layer were characterized using a prism coupling technique. The PE area was plasma etched and a 2. 775 -µm total etching depth was achieved. The measured average etching rate is 92. 5 nm/min.

Intorduction Lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) has drawn much attention because of its peculiar optical properties, such as electro-optic, acousto-optic, and piezoelectric effects. Conventionally, a waveguide in LiNbO 3 crystal is fabricated using metal diffusion, ion exchange, or proton exchange (PE). Compared with the common Ti in-diffusion method, the PE process has a much higher photorefractive damage threshold for guiding a visible laser[1]. Furthermore, many proton sources {{have been used in}} the PE process, including benzoic, adipic, stearic, octanoic, and <b>glutaric</b> <b>acids</b> and their mixtures[2 - 4].

40|$|An ion chromatographic {{method was}} {{developed}} which {{is able to}} separate five unsubstituted and hydroxy C- 4 dicarboxylic acids, succinic, malic, tartaric, maleic and fumaric acid, besides the other unsubstituted C- 2 -C- 5 dicarboxylic acids, oxalic, malonic and <b>glutaric</b> <b>acids,</b> as well as inorganic ions in samples extracted from atmospheric particulate matter. By the application of this method it was found for both rural and urban sites and for various types of air masses that in the summer-time malic acid is the most prominent C- 4 diacid (64 ng m(- 3) by average), exceeding succinic acid concentration (28 ng m(- 1) by average) considerably. In winter-time considerably less, a factor of 4 - 15, C- 4 acids occurred and succinic acid was more concentrated than malic acid. Tartaric, fumaric and maleic acids were less concentrated (5. 1, 5. 0 and 4. 5 ng m(- 1) by average, respectively). Tartaric acid was observed {{for the first time}} in ambient air. The results indicate that in particular anthropogenic sources are important for the precursors of succinic, maleic and fumaric acids. Biogenic sources seem to influence the occurrence of malic acid significantly. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Aspartate aminotransferase (glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase) was {{partially}} purified from extracts of germinating seeds of peanut (Arachis hypogaea), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), soybean (Glycine max), and Sophora japonica. The ability of these enzyme preparations, {{as well as}} aspartate aminotransferase purified from pig heart cytosol, to use 4 -substituted glutamic acids as amino group donors and their corresponding 2 -oxo acids as amino group acceptors in the aminotransferase reaction was measured. All 4 -substituted glutamic acid analogs tested were poorer substrates than was glutamate or 2 -oxoglutarate. 2 -Oxo- 4 -methyleneglutarate was least effective (lowest relative Vm/Km) as a substrate for the enzyme from peanuts and honey locust, which are the two species studied that accumulate 4 -methyleneglutamic acid and 4 -methyleneglutamine. Of the different aminotransferases tested, the enzyme from honey locust was the least active with 2 -oxo- 4 -hydroxy- 4 -methylglutarate, the corresponding amino acid of which also accumulates in that species. These results suggest that transamination of 2 -oxo- 4 -substituted <b>glutaric</b> <b>acids</b> {{is not involved in}} the biosynthesis of the corresponding 4 -substituted glutamic acids in these species. Rather, accumulation of certain 4 -substituted glutamic acids in these instances may be, in part, the result of the inefficacy of their transamination by aspartate aminotransferase...|$|R

40|$|Binary {{heterogeneous}} nucleation of water-succinic/glutaric/malonic/adipic acid on nanometer-sized particles is investigated {{within the}} frame of classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. Homogeneous nucleation is also included for comparison. It is found that the nucleation probabilities depend on the contact angle and {{on the size of}} the seed particles. New thermodynamical properties, such as saturation vapor pressure, density and surface tension for all the dicarboxylic acid aqueous solutions are included in the calculations. While the new surface tension and density formulations do not bring any significant difference in the computed nucleation rate for homogeneous nucleation for succinic and <b>glutaric</b> <b>acids,</b> the use of the newly derived equations for the vapor pressure decrease the acid concentrations in gas phase by 3 orders of magnitude. According to our calculations, the binary heterogeneous nucleation of succinic acid-water and glutaric acid-water – although it requires a 3 – 4 orders of magnitude lower vapor concentrations than the homogeneous nucleation – cannot take place under atmospheric conditions. On the other hand binary homogeneous nucleation of adipic acid-water systems might be possible under conditions occuring in upper boundary layer. However, a more detailed characterization of the interaction between the surface and the molecules of the nucleating vapor should be considered in the future...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} selected small organic species, present in aerosol particles as internal mixtures with sulphate, on cloud microphysical properties using a numerical model. The initial aerosol compositions were motivated by a prior model study {{in which it was}} shown that under certain conditions, small dicarboxylic acids, primarily oxalic and <b>glutaric</b> <b>acids,</b> can be efficiently formed via aqueous chemical processes in clouds and remain in the aerosol fraction upon drop evaporation. The simulations performed here separate the effects of the growth in particle mass via in-cloud oxidation from the change in composition of the resulting aerosol. Although the sulphate/organic mixed particles are somewhat less hygroscopic than pure ammonium sulphate, their activity as cloud condensation nuclei in a simulated constant updraft is similar, and the main influence of prior cloud processing of particles arises from the change in total mass and size distribution. We also performed a separate series of simulations initialized with an aerosol consisting of 90 % adipic acid/ 10 % ammonium sulphate, chosen to represent a lower limit on the mixed-particle hygroscopic behavior. If only the reduced solubility of the mixture, relative to that of pure sulphate aerosol, is considered, the drop number concentration is suppressed by up to 50 %, depending on the choice of initial conditions. However, the suppression of surface tension due to the presence of the organics, modeled using two different approaches, leads to a compensating effect that can result in little net change to the drop concentration relative to that for the pure sulphate aerosol...|$|R

Their concentrations maximized in the accumulation mode either at 0. 24 – 0. 40 or 0. 40 – 0. 8 μm aerodynamic diameters, suggesting that diacids were mainly formed by gas-to-particle conversion via photochemical oxidation of nonmethane hydrocarbons and oxygenated organics originated from continental pollution sources. The relative abundances of oxalic acid {{were higher in the}} 0. 24 - to 0. 4 -μm size particles (73 – 78 %) than in supermicrometer particles (40 – 60 %), indicating that oxalic acid is produced by gas phase oxidation of precursors followed by accumulation on preexisting particles. Mass size distributions of NH 4 + and SO 4 2 − peaked in the accumulation mode similar to those of small diacids. The sea-salt enrichment factor of K+ (biomass burning tracer) relative to Na+ maximized in 0. 1 - to 0. 8 -μm sizes, whereas those of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + (dust tracers) in 0. 4 - to 7. 8 -μm particles.
