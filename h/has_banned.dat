5|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} the pudú species are being taken {{in order to prevent}} extinction. An international captive-breeding program for the southern pudú led by Concepcion University in Chile has been started.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species <b>has</b> <b>banned</b> the international trading of pudús. The Wildlife Conservation Society protects their natural habitat and works to recreate it for pudús in captivity. Despite efforts made by the World Wildlife Fund, the size of the pudú population remains unknown. Threats to the pudús remain despite various conservation efforts.|$|E

5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand <b>has</b> <b>banned</b> the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
