2500|$|... it is {{stated that}} Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth's novel of The Miser's Daughter had been dramatised by Mr. Andrew Halliday, and {{produced}} at the Adelphi Theatre, and as {{my name is}} not mentioned in any way {{in connection with the}} novel—not even as the illustrator—I shall feel greatly obliged <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> me to inform the public through the medium of your columns of the fact (which all my private friends are aware of) that this tale of The Miser's Daughter originated from me, and not from Mr. Ainsworth.|$|E
2500|$|Paul says {{he opposes}} {{government}} assistance to private businesses {{intended to help}} shape research and investment decisions, including to promote alternative energy production and use. During a June 2011 presidential primary campaign debate, Paul said, “There shouldn't be any assistance to private enterprise. It's not morally correct, it's not legal, it's bad economics. It's {{not part of the}} Constitution. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> an economy to thrive, they'll decide how R works or where they invest their monies. But when the politicians get in and direct things, you get the malinvestment.” Similarly, in an October 2011 presidential primary campaign debate, he said, “The government shouldn't {{be in the business of}} subsidizing any form of energy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden faulted the United States for {{forcing him}} to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, [...] "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People never look at {{what would have happened if}} we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent." [...] "I have no apologies to offer," [...] Eden declared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Implicitly, Miss Beverley," [...] Crawshay {{pronounced}} emphatically, [...] "but {{under the}} circumstances I think no harm would be done <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allowed</b> our friend just to glance inside. The notes can easily be sealed up in another envelope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} {{act as a}} general aide-de-camp to you, admiral, than have a {{separate}} command, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me," [...] Francis said. [...] "I am still too young to command, and should be thwarted by rivalry and jealousies. I would, therefore, far rather act under your immediate orders, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will come}} down afterwards, about half-past eight, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me,' said Miss Steet, looking {{conscious}} and responsible.|$|R
2500|$|Baum's {{fairy tale}} {{contains}} many other allusions to American {{life in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, Dorothy's loyal companion, Toto, could be a play on [...] "teetotalers" [...] which {{is a person who}} never drinks alcohol. The prohibitionists deemed alcohol consumption should be unlawful and they were longtime political allies of Populists during the late 19th century. Toto trots [...] "soberly" [...] behind Dorothy on their adventure. The Winged Monkeys have been thought to resemble the Plains Indians who were [...] "once free people" [...] but were now enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. Their actions can be good or bad depending on how they are controlled; however, they [...] "belong to this country alone" [...] and therefore cannot leave, as can be said for American Indians. The Yellow Winkies that inhabit the Land of the West could represent Asian workers in California during the gold rush; their harsh work environment can be seen as enslavement. The lenses that the groups must wear before entering the City of Oz to dim the emeralds' shine turn out to be fake, like the Wizard. The Emerald City is not a city made of emeralds but a plain, white city where the emerald color lenses cast a green hue on everything and everyone. This shows that anything can be made to look spectacular <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> yourself to be tricked. Baum traveled all over the United States and would have been introduced to all these events in the 19th century, making it very likely that he drew inspiration from the land around him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What nonsense!" [...] cried Patsy, scornfully. [...] "Tell me, sir, what's {{to become}} of our grand motion picture enterprise, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> {{yourself}} to be shipped to Vienna as a captured thief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I must congratulate you,” he said. “You have lifted your firm {{into first}} rank by one bold stroke. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> your friends to help you, there’s an {{opportunity}} for a big development of your business.” ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CAROLINE. John! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> would <b>allow</b> your nephew to {{look after}} Lady Stutfield's cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.|$|R
6000|$|Ashley: [...] "But I don't know--Isobel, dearest, darling, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me {{to express}} myself so fully. How should I know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Bella,' {{replied the}} cherub, still pathetically scared, 'and my dear John Rokesmith, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me so to call you--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An only son," [...] {{said the}} Countess, [...] "but surely not an only child. You pay too high {{deference}} to our masters, the male sex, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> Julian to engross all your affection, and spare none for this beautiful girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is the swiftest craft on the river, and her owner's {{heart will}} be broken <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> the Britishers {{to get hold}} of her," [...] the officer in charge of the boat said as he passed me the painter of the canoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he {{will give}} his word!" [...] the {{professor}} cried excitedly. [...] "I am quite sure that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> {{me to talk to}} him reasonably, he will pledge his word {{to go back to the}} States and interfere no longer with your affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Kate, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me to speak,' said Mrs Nickleby, 'I shall {{take the}} liberty of {{explaining}} to this lady--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{undertake}} it myself, sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me," [...] {{the sergeant}} said, {{while the other}} men also volunteered for the duty.|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE. With pleasure. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me {{to present}} you with a {{professional}} man's earnings for six weeks--- (offering him Dolly's crown piece.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{never make}} a {{successful}} detective <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> your personal feelings to influence you," [...] returned Louise. [...] "I, too, sincerely hope that Thomas is innocent; {{but we are}} not justified in acquitting him until we have made a careful investigation and watched his actions." ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN: (With exaggerated politeness) This silken purse I {{made out}} of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> me. (He {{indicates}} vaguely Lynch and Bloom) We {{are all in the}} same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel ou tenons nostre état.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be a secret very long <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> people to overhear you calling her by her Christian name {{in the middle of the}} Academy, as you did me just now," [...] said Elinor, privately much taken aback, but {{resolute}} not to appear so.|$|E
6000|$|And {{the princess}} answered, 'I {{will give it}} to <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me to sleep to-night on the mat outside the prince's door.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear!' cried Tom. 'I shall only be too glad to {{consider}} myself engaged, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me; without any further {{reference to the}} place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] he said none too genially, [...] "in about half-an-hour <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me. There is another letter yet to write." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] she said, [...] "{{the rule}} in London {{is the rule}} here. My desk is never to be opened, except when I {{ask you to do}} it. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> the key to pass out of your own possession, you cease to be Keeper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suffer none {{to enter}} the hut till I return," [...] I said; [...] "and speak no word of the child {{that seems to be}} dead. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> any to enter, or if you speak a word, then my {{medicine}} will not work and the babe will be dead indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you are, eh? Well, I haven't got the stuff; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> yourselves to be swindled, {{will you}} help matters by turning thieves? You can sue {{the man who has}} done you up; but there's a penalty for stealing, as you will find out if you keep on in this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} greatly," [...] Vincent replied, [...] "and will, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me, take half my breakfast {{out to my}} boy, who is waiting over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our friend," [...] I said, [...] "has {{asked for}} one hour for consideration. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me, I should be pleased {{to show you the}} gardens and stables." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Within a stone's throw of Grosvenor Square," [...] Tavernake answered, briskly. [...] "It {{is really}} one of the most central spots in the west end. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{reasoning}} of Rollo's {{was very}} specious and plausible, {{but it was}} very erroneous notwithstanding; for it is found by experience that the whole amount of fatigue which results from doing any given piece of work {{is by no means the}} same when it is done quickly as when it is done slowly. A horse, for example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> him to jog along slowly, at the rate of three or four miles an hour, can travel forty miles a day, for months at a time, without growing thin; but if you drive him at the rate of eight miles an hour, he cannot stand more than ten miles a day for any long period. That is, he can do four times as much in amount, with the same degree of fatigue, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> him to do it slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}}," [...] said Uncle Chris seriously, [...] "that {{it is only}} that? Are you sure that your {{vitality}} has not become generally lowered by the fierce rush of Metropolitan life? Are you aware {{of the things that}} can happen to you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> the red corpuscles of your blood to become devitalised? I had a friend...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} to prepare {{yourself}} {{for a very}} disagreeable surprise, sir?" [...] says I. [...] "And, in case you lose your temper, will you excuse my remarking that I am the stronger man of the two, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>allow</b> yourself to lay hands on me, I may unintentionally hurt you, in pure self-defense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged," [...] he said, [...] "but I will not intrude upon <b>you</b> further. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me, I will {{ring the bell}} for my trap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} did marry Violet Brown," [...] Peter confessed, [...] "and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> {{me to say}} so, Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge, I should have recognized you anywhere from your photographs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} ordered the bill up to-morrow morning. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>allow</b> me {{to offer you}} twenty pounds, that will bring you to London when you please to follow." ...|$|R
