5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E

5|$|Sarolt {{gave birth}} to {{at least three of}} Géza's children; Stephen, who succeeded <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived Géza, which {{suggests}} that she was also the mother of Géza's daughters. Based on the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle, Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters' mother was Géza's alleged second wife Adelaide (Adleta) of Poland, but this has not been widely accepted. The following family tree presents Géza's ancestry and his offspring.|$|E
5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|Edward VIII succeeded <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 20 January 1936, {{after which}} Simpson {{attended}} more official functions as the King's guest. Despite her name appearing {{regularly in the}} Court Circular, {{the name of her}} husband was conspicuously absent. In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by the British press, which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E

50|$|Upon <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> death <b>on</b> 29 Nisan 1979, Friedman {{became the}} leader of the Sadigura Hasidim.

5|$|In 1216, an {{extraordinary}} parliamentary session {{was held in}} Valladolid, attended by such Castilian magnates as Lope Díaz II de Haro, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, Álvaro Díaz de Cameros, Alfonso Téllez de Meneses and others, who agreed, {{with the support of}} Berengaria, to make common cause against Álvaro Núñez de Lara. At the end of May the situation in Castile had grown perilous for Berengaria, so she decided to take refuge in the castle of Autillo de Campos, which was held by Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón (one of her allies) and sent her son Ferdinand to the court of <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> <b>On</b> 15 August 1216, an assembly of all the magnates of Castile was held to attempt to reach an accord that would prevent civil war, but disagreements led the families of Girón, Téllez de Meneses, and Haro to break definitively with Álvaro de Lara.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, Newton {{was born}} in Wapping, a {{district}} in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, {{and his mother was}} a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in {{what was}} to be a childless marriage. Soon after, he succeeded as duke upon the death of <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 29 January 1844. As reigning Duke Ernest II, he {{supported}} the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; as such, he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest's name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations fell through however for various reasons, not in the least of which was that he would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.|$|E

Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr. achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, {{one of the largest}} boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow, in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving {{one of the most popular}} fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In the West, {{however, the}} loose {{ends of the}} Diocletianic {{settlement}} were about to bring the whole Tetrarchic tapestry down. Constantine, son of Constantius, and Maxentius, son of Maximian, had been overlooked in the Diocletianic succession, offending the parents and angering the sons. Constantine, against Galerius's will, succeeded <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> July 25, 306. He immediately ended any ongoing persecutions and offered Christians full restitution {{of what they had}} lost under the persecution. This declaration gave Constantine the opportunity to portray himself as a possible liberator of oppressed Christians everywhere. Maxentius, meanwhile, had seized power in Rome on October 28, 306, and soon brought toleration to all Christians within his realm. Galerius made two attempts to unseat Maxentius, but failed both times. During the first campaign against Maxentius, Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{confusion}} of the rout, thousands of Bulgarian troops were killed and the remainder desperately attempted to flee westwards. Samuel and his son Gabriel Radomir immediately headed to the east from their headquarters in the Strumitsa fortress to aid their army, but in desperate fighting {{near the village of}} Mokrievo (present-day Republic of Macedonia) they were overwhelmed by the quickly advancing enemy. Many Bulgarian soldiers were killed at Mokrievo and many more were captured. Emperor Samuel himself barely escaped, only breaking free through the bravery of his son, who mounted <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> his own horse and took him to safety in Prilep. From Prilep, Samuel returned to Prespa while Gabriel Radomir headed towards Strumitsa to continue the struggle.|$|E

5|$|Mary married Walter IV of Brienne in {{the early}} 1230s. Isabella was engaged to Henry, the {{youngest}} son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, in 1228 or 1229, but their marriage took place only around 1233. Isabella was regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1263 to her death in 1264. Her son, Hugh, united Cyprus and Jerusalem in 1268. Alice's and Hugh I's only son, Henry, was born on 3 May 1217 and succeeded <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 10 January 1218. His rule in Cyprus only commenced following the expulsion in 1233 of the four baillis appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|Messi's {{financial}} affairs {{came under}} investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were allegedly used to evade €4.1million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama, {{set up in}} 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1million in August 2013. He stood trial alongside <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> three counts of tax evasion in May 2016. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7million and €1.4million in fines.|$|E

5|$|There are {{indications}} that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with <b>his</b> <b>father</b> <b>on</b> ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, {{on his way back}} to Normandy.|$|E
