Analyses of {{results have been}} presented on effectiveness of usage of a 4 - lane and a 6 - lane street with and without an <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> for buses. Two basic sub-models have been applied: - the binary logit model for modal split estimation; it takes into consideration the relation of travel time performed by private cars to public transport, - the polynomial model for predicting link impedance; the real travel time is affected by relation of traffic volume to the design capacity The parameters of both sub-models have been calibrated for the Polish conditions. The relationships are determined between number of person trips and traffic volume of buses/private cars, market share of public transport in motorised trips, average travel time lost in trips, average operation cost. An iterative technique addresses a feedback between the modal split and traffic volumes. Numerical calculations by use of EXCEL and MATLAB were carried out. Typical values of corridor length, occupancy rate of passenger car, design capacity of the bus, access and egress time {{to and from the}} parking/bus-stop in urban areas were applied. On the basis of the estimated results, the marginal parameter values: number of people carried at which separated lane for buses is most effective, traffic volume for private cars, traffic volume for buses and share of public transport in trips have been got by consideration of the average travel time lost and operational cost as criteria: Then introduction of street lanes with and without <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> for buses in relation to number of person trips can be optimized...|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} can considerably affect {{traffic flow}} particularly during heavy traffic conditions. Large numbers of heavy vehicle lane changing manoeuvres {{can contribute to}} increase the number of traffic accidents and hence to reduce the freeway safety. The increase in the number of heavy vehicles on freeways has been the motivation to establish strategies to reduce the interaction between heavy vehicles and passenger cars. Previous studies have examined different lane restriction strategies for heavy vehicles using microscopic traffic simulation packages. Those packages mostly use a general lane changing model to estimate the lane changing behavior of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers. The general lane changing models ignore the fundamental differences in the lane changing behavior of passenger cars and heavy vehicles. However, an <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> changing model for heavy vehicles can increase the accuracy of simulation models. The application of such a model can result in more reliable evaluation of lane restriction strategies. In this paper, different lane restriction strategies are defined for heavy vehicles. For each strategy, the macroscopic and microscopic traffic measurements of the two freeway sections in California are analyzed, using the VISSIM default lane changing model and an exclusive heavy vehicle lane changing model. The results show that the VISSIM default model unrealistically overestimates the observed number of heavy vehicle lane changing maneuvers and potentially overestimates the number of traffic accidents. Using the <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> changing model for heavy vehicles enhances the accuracy of the VISSIM traffic simulation model in microscopically estimating the lane changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Service {{interchange}} ramp terminals provide access {{from the local}} highway or urban street system to the freeway. In urban areas, the ramp terminals at the arterial road are usually signalized for separation of all high-volume conflicting movements. If right-turn or other movements exiting from the ramp terminals are high, a free right-turn lane, which improves operations for right-turn and through exiting traffic, is sometimes provided at the ramp terminals with an <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> for right-turn vehicles on a departure leg. If the ramp terminal is closely followed by the next downstream intersection, weaving maneuvers will occur since some vehicles make a right turn at the ramp terminal and make a left turn at the downstream intersection. These weaving vehicles usually slow down or stop on the free right-turn lane {{in order to find}} an acceptable gap in the arterial road traffic. These slowing or stopping vehicles may cause safety and operational problems. This research evaluates the effect of these weaving maneuvers on the operations of a free right-turn lane at the ramp terminals. To provide a means for evaluating free right-turn lane operations, a linear regression model was developed to predict the delay on the free right-turn lane caused by stopped or slowed vehicles planning on making a weaving maneuver. The variables for this model were arterial through volumes, weaving volumes, number of lanes, and ramp spacing within the interchange. The regression model was based upon the results of the CORSIM traffic simulation model that was calibrated using field data obtained from the study site in College Station, Texas. Once the predicted model was developed, the model validation was performed using the field data to check the accuracy of its prediction. A statistical measure was performed for quantifying the difference between the observed and predicted delay on the free right turn lane. From the research results, it was concluded that the weaving maneuvers influence the operation of a free right-turn lane and cause delay on the free right-turn lane...|$|E

The main concerns about Zurich and Curitiba are that they both achieved their implementation through particular policymaking processes; moreover the generalization of these types of policies has been very limited. The objectives of this thesis are to apply the three models from the agenda-building theory (Mobilization, Inside Access and Outside Initiative) to the context of public transportation to understand how innovative policy-making can be introduced and if the presence of a policy entrepreneur is necessary and sufficient. Using 11 cities in Europe and America that have implemented preferential treatment as case studies, the thesis identified elements necessary to address the public reaction, the institutional fragmentation and the decision-makers' positions. The research shows the necessity of public consultations and comprehensive planning exercises to convince the different stakeholders. Moreover, it points out the benefits of initiatives such as benchmarking or national legislation. Eventually, the thesis concludes that the policy-making theory can be expanded in acknowledging a combination of models to describe the preferential treatment's implementation process. On the other hand, the context of public transportation has evolved enough (concentration of decision powers and increasing public support) so that transit agencies can move towards implementation in focusing on stakeholder management strategies instead of relying on a policy entrepreneur. by Michael Pulichino.

40|$|This thesis {{structures}} {{a process}} to support transit agencies in their decision-making when improving their current conventional bus service (CBS) towards a higher quality system such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Four major tasks were conducted as follows. First a literatu re review was performed to study relevant prior research and BRT cases in operation in Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Bogota, Curitiba, and Ottawa. Second, {{and based on the}} case studies and literature review, eight key attributes and components of BRT systems were identified. The key attributes defined were: 1) right of way priority; 2) expedited boarding and alighting; 3) knowledge-based planning and operations; 4) high frequency; 5) high reliability; 6) distinct image; 7) connectivity; 8) land use integration. The physical bus components that could be changed in order to achieve these attributes were identified as the right-of-way, stops, vehicles, fare collection system, signal priority system, and automated vehicle location (AVL) system. The third task focused on developing a prioritization process to understand the variables that would lead to achieve the first two key attributes. All components but AVL systems were identified to impact these key attributes. The evaluation process to prioritize the critical variables of each component was based on the time savings and cost associated with their implementation. Time savings were evaluated from a user standpoint as the total travel time, including access time, waiting time, and in-vehicle time. Time savings for the agency were evaluated through running time reductions. Finally, the process was applied to Chicago transit Authority Express service 49 on Western Avenue in Chicago, IL. As a result, the implementation of the prioritized variables was recommended on two phases. The first phase (1 - 3 years) includes reducing the stop spacing on the X 49 route to increase coverage and demand, upgrade all buses used in the route to low-floor buses, expedite fare collection process through wider use of transit cards, implement active signal priority, implement preferential treatment for buses, and finally upgrade to contact-less smart cards. The second phase (3 - 5) years, includes implementing off-vehicle fare payment and conducting further analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of an <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> operation. by María del Pilar Rodríguez.

40|$|Lane {{changing}} manoeuvres have {{a substantial}} impact on microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics due to the interference effect they have on surrounding vehicles. The interference effects of heavy vehicles’ lane changing manoeuvres on surrounding traffic {{are likely to be}} greater than when passenger cars execute lane changing manoeuvre. While heavy vehicles account for a minority of traffic stream, heavy vehicles have a pronounced effect on traffic flow and produce a disproportionate effect particularly during heavy traffic conditions. Heavy vehicles impose physical and psychological effects on surrounding traffic which are the results of physical and operational characteristics of heavy vehicles. The number of heavy vehicles on urban freeways has increased {{over the past three decades}} and this trend is likely to continue over the next decade. Despite the increasing number of heavy vehicles on freeways, previous studies have predominantly focused on the behaviour of passenger car drivers. In the previous lane changing models, heavy vehicles are accommodated in current lane changing models by calibrating the parameters of a general lane changing model for heavy vehicles rather than by incorporating a lane changing model developed specifically for the heavy vehicle drivers. However, heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers may have fundamentally different lane changing behaviour. In this study, the trajectory dataset is based on the video images of two freeway sections. In general, extracting the trajectory dataset from video images makes it impossible to capture some physical (e. g. weight) and operational (e. g. power) characteristics of vehicles. The length of vehicles is one of their physical characteristics that can be extracted from video images. Therefore, vehicle length is used to identify heavy vehicles in this research. The vehicles with the length of equal to or greater than 6 meters are classified as heavy vehicles. This classification is consistent with the definition of the heavy vehicles in the trajectory dataset used for this study. In this research, the lane changing behaviour of a driver has been characterized as a sequence of three stages including motivation to change lanes, selection of the target lane and the execution of the lane change. This research has provided new insight into the role that traffic parameters associated with the surrounding vehicles plays in the lane changing behaviour of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers. From detailed examination of vehicle trajectory data, differences were identified in the lane changing of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers in terms of the three stages of lane changing behaviour. To understand the influencing factors on heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing, it is required to analyse the surrounding traffic characteristics at the time that the heavy vehicle drives change lanes as well as when they do not wish to execute lane changing manoeuvre. From detailed examination of the surrounding traffic characteristics, the explanatory variables in heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing decision were identified. A reliable model has been developed in this thesis to estimate the lane changing behaviour of heavy vehicle drivers. Drivers’ lane changing behaviour has been characterised as a sequence of two stages: the decision to change lanes and the execution of the lane change. Hence, separate models were considered for those two stages of the heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing behaviour. Fuzzy logic was used to develop a model of the lane changing decision of heavy vehicle drivers. The lane changing decision has been defined as the motivation for selecting either the right adjacent lane (slower lane) or the left adjacent lane (faster lane). Therefore, two separate models were developed for the lane changing decision of heavy vehicle drivers: Lane Changing to Slower Lane (LCSL) and Lane Changing to Faster Lane (LCFL). The explanatory variables in motivating heavy vehicle drivers to move into the slower lane include: the front space gap, the rear space gap, the lag space gap in the right lane and the average speed of the surrounding vehicles in the current lane. The explanatory variables in motivating heavy vehicle drivers to move into the faster lane include: the front relative speed, the lag relative speed in the left lane and the average speeds of the surrounding vehicles in the current lane and the left lane. A triangular membership function was used for all fuzzy sets in the lane changing decision model. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to examine the accuracy of the models in estimating the lane changing manoeuvres of heavy vehicle drivers. The obtained results showed that the LCFL model has higher percentage of accurately estimating the heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing decision. This may be due to the fact that heavy vehicle drivers mainly move into the faster lane to gain speed advantages which could be modelled by the microscopic traffic characteristics of surrounding vehicles in the current and the left lanes. However, the heavy vehicle drivers may have other motivations for moving into the slower lane than only the differences in microscopic traffic characteristics in the current and the right lanes. The speed and acceleration/deceleration profiles of heavy vehicles were analysed in detail from the start to the end of lane changing manoeuvres. The results showed that heavy vehicle drivers maintain an almost constant speed during lane changing execution. They do not accelerate or decelerate to adjust their speed according to the speeds of the surrounding vehicles in the target lane. Subsequently, a simple constant speed model could be assumed for the heavy vehicles during the lane changing execution. Finally, the performance of the heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing model was examined macroscopically and microscopically using VISSIM (German abbreviation for ‘traffic simulation in cities’) microscopic traffic simulation model. The heavy vehicle lane changing model in VISSIM was substituted with a combination of the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane changing decision model and a constant speed lane changing execution model. The traffic measurements obtained from the fuzzy logic model were compared to those obtained from a calibrated VISSIM lane changing model and the actual field observations. The results show that using the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane changing model provided more accurate estimates of the macroscopic traffic measurements. The number of heavy vehicle lane changing manoeuvres estimated by the fuzzy logic model was found to be more accurate than the estimates from default lane changing model in VISSIM. The microscopic analysis of the lane changing manoeuvres shows that using the fuzzy logic model more accurately replicated the microscopic lane changing behaviour of the heavy vehicle drivers. In particular, the fuzzy logic model accurately replicates the observed speed profile of heavy vehicles and the observed space gap and speed profiles of the surrounding vehicles during lane changing manoeuvres. The superior performance of the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing model highlights the importance of developing an <b>exclusive</b> <b>lane</b> changing model for heavy vehicle drivers. Employing a purpose built heavy vehicle lane changing model has been shown to increase the accuracy of the microscopic traffic simulation model...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to develop an improved lane-changing model that has a generalized structure and is flexible enough to capture the lane-changing behavior in all situations including the presence of unlimited access <b>exclusive</b> <b>lanes.</b> A new lane-changing model with explicit choice of target lane is proposed in this regard. The target lane is the lane the driver perceives as the best to be in taking a wide range of factors and goals into account. The direction of the immediate lane change is based on the choice of this target lane rather than myopic evaluation of adjacent lanes. A lane change occurs in the direction implied by the chosen target lane depending upon gap availability. The parameters of the model are jointly estimated with detailed vehicle trajectory data and calibrated for a situation with unlimited access High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane. Estimation results show that the target lane choice is affected by lane-specific attributes, such as average speed and density, variables that relate to the path plan and the interactions of the vehicle with other vehicles surrounding it. The model is validated and compared with an existing lane-changing model using a microscopic traffic simulator in an HOV lane situation. The results indicate that the proposed model is significantly better than the previous model. by Charisma Farheen Choudhury. Thesis (S. M.)
