5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and shaking the stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E

Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} after Hotelito Desconocido was shut down, local {{authorities}} from Tomatlán expressed their worry on the effects it would have on tourism and unemployment; they stated that its closure would impact the economy and make Tomatlán less attractive for international tourists, {{and that it would}} cause around 100 people to lose their jobs. The Jalisco Secretariat of Tourism stated that one less hotel in town was a <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> for meeting accommodation demands for visitors. According to a spokesperson from the agency, Hotelito Desconocido met all the requirements lawmakers were looking for it to fullfill. He also stated that the hotel participated in campaigns to promote local tourism. Another local tourism official said he hoped that the closure of Hotelito Desconocido would not negatively affect the ecosystem of the area (particularly the turtle release programs).|$|E

In the new government, privatisation was continued on a much greater scale than before: a big and important chain of fish processing plants was sold; part-public or public investment funds were merged and sold as a private investment bank; the two commercial banks under government control were sold in a few stages; The two coalition parties accepted the loud demand by many people that a charge would be imposed on the holders of fishing quotas.|$|E

Together they formed the largest galley navy in the Mediterranean in the early 17th century. They formed the backbone of the Spanish war fleet and were used for ferrying troops, supplies, horses and munitions to Spain's Italian and African possessions. The Ottoman Turks attempted to contest the Portuguese rise to power in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century with Mediterranean-style galleys, but were foiled by the formidable Portuguese carracks. Even though the carracks themselves were soon surpassed by other types of sailing vessels, their greater range, great size and high superstructures, armed with numerous wrought iron guns easily outmatched the short-ranged, low-freeboard Turkish galleys. The Spanish used galleys to more success in their colonial possessions in the Caribbean and the Philippines to hunt pirates and were used sporadically in the Netherlands and the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Grupo Garza Ponce nearly {{went out}} of {{business}} due to the 1982 debt crisis; the prices that the company paid for its supplies were fluctuating by between 10 and 12%, and according to José María Garza Treviño, the President of Grupo Garza Ponce, this forced the company to change its business model each month. Grupo Garza Ponce experienced a <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> in personnel, but they were able to recuperate by tapping different markets and forging business projects with transnational companies. During the 1980s, Grupo Garza Ponce consolidated their services into 6 different business units: GP Construcción, GP Desarrollos, GP Servicios, GP Vivienda, GP Residencial, GP Asfaltos y Precolados. The last one was later broken down into two separate entities, GP Precolados and GP Concreto Asfáltico. With the economic crisis, demand for public works declined in northern Mexico; this forced Grupo Garza Ponce to close agreements with companies in the private sector.|$|E
25|$|The Viva {{remained}} on sale {{until the end}} of 1979, when the Opel Kadett D was launched. It was intended that this car would also be produced in America and the UK, as the second generation Chevette, but due to various industrial issues at the time GM decided to shelve most of the Ellesmere Port Plant, retaining only the assembly shop to build the new car. These would be produced from 'knock-down' kits shipped from Opel's Russelsheim plant. Due to the <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> of workforce which this would cause, representations were made which resulted in the decision to continue production of existing models alongside the new. This meant that a new name would have to be found for Vauxhall's version of the new Opel Kadett, and so in March 1980 the Vauxhall Astra was born, replacing the Viva in the Vauxhall range, while the Chevette {{remained on}} sale until 1984. At this time, the planned mothballing of the major proportion of the Ellesmere Port Plant went ahead as originally planned.|$|E

In May, rumors emerged that A was in more financial trouble as it declared a <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> (in April) for the previous year, losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away, A considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years. There were rumors that A would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices, shrinking the company to about 100 stores; other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation, selling the company in pieces, as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole, receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored, including selling other assets.|$|E

In the quarter-finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were ruthless, as they emphatically won against the West Indies side by 10 wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the semi-finals on 30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India managed 260 after they batted first.

25|$|After early {{elections}} in 2003 Balkenende formed his second government with: Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again {{leader of a}} centre-right coalition, Balkenende's policies centred on reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European Elections, beating the general expectation of a <b>huge</b> <b>loss</b> in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26–33% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position {{as leader of the}} CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept this and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende's popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister while 40% preferred Bos. This switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during {{the last year of his}} administration and the positive effects of the reformed policy of the Balkenende cabinet, combined with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime-minister.|$|E
