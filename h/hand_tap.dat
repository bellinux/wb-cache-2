500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina. Able to run on both petrol and LPG, it features an advanced sequential vapour gas injection (SVGI) system and hardened valve seats to cope. The bi-fuel V6 produces [...] and [...] less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, {{for a total of}} [...] Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large [...] cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption. Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve <b>hand</b> <b>tap,</b> Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The Second Life {{platform}} unites various technologies: 3 D virtual environments, virtual reality, Internet {{connection between}} participants {{and the possibility}} of customization of the three-dimensional content. It is a virtual collaborative environment that allows users to explore digital worlds and interact with others in real time. Increasingly, new peripherals to interact with virtual environments are emerging in the market, and good examples of this are 3 Dconnexion's 3 D controllers. These are designed to be easy to use, allowing users to zoom, move around in space and rotate 3 D objects with a simple <b>hand</b> <b>tap</b> on the device. With this project we wanted to identify usability problems among 3 Dconnexion's devices in Second Life 3 D virtual environment. We created a usability test and implemented it.

40|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} has {{attracted}} research interest {{ever since the}} 1930 s. For many researchers the menstrual cycle is an excellent model of ovarian steroid influence on emotion, behavior, and cognition. Over the past years methodological improvements in menstrual cycle studies have been noted, and this review summarizes the findings of methodologically sound menstrual cycle studies in healthy women. Whereas the predominant hypotheses of the cognitive field state that sexually dimorphic cognitive skills that favor men are improved during menstrual cycle phases with low estrogen and that cognitive skills that favor women are improved during cycle phases with increased estrogen and/or progesterone, this review has not found sufficient evidence to support any of these hypotheses. Mental rotation has gained specific interest in this aspect, but a meta-analysis yielded a standardized mean difference in error rate of 1. 61 (95 % CI - 0. 35 – 3. 57), suggesting, at present, no favor of an early follicular phase improvement in mental rotation performance. Besides the sexually dimorphic cognitive skills, studies exploring menstrual cycle effects on tasks that probe prefrontal cortex function, for instance verbal or spatial working memory, have also been reviewed. While studies thus far are few, results at hand suggest improved performance at times of high estradiol levels. Menstrual cycle studies on emotional processing, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>tap</b> into the emotional disorders of the luteal phase, and may be of relevance for women with premenstrual disorders. Although evidence at present is limited, {{it is suggested that}} emotion recognition, consolidation of emotional memories, and fear extinction is modulated by the menstrual cycle in women. With the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, several studies report changes in brain reactivity across the menstrual cycle, most notably increased amygdala reactivity in the luteal phase...|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{a lot of}} {{achievements}} {{have been}} obtained in imaging and cognitive neuroscience of human brain. Brain’s activities can be shown {{by a number of}} different kinds of non-invasive technologies, such as: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) (Wolpaw et al., 2002;Weiskopf et al., 2004;Blankertz et al., 2006). NIRS has become the convenient technology for experimental brain purposes. The change of oxygenation changes (oxy-Hb) along task period depending on location of channel on the cortex has been studied: sustained activation in the motor cortex, transient activation during the initial segments in the somatosensory cortex, and accumulating activation in the frontal lobe (Gentili et al., 2010). Oxy-Hb concentration at the aforementioned sites in the brain can also be used as a predictive factor allows prediction of subject’s investigation behavior with a considerable degree of precision (Shimokawa et al., 2009). In this paper, a study of recognition algorithm will be described for recognition whether one <b>taps</b> the left <b>hand</b> or the right hand. Data with noises and artifacts collected from a multi-channel system will be pre-processed using a Savitzky- Golay filter for getting more smoothly data. Characteristics of the filtered signals during left and right <b>hand</b> <b>tapping</b> process will be extracted using a polynomial regression algorithm. Coefficients of the polynomial, which correspond to Oxygen-Hemoglobin (Oxy- Hb) concentration, will be applied for the recognition models of <b>hand</b> <b>tapping.</b> Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be applied to validate the obtained coefficient data for <b>hand</b> <b>tapping</b> recognition.

We used functional MR Imaging (fMRI) to explore brain activation in FRDA patients during two motor-sensory tasks of different complexity, i. e. continuous <b>hand</b> <b>tapping</b> and writing of 8 figure, with the right dominant hand and without visual feedback. Seventeen FRDA patients and two groups of age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Task execution was monitored and recorded using MR-compatible devices. <b>Hand</b> <b>tapping</b> was correctly performed by 11 (65 %) patients and writing of the 8 by 7 (41 %) patients. After correction for behavioral variables, FRDA patients showed in both tasks areas of significantly lower activation in the left primary sensory-motor cortex and right cerebellum. Also left thalamus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed hypo-activation during <b>hand</b> <b>tapping.</b> During writing of the 8 task FRDA patients showed areas of higher activation in the right parietal and precentral cortex, globus pallidus, and putamen. Activation of right parietal cortex, anterior cingulum, globus pallidus, and putamen during writing of the 8 increased with severity of the neurological deficit. In conclusion fMRI demonstrates in FRDA a mixed pattern constituted by areas of decreased activation and areas of increased activation. The decreased activation in the primary motor cortex and cerebellum presumably reflects a regional neuronal damage, the decreased activation of the left thalamus and primary sensory cortex could be secondary to deafferentation phenomena, and the increased activation of right parietal cortex and striatum might have a possible compensatory significance.
