5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, <b>knew</b> <b>by</b> June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she <b>knew,</b> <b>by</b> someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E

40|$|With a {{point of}} {{departure}} in a transactional understanding of epistemology, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore practical epistemologies in PE by investigating how knowledge is produced and reproduced in students’ and teachers’ actions in PE practices posted as clips on the user-generated video sharing website YouTube. YouTube can be understood as a disordered public video archive of (in this case) ongoing PE practices created by both students and teachers.  With a transactional understanding, knowing, and in consequence questions of epistemology, can be conceived of as something we do; something practical (Dewey & Bentley 1949). In this paper, practical epistemologies in PE are, in line with Dewey (1938, 1941), investigated by exploring ends-in-view and habits-of-action in students’ and teachers’ actions in PE practice.  The practical epistemologies identified in the study are: (i) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> doing correct movements, (ii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> trying, (iii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> imitating, (iv) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> praising and cheering, (v) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> cooperating, (vi) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> creating, (vii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> being changed into gym clothes, (viii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> acting in a certain locality and (ix) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> resisting. The categories represent different ways of how knowledge is produced and reproduced in PE practice and describe the functions that different actions and actors have in how knowledge is produced and reproduced as well as in the direction this takes...|$|R

He mulled over the possibility that the Chinese characters were an unwitting form of his universal characteristic. He noted with fascination how the I Ching hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.|$|E

She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver.

500|$|What Maisie Knew {{was written}} by Carroll Cartwright and Nancy Doyne in 1995, based on the 1897 novel What Maisie <b>Knew</b> <b>by</b> Henry James. At the time, Cartwright was {{involved}} in a legal dispute over the custody of his daughter. Director Scott McGehee later said that Cartwright had used James' novel [...] "as a lens" [...] through which to write about his own divorce and raising his daughter. According to Cartwright, he and Doyne struggled to find producers, financiers and directors interested in making the film because of the challenges of working with a young child at its center. Producer Charles Weinstock was involved in the project {{for a number of years}} and was eventually responsible for obtaining financing from Red Crown Productions and hiring McGehee and David Siegel as directors. McGehee and Siegel were initially apprehensive about the script but decided to read it after hearing from their agent that actress Julianne Moore was interested in playing one of the roles; they accepted the directing job after talking to Moore about the story. Although McGehee and Siegel were reluctant to make a film about divorce, they liked that the script focused on Maisie's perspective, noting that it was unusual for a film aimed at adults to have a story told from the perspective of a child.|$|E

The network opposed the idea of a cliffhanger leading up to a possible movie, and since the producers never intended [...] "to blow up the SGC and kill everyone", the episode's theme and name were chosen to give [...] "a sense of ending without it being an ending". This move also allowed for the fan conspiracy theories surrounding a possible real Stargate in the underground Cheyenne Mountain Complex to continue.

With respect to the use {{to which it is}} put in the relevant texts, whereas not being <b>known</b> <b>by</b> God adds severity to dire warnings, being <b>known</b> <b>by</b> God promotes humility and supplies comfort and security.
