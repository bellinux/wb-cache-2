50|$|As {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} exhausted {{to a large}} extent as building blocks for life science products, N-heterocyclic structures prevail nowadays. They are found in many natural products, such as chlorophyll; hemoglobin; and the vitamins biotin, folic acid, niacin (PP), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1). In synthetic life science products, N-heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Thus, β-lactams are structural elements of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, imidazoles are found both in modern herbicides, e.g. Arsenal (imazapyr) and pharmaceuticals, e.g. the antiulcerants Tagamet (cimetidine. see above) and Nexium (omeprazole), the antimycotics Daktarin (miconazole), Fungarest (ketoconazole) and Travogen (isoconazole). Tetrazoles and tetrazolidines are pivotal parts of the “sartan” class of hypertensives, e.g. Candesartan cilexetil (candesartan), Avapro (<b>irbesartan),</b> Cozaar (losartan) and Diovan (valsartan).|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin II {{receptor}} blockers {{are used}} {{primarily for the}} treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy. They do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. More recently, they have been used {{for the treatment of}} heart failure in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, in particular candesartan. <b>Irbesartan</b> and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes, and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

50|$|Structure-activity {{relationship}} (SAR)Most of the ARBs {{have the}} same pharmacophore so the difference in their biochemical and physiological effects is mostly due to different substituents. Activity of a drug is dependent of its affinity for the substrate site {{and the length of}} time it binds to the site.Lipophilic substituents like the linear alkyl group at the 2-position on the imidazole ring together with the biphenyl-methyl group, associate with hydrophobic pockets of the receptor. An acidic group like tetrazole, CO2H or NHSO2CF3 at the 1-position of the biphenyl-methyl group will bind to a basic position in the receptor and are required for potent antagonistic activity. In valsartan, the imidazole ring of losartan has been replaced with an acylated amino acid.Several substituents have been tried at the 4- and 5- positions on the imidazole ring. The chloro and hydroxymethyl groups connected to these positions in losartan are probably not of much importance in receptor binding since the other ARBs do not possess these functional groups and have comparable or better binding affinities than losartan. <b>Irbesartan</b> has a carbonyl group at the 5-position, functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor in place of the hydroxymethyl group of losartan, resulting in a longer binding to the receptor. The structure of eprosartan is the one that differs most from the other ARBs, the usual biphenyl-methyl group {{has been replaced by a}} carboxy benzyl group that mimics more closely the phenolic moiety of Tyr4 group of Ang II. This change results in a stronger binding to the receptor but the biochemical and physiological effects are not significantly improved. Telmisartan has a carboxylic acid at the 2-position of the biphenyl-methyl group and is more potent than the tetrazole analogue. It has been reported that imidazoles that have hydroxymethyl and carboxy groups at the 4- and 5 position, possessed potent antagonistic activity, caused by the hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity of the hydroxymethyl group.It has also been reported that an hydroxy group in the 4-position on the imidazole ring, plays an important role in the binding affinity and compensates for the disadvantage of lipophilicity of the bulky alkyl group.These results show that a medium-sized hydroxy alkyl group, such as CHMeOH and CMe2OH, is favorable for the substituent of the 4-position on the imidazole ring. Furthermore, the ionizable group is favorable for the binding affinity.|$|E

Research design and methods: A previously published Markov model simulated progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine, end- stage renal disease and death. Three treatment strategies with analogous blood pressure control were compared: (A) control - conventionally medicated antihypertensive therapy (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, other angiotensin- 2 -receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) initiated at microalbuminuria; (B) early <b>irbesartan</b> - (300 mg daily added to control, initiated with microalbuminuria) and (C) late <b>irbesartan</b> - (300 mg daily, initiated with overt nephropathy). Probabilities came from the <b>Irbesartan</b> in Reduction of Microalbuminuria- 2 study, <b>Irbesartan</b> in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and other sources. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over 25 years. Annual discount rates were 3 %. Results: Compared to control, early use of <b>irbesartan</b> added (mean +/- standard deviation) 1. 51 +/- 0. 08 undiscounted life years (discounted: 0. 94 +/- 0. 05 years), while late <b>irbesartan</b> added 0. 07 +/- 0. 01 (0. 04 +/- 0. 01) years/ patient.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, and cost-effectiveness of treatment with <b>irbesartan</b> in hypertension. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted using the electronic PubMed and Cochrane Library databases and the Health Economic Evaluations Database of search terms relating to <b>irbesartan</b> efficacy, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness, and the results were utilized. Results: Findings from the present analysis show that <b>irbesartan</b> either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents can achieve significant reductions in blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, compared with alternative treatment options. <b>Irbesartan</b> was also found to have a renoprotective effect independent of its blood pressure-lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
