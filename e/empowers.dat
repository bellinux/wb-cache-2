40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>empowering</b> {{leadership}} has {{attracted the attention}} of both academics and practitioners because of its important role in enhancing employee performance. Although empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that <b>empowering</b> leadership can {{have a significant effect on}} positive managerial outcomes, there is a paucity of research on its antecedents and processes through which it influences work outcomes. Thus, this study suggests a comprehensive conceptual model of <b>empowering</b> leadership, mainly focusing on the trickle-down effects of across levels of hierarchy. Specifically, based on theories of social learning and social exchange, this study examines the influence of <b>empowering</b> leadership of second-level leaders on subordinates’ various work outcomes through first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership to help identify mediating process that may underlie relationships between second-level leaders and subordinates’ outcomes. Additionally, in order to explore the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership in detail, this study focuses on the antecedents and processes of <b>empowering</b> leadership learning. Data were obtained from subordinate–supervisor dyads from the South Korean Army. The results of this study showed mediating effects of first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership on the relationship between second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership and subordinates’ task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, and social loafing. These results support the trickle-down effects of <b>empowering</b> leadership on subordinates’ outcomes. Moreover, LLX mediates the relationship between second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership and the first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership, and this result supports the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership. Exchange ideology also moderated the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership, such that the relationship was stronger when exchange ideology was low rather than high. The results of this study have both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study provides empirical evidence to help determine whether second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership facilitates first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study contributes to the literature by further examining the antecedents of <b>empowering</b> leadership by showing how relational, individual, and situational factors influence <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study also explains how <b>empowering</b> leadership can spread across multiple downward linkages by supporting the existence of “trickle-down effects” of <b>empowering</b> leadership. Practically, this study helps understand the importance of high-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership to facilitate their low-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study also suggests the importance of relational, individual, and contextual factors to facilitate the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership. In conclusion, <b>empowering</b> leadership has a synergistic effect across leadership levels; therefore, top managers and high-level leaders should focus on training <b>empowering</b> leadership of field managers and leading by example to create a more <b>empowering</b> environment. However, this study has limitations, such as the use of cross-sectional analyses and perceptual data. Future research may seek to use longitudinal and objective measures...|$|R

5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states.

However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also <b>empowers</b> the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent.

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs <b>empowers</b> the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices.

5|$|The monarch {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation {{of the armed forces}} and ecclesiastical appointments.

In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory.

To fill this research gap, the present study examined the multi-level <b>empowering</b> leadership processes which explain the individual-, group-, and cross-level effects of <b>empowering</b> leadership on subordinate individual and collective empowerment. The hypothesized, multi-level mediation and moderation relationships were examined with 132 employees working in 26 work groups in a multi-national chemical company. Two paper-based surveys were distributed for collecting data over two time points. The results revealed that, at the individual level, leader-member exchange (LMX) was, as expected, a partial mediator between <b>empowering</b> leadership and subordinate psychological empowerment. At the group level, it was found that subordinates 2 ̆ 7 team empowerment was affected via distributive justice climate by {{the extent to which a}} leader differentially <b>empower</b> subordinates in a work group (differentiated <b>empowering</b> leadership) and the extent to which LMX is differentiated (LMX differentiation). Specifically, differentiated <b>empowering</b> {{leadership was}} found to positively influence LMX differentiation which had negative impact on subsequent distributive justice climate which, in turn, positively affected team empowerment. In addition, although the expected moderating role of group power distance on the relationship between LMX differentiation and distributive justice climate was not found, the predicted moderating role of subordinate generalized self-efficacy was found such that it attenuated the effects of <b>empowering</b> leadership on subordinate psychological empowerment. In the post hoc data analyses, generalized self-efficacy weakened the effects of <b>empowering</b> leadership on LMX; LMX was found to mediate the interactive effects of generalized self-efficacy and <b>empowering</b> leadership on subordinate psychological empowerment. Finally, unexpectedly, two group-level constructs of differentiated <b>empowering</b> leadership and LMX differentiation were not found to moderate the individual-level <b>empowering</b> leadership-LMX relationship and the individual-level LMX-psychological empowerment relationship, respectively. Given these findings, this study suggests that a leader who wants to <b>empower</b> subordinates may need to build a good work relationship with each individual subordinate and may consider not so differentially developing such good work relationships with several subordinates in a work group. It is also suggested that a leader who attempts to <b>empower</b> subordinates may need to understand the nature of subordinate individual attributes and to suitably adjust his or her own behaviors. ...|$|R
