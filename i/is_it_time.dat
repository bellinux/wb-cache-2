You're going to let it continue and come to a conclusion? And then overturn it? The reason to stop it sooner was not, [...] "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"... you forget what was going on at the time. We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>time</b> cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I {{be able to look at}} myself in the mirror happily? No. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1950s {{dams and}} {{thousands}} of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thus {{cut off from the}} main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from [...] in the 1950s to [...] in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable [...] "iron barrier" [...] that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the Baiji Dolphin, finless porpoise and the Yangtze Alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.|$|E
