5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on <b>glass</b> <b>cover</b> slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a microscope slide that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the <b>glass</b> <b>cover,</b> filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E
500|$|Dei Gratia {{had reached}} a {{position}} of 38°20'N, 17°15'W, midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal at about 1 pm on Wednesday, December 4, 1872, land time (Thursday, December 5, sea time). As Captain Morehouse came on deck, the helmsman reported a vessel about [...] distant, heading unsteadily towards Dei Gratia. The ship's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong. As the vessels drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's boat to investigate. From the name on her stern the pair established {{that this was the}} Mary Celeste; they then climbed aboard, where they found the ship deserted. The sails, partly set, were in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship's single lifeboat, a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, was missing, while the binnacle housing the ship's compass had shifted from its place, its <b>glass</b> <b>cover</b> broken. There was about [...] of water in the hold, a significant but not alarming amount for a ship this size. A makeshift sounding rod (a device for measuring the amount of water in the hold) was found abandoned on the deck.|$|E

2500|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{is built}} of any material that passes sunlight usually glass, or plastic. The sun warms {{the ground and}} contents inside just like the outside, which then warms the air. Outside, the warm air near the surface rises and mixes with cooler air aloft, keeping the temperature lower than inside, where the air continues to heat up because it is confined within the greenhouse. This can be demonstrated by opening a small window near {{the roof of a}} greenhouse: the temperature will drop considerably. It was demonstrated experimentally (R. W. Wood, 1909) that a (not heated) [...] "greenhouse" [...] with a cover of rock salt (which is transparent to infrared) heats up an enclosure similarly to one with a <b>glass</b> <b>cover.</b> Thus greenhouses work primarily by preventing convective cooling.|$|E

Arrays of parallel FeSiB <b>glass</b> <b>covered</b> wires, fixed at the one end and free at the other are set normal to the fluid flow inside of an array of thin coils, thus covering the whole cross section of the fluid conduit. An excitation coil is also used for static flow measurements. The displacement of each <b>glass</b> <b>covered</b> wire corresponds to the local velocity of the fluid. It has been determined that the uncertainty of the voltage output dependence on the fluid flow is better than 1 %. So, the profile of the fluid velocity along the cross section of the fluid conduit can be determined...|$|R
