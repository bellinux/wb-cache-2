50|$|For filming, {{the series}} used two {{full-scale}} metal replicas of first generation (1912-16) Stutz Bearcats made by Hollywood car customizer and film car builder George Barris. While externally {{very close to}} the original cars, in fact they were built on custom chassis powered by Ford drivetrains and had modern four wheel brake systems for safety. The two replicas were very similar to one another, however the first built (and the one used for most filming) had a manual 4-speed transmission while the second had an automatic. Additionally, there was a slight variation in the location of the <b>horn</b> <b>bulb</b> and the pinstripes {{on the sides of the}} hood of the second car, so the cars can be differentiated while closely viewing the episodes. In addition to the two cars used in the series, Barris built and retained a third car for use at car shows which differed in many details and color from the TV cars. All three cars survive today, though Barris' display car has been extensively modified. The original Stutz Bearcat automobiles had been manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana; the Stutz factory building still exists but is currently used as an arts and office complex.|$|E

50|$|Bicycles {{often have}} a classic <b>bulb</b> <b>horn,</b> {{operated}} by squeezing a rubber bulb attached to a metal <b>horn.</b> Squeezing the <b>bulb</b> forces air through a steel reed located in the throat of the horn, making it vibrate, producing a single note. The flaring horn matches the acoustic impedance of the reed to the open air, radiating the sound waves efficiently, making the sound louder. Other types of horns used on bicycles include battery-operated horns (sometimes even car horns on 12-volt circuits are incorporated) and small air horns powered by a small can of compressed gas.|$|R
50|$|When {{production}} {{began in}} 1919 an electric starter would be supplied {{for an extra}} £50 though it was standard on Vauxhall's 25 hp car. But Vauxhall did make no separate charge for: electric lighting, a clock, speedometer, spare wheel and tyre, full tool kit and number plates. Customers could choose between a bonnet of plain polished aluminium or have it painted to match {{the rest of the}} car. Advertisements for the OE when introduced in 1922 noted the electric lighting now included six lamps, an instrument board lamp and gauges together with both an electric <b>horn</b> and a <b>bulb</b> <b>horn.</b> By 1927 the advertised equipment was limited to: bucket-shaped front seats adjustable for leg room; wire wheels and Dunlop cord tyres, two spare wheels and tyres; spring gaiters; luggage grid and windscreen wiper (singular).|$|R
500|$|Although no {{official}} music video {{was created for}} this single, Yankovic and Schwartz performed [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder. During the performance, Yankovic played his accordion and Schwartz banged on Yankovic's accordion case and played <b>bulb</b> <b>horns.</b> The Tomorrow Show performance was later included on the [...] (2003) DVD as a bonus feature.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{types of}} vehicle horns {{are used by}} percussionists as sound effects, or even melodically, in musical works. For example, George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral work An American in Paris calls {{for the use of}} 4 taxi horns. György Ligeti's opera Le Grand Macabre {{features}} two [...] "Car Horn Preludes" [...] scored for 12 <b>bulb</b> <b>horns,</b> each one tuned to a specific pitch.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} model was created in Abaqus to model the {{interaction}} between bovine claws and concrete floors with defined roughness and friction coefficients. The geometry of the claw horn capsule was built by using X-ray tomgraphy scanner images of an unloaded bovin claw. A volumetric mesh was applied, consisting of tetrahedral elements. The horn {{was considered to be}} an isotropic elastic material. Different Young's moduli were attributed to dorsal wall horn, abaxial and axial wall <b>horn,</b> and <b>bulb</b> <b>horn.</b> The top border area of the horn capsule was fixed to restrain it from motion, but angular rotations were allowed. The model was completed by introducting a rigid support that simulated a concrete floor. With this model the effect of varying floor roughness and claw-floor friction on contact pressures and von Mises stresses in the claw horn was evaluated. Under loads up to 6 kN, contact pressures up to 28 MPa and von Mises stresses up to 19 MPa were found. Maximum von Mises stresses are registered in the claw sole. the roughness of the floor was the main determinant in the occurring contact pressures. The contact pressure results were compared to the values measured in a laboratory experiment on claws in a hydraulic compression machine...|$|R

5000|$|The Model B was {{available}} as a runabout or a touring car with a detachable rear-entrance tonneau and optional surrey top, or with a delivery body. The passenger cars were both priced at $900 and weighed roughly 1450 lb. Options now included a <b>bulb</b> <b>horn</b> and a deck to replace the tonneau. The Model B continued in production through 1905 when an alternative tubular front axle {{was available}} and the power was advertised as [...]|$|R
50|$|The hornophone is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} composed {{of a number of}} reed <b>bulb</b> <b>horns,</b> typically used as vehicle horns, clamped into a metal frame. The arrangement of the horns is much like a xylophone or glockenspiel, tuned to a heptatonic scale. Ordinarily there is either a higher or lower rack or mounting of horns tuned to sharps and flats, like the black notes of a musical keyboard. The instrument is typically played standing, by squeezing the <b>bulbs</b> of the <b>horns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PPV may be {{considered}} a forerunner of the modern velomobile. This tricycle was manufactured with a three-speed, floor shift, open type transmission with a single-wheel drive. Either the driver or the passenger could pedal independently or as a team. Reverse was accomplished by reaching outside and turning one of the rear wheels by hand. At one time, a rear-hinged, surrey top was available. Most were manufactured with a dark blue bottom and a white hood. Red or yellow bottoms with white tops were also offered. Sometimes bicycle accessories were added, e.g. squeeze <b>bulb</b> <b>horn</b> and a rear view mirror.|$|R
5000|$|Raposo was {{an ardent}} fan of satirical {{composer}} and bandleader Spike Jones. [...] "The Alligator Song", which Raposo composed for 1970s-era Sesame Street, was Raposo's sound-effects-laden musical homage to Jones. Raposo also composed numerous other works influenced by Jones for Sesame Street, many featuring kazoo and other comical sound-effect objects and instruments like siren whistles, <b>bulb</b> <b>horns,</b> and tenor banjos. Another Raposo composition, [...] "Doggy Paddle", features Raposo barking like several singing dogs during its instrumental verse, a blatant musical {{homage to the}} singing and barking dogs of [...] "Memories are Made of This" [...] by Jones and His City Slickers.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{models were}} produced, the 'Standard model' which had {{acetylene}} lighting and <b>bulb</b> <b>horn,</b> priced in 1930 at £57/10/6 and the 'De Luxe model' which had electric lighting and instrument panel, priced in 1930 at £63/2/6. In 1931 both were designated A/2 and minor changes included a four speed gearbox with improved gear ratios with lower 1st and higher top gear {{and a more}} rounded petrol tank, the Amal carburettor jet was changed from 70 to 55 and {{the diameter of the}} exhaust pipe was increased with ports on the head spaced further apart (65/8" [...] instead of 51/8").|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of foot lameness in a dairy herd of 170 goats is described. The herd, that was kept mostly indoors, was attended between December 2006 and November 2007. During this period, 15 % of the goats showed lameness with foot lesions and 24 % of the goats showed lameness without foot lesions. The foot lesions consisted of cracks and erosions on the <b>horn</b> of the <b>bulbs</b> of the heel {{that in most}} cases extended along the internal side of the axial hoof wall. The clinical diagnosis was interdigital dermatitis Annual. milk production was lower in lame goats compared to those that were not lame (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, annual milk yield was significantly affected {{by the type of}} foot disease present and was significantly lower in cases with foot lesions than in the animals that were not lame (P< 0. 05) and also in the lame goats without foot lesions (P< 0. 05).

500|$|The EP {{features}} the titular parody, {{as well as}} three original comedy songs, with music written by Yankovic. In April 1980, Yankovic recorded the first song for the album, [...] "Gotta Boogie". The song, co-written by Joe Earley, is a play on words discussing {{a man with a}} [...] "boogie" [...] on his finger and his quandary therein. The second song to be recorded for the EP was [...] "Another One Rides the Bus", on September 14, 1980. Yankovic wrote the song, a parody of Queen's hit [...] "Another One Bites the Dust", and debuted it live on the Dr. Demento Show, hosted by Barret [...] "Dr. Demento" [...] Hansen. While practicing the song outside the sound booth, Yankovic met Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz who told Yankovic he was a drummer. Schwartz agreed to drum on Yankovic's accordion case to keep a steady beat to the song. [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] became so popular that it landed Yankovic a short-lived record deal with TK Records, and also led to his first appearance on a TV show, The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion and Schwartz banged on Yankovic's accordion case and played the <b>bulb</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Trained seals would honk out “How Dry I Am” {{on a set}} of <b>bulb</b> <b>horns,</b> {{and several}} times a day, {{dolphins}} would rescue a clown named [...] "Flippy". The show featured James H. Crovetti, Sr., as Flippy the Clown. The Master of Ceremonies would call out, “Flippy, where are you?” The spotlights would come on and there was Flippy the Clown, hanging 40 feet above the waters of the Aquarama’s indoor arena pool, hanging from a scaffolding he would roll out from the back wall where the holding tanks that the dolphins were kept in were located.. Flippy would throw down various items such as rings, balls, and toys that the dolphins would balance on their noses. At the end of this segment of the show, the Master of Ceremonies would shout, “OK Flippy, come on down, but be very careful!” Flippy would push back the scaffolding, he would pretend to forget to let go of one of the hand bars used to push back the scaffolding leaving him hanging 40 feet above the waters of the main show tank! He would hang there for at least 2 minutes interacting with the Master of Ceremonies saying “Hang on Flippy, we're coming to get you!” Flippy would let go making the 40-foot plunge into the tank feet first so that his flippers would create the biggest splash possible. The dolphins would rescue Flippy. There was no belly flop! He would do this dangerous trick 4 times a day. Attractive young women would swim in the tank(s) to appear like mermaids and entertain the curiosity of the visitors. As lights went on at show time six porpoises, each weighing about 300 pounds and 10 ft long would start in a [...] "Philly" [...] style dance version of the [...] "Twist" [...] made popular by home town recording star Chubby Checker. Philadelphia radio and TV personality Gene Arnold hosted many shows there, as did the later [...] "Voice of the Flyers," [...] Gene Hart.|$|R
