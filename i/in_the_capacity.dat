He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations for the sport in Asbestos. He had a local tournament named after him in this sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann.

5|$|In 1842, Kaʻauwai {{was elected}} by the Hawaiian {{legislature}} to serve {{as one of the}} four Assistant Judges of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, the first formed in the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1842 and 1848, which was headed by King Kamehameha III and the Kuhina Nui Kekāuluohi and after her death Keoni Ana. These four judges of the Supreme Court were not Associate Justices (like later individuals appointed after 1848) but served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> of an assistant to the Chief Justice, i.e. the King. He sat as a judge from 1842 to 1846, before resigning in November, 1846. He was succeeded by Joshua Kaʻeo. In 1842, King Kamehameha III also appointed Kaʻauwai as one of the five original members of the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles, a government committee in charge of settling or quieting land claims of the Great Māhele.

Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns.

5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, {{three months before the}} planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E

5|$|The regular main {{composer}} for the Tales {{series is}} Motoi Sakuraba.

Sakuraba has become noted for his signature musical style, which {{is present in the}} majority of his Tales scores. He also frequently collaborates with Shinji Tamura. The entries Sakuraba has not worked on are Legendia, which was composed by Go Shiina, an in-house composer, and Innocence, whose composer was Kazuhiro Nakamura. Sakuraba and Shiina had collaborated on the score for Zestiria. Multiple titles in the series use licensed theme songs by multiple Japanese artists: among the artists are Garnet Crow (Eternia), Deen (Destiny/Hearts), Kokia (Innocence), Ayumi Hamasaki (Xillia/Xillia 2) and FLOW (Berseria). One recurring aspect of many earlier localizations was the removal of the Japanese theme song, such as with Symphonia, which had its theme song replaced with an orchestral version. The first western release of a Tales title to feature the theme song used in Japan was Vesperia.|$|E
5|$|The site of CenturyLink Field is the {{smallest}} of those developed for new NFL stadiums. The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space.

Traditionally, appointees to the DG position {{have come from the}} Indian Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry Coast Guard officer. While several previous Directors General have come from the Coast Guard stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P. Paleri – they have all initially been commissioned into the Indian Navy before later being permanently deputed to the Coast Guard service. As such, Singh has the distinction of being the first regular direct entry officer of the Indian Coast Guard to be promoted to the position of ADG and to achieve three-star rank, doing so on 11 January 2013. He was later appointed as the DG, taking over this position in early 2016. Singh succeeded Vice Admiral H. C. S. Bisht on 1 March 2016.

5|$|From 1277, Stratton acted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> as Countess Isabella's steward, {{though he}} never officially used that title. It was in this post that he {{committed}} {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and the box was sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E
