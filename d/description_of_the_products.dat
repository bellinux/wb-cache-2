40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to characterise all the {{possible}} Ces�aro and L-asymptotic limits of powerbounded, complex matrices. The investigation of the L-asymptotic limit of a powerbounded operator goes back to Sz. -Nagy and it shows how the orbit of a vector behaves with respect to the powers. It turns out that the two types of asymptotic limits coincide for every powerbounded matrix and a special case is connected to the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> SS� where S runs through those invertible matrices which have unit columnvectors. We also show that for any powerbounded operator acting on an arbitrary complex Hilbert space the norm of the L-asymptotic limit is greater than or equal to 1, unless it is zero; moreover, the same is true for the Ces�aro asymptotic limit of a not necessarily powerbounded operator, if it exists...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{approach}} to calculating the cup and cap products on Hochschild cohomology and homology of curved algebras associated with polynomials and their finite abelian symmetry groups. For polynomials with isolated critical points, the approach yields a complete <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products.</b> We also reformulate the result for the corresponding categories of equivariant matrix factorizations. In an Appendix written jointly with Alexey Basalaev, we apply the formulas to calculate the Hochschild cohomology of a simple but non-trivial class of so-called invertible LG orbifold models. The resulting algebras {{turn out to be}} isomorphic to what has already appeared in the literature on LG mirror symmetry under the name of twisted or orbifolded Milnor/Jacobian algebras. We conjecture that this holds true for all invertible LG models. In {{the second part of the}} Appendix, the formulas are applied to a different class of LG orbifolds which have appeared in the context of homological mirror symmetry for varieties of general type as mirror partners of surfaces of genus 2 and higher. In combination with a homological mirror symmetry theorem for the surfaces, our calculation yields a new proof of the fact that the Hochschild cohomology of the Fukaya category of a surface is isomorphic, as an algebra, to the cohomology of the surface.

40|$|To {{cope with}} the rapidly {{increasing}} volume and complexity of data being generated by ESO’s public optical/infrared imaging surveys a high-performance, end-to-end survey software system has been developed. Its main aim {{is to provide a}} robust framework to efficiently transform raw data into science-grade survey products. The system consists of several tasks wrapped together into an integrated framework. These tasks in-clude: the un-supervised reduction of optical/infrared images generated by different imagers, the astrometric and photometric calibration of the data, the creation of image stacks and mosaics, the preparation of catalogs and the selection of different targets of potential interest for spectroscopic follow-up. Since the data are meant to be public, the system also provides an extensive <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> and the required information for users to assess their quality. The system has been designed to enable a small group to monitor the un-supervised reduction and analysis of data from multiple surveys in their entirety – from survey definition all the way through to the release of comprehensively documented survey products (stacked images, mosaics and catalogs) – all done by one operator from a single desktop. While originally designed for handling survey data, the system can also be used as a general front-end to ESO’s raw data archive, and as such serve as a site-specific interface to the general VO infra-structure. In this contribution the system is briefly described. 1...|$|E

Our approach is based on a partnership including two laboratories one dedicated to Computer sciences (LORIA) and one dedicated to Educational sciences (LISEC), the pedagogical engineering department of the University of Lorraine (NUTICE), the department for student employability of the University of Lorraine and the Regional Council of Lorraine. Our approach is based on a two complementary axis. Based on previous works which have shown the need to study the real uses of all the target users (students, professionals, integration agencies, [...] .), the first axis is devoted to the pedagogical aspects and it will focus on : - the analysis of the learning process of the students (formal, informal and non formal learning, social activities, [...] .), - the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> i. e. how do students exploit the ePortfolio in their professional insertion strategy - the link with the strategy of the Regional Council of Lorraine.

40|$|International audienceThe {{customisation}} of {{a vehicle}} on a production line results from the assembly of several hundreds of alternative components. Bills of Material (BOM) are usually made for operational purposes (to define the list of components to be assembled on a vehicle), for planning (to anticipate component procurement needs) and for commercial needs (guide customer choice and prepare sales forecasts). In the automotive industry, the diversity of end products which results from this combinatorial process (several millions) is such as no solution proposed in the literature allows to easily list the BOMs for all these vehicles. In our paper, we describe and theorise a solution used for many years by several carmakers, which consists in introducing a commercial <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> {{in addition to their}} common organic representation. We show that this solution is an extension of the generic and modular BOM theory, recognised to be the most advanced solutions proposed in the literature. While fully meeting commercial and production control needs, this product description paradigm has limitations when it comes to determining the Master Production Schedules (MPS) at end product level beyond the frozen horizon, as performed by several automakers. An alternative approach defining MPSs at alternative component level is proposed in the literature. However, this approach also has several drawbacks that we point out. To overcome these issues, we propose a number of possible strategic and organisational tracks of improvement...|$|E
