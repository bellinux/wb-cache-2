Common price setting strategies such as auctions, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> and spot markets may be of help. To administer a long term stability for an operator, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can be entered. These <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> should be valid for several years but still not consume too much capacity from other operators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} interviews with social care service development managers and brokers in three local authorities. It follows {{an earlier study}} exploring choice and flexibility in home care services for older people using council-managed personal budgets. That study found that local authorities were {{limiting the number of}} providers on <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> for home care services so that there were sufficient to encourage competition but not so many that providers risked having insufficient business to remain financially viable. It also found that communication issues were affecting the proper functioning of brokerage systems. The current study therefore revisited the same three local authorities to investigate changes in <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> and developments in brokerage systems. The findings showed little change in the number of providers on <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> and remaining communication challenges for brokers. However, lessons had been learned from unforeseen consequences of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements,</b> and progress was being made towards encouraging market development and diversification of service provision...|$|R

40|$|Context of this research: The {{construction}} industry {{has a history}} of client dissatisfaction in the UK. In response, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> have been developed to create relationships between suppliers and clients in order to improve project performance. This research aims to assess whether use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can result in significant improvement for performance outcomes without a significant increase in costs when compared with traditional discrete methods, and if so, develop a procurement performance model for realisation and continuous improvement in performance. Research methodology: A literal review of UK Government reports with economic and performance management theories precede a case study set within Hampshire County Council, a major public sector authority, allowing analysis of data from 164 highway maintenance projects by independent samples t-tests. Projects are divided into discrete and framework groups using critical success factors to measure performance differences. In addition to project outcomes, a review of economic performance was undertaken to advance a current ‘gap in professional knowledge’ concerning cost effectiveness of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements.</b> A performance management model is proposed representing impact of operational measures and sociological behaviour factors on suppliers’ performance, tested by qualitative views of experienced practitioners collected through a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. Key findings: Independent-samples t-tests proved that there were significant improvements in performance with use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements,</b> but that no significant additional costs were incurred. Factor analysis and central tendency statistics from questionnaires and node values from interview transcripts confirmed long-term relationships, financial and non–financial incentives and stronger communication were sociological behaviour factors driving performance for <b>framework</b> <b>agreements.</b> Conclusions from the evidence and findings: As <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can achieve significant performance improvements without a significant increase in costs, this study supports use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> for Hampshire County Council and professional practice. Value of this research is recognised by both central government and case study organisation alike. In respect of the latter context, case study findings have been included within a regional framework for use by South East authorities until 2016. It is recommended further studies should be conducted on civil and building projects in wider public and private sectors so that construction clients can make informed decisions based upon generalised findings...|$|R
