6000|$|... 'What {{was that}} you said?' asked Mrs. Boulte. 'Never mind that man. What did Ted say to you? What did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> What {{did he say to}} you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was always}} arrogant and always hard. I can {{remember}} her just the same; {{but that was}} so many years ago. She left Bragton then because she could not banish his mother from the house. But to bear it all in her heart so long is not like a human being,--let alone a woman. What did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> going home yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{what the}} disciple named Thomas asked--an' {{he was a}} very doubting {{follower}} of Jesus, like too many of us. The Master said <b>to</b> him what <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and me, `I am the way and the truth and the life; no one cometh unto the Father but by me.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Suppose that <b>you</b> were <b>to</b> die {{today and}} stand before God and <b>he</b> were <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> [...] "Why should I let you into my heaven?" [...] {{what would you}} say? ...|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. Yes, that is {{just what}} <b>he</b> will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> (Vacantly.) It doesn't matter: I shall never see either of you again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my friend," [...] he said, [...] "look me in {{the face}} and answer me this question. You know little of us Democrats as a party. You see nothing but a hotchpotch of strange people, {{struggling}} and striving to attain definite form. Naturally you are full of prejudices. Yet consider your own political position. I am not here to make capital out of a man's disappointment in his friends, but has your great patron used you well? Horlock offers you a grudging and belated place in his Cabinet. What did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when you came hack from Hellesfield?" [...] Tallente was silent. There was, in fact, no answer which he could make. [...] "I do not wish to dwell on that," [...] Dartrey went on. [...] "Ingratitude is the natural sequence of the distorted political ideals which we are out to destroy. You should be in the frame of mind, Tallente, to see things clearly. You must realise the rotten condition of the political party to which Horlock belongs--the Coalitionists, the Whip, or whatever they like to call themselves. The government of this country since the war has been a farce and a mockery. We are dropping behind in the world's race. Labour fattens with sops, develops a spirit of greed and production languishes. You know why. Labour would toil for its country, Labour can feel patriotism with the best, but Labour hates to toil under the earth, upon the earth, and in the factories of the world {{for the sake of the}} profiteer. This is the national spirit, that jealousy, that slackness, which the last ten years has developed. There is a new Little Englander abroad and he speaks with the voice of Labour. It is our task to find the soul of the people. And I have come to you for your aid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see--it was {{the only}} way to avoid a tete-a-tete!' said Albinia. 'Well done, Genevieve. What had <b>he</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my dear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did not advise him. I {{only said}} that I {{had been talking}} to her about it. If <b>he</b> were <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> had been recommending my mother to do this or that, you would not take it amiss?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I think <b>you</b> {{are going}} <b>to</b> get well. The doctor <b>'e</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> let <b>you</b> see you' money the first thing. Shall I put it hon you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] {{returned}} Mrs Langley, with a laugh. [...] "I {{forgot that}} he was absent when you arrived. You will find that <b>he</b> understands all <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him, though I'm not quite sure that you will understand all <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Like {{some of the other}} Moors here, he has been in the British navy, and has acquired a knowledge of English. You'll find him a pleasant companion, I doubt not. Be so good as to tell him that I wish to see him before he leaves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Savant {{was asked}} the {{following}} question in her September 9, 1990 column: Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> [...] "Do <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> pick door #2?" [...] Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors? Craig F. Whitaker, Columbia, Maryland ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly what I predicted," [...] said Mr. Clare. [...] "Don't {{interrupt}} me {{by making}} explanations; and don't frighten the cat. If {{there is anything}} {{to eat in the}} kitchen, get it and go <b>to</b> bed. <b>You</b> can walk over to Combe-Raven tomorrow and give this message from me to Mr. Vanstone: 'Father's compliments, sir, and I have come back upon your hands like a bad shilling, as he always said I should. He keeps his own guinea, and takes your five; and he hopes you'll mind what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> another time.' That is the message. Shut the door after you. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What has <b>he</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Nina?" [...] {{the girl}} asked, taking {{hold of her}} friend's dress, to prevent her escape into the street. [...] "You need not be in a hurry for a minute. He will not come down." ...|$|R
60|$|Note {{here two}} things. First, that St. Paul {{says that we}} really receive Christ in the Holy Communion. <b>He</b> does not <b>say,</b> as some do, that the Communion is merely a remembrance of Christ's death. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that the {{faithful}} verily and indeed receive Christ's body and blood in the Sacrament. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> so, distinctly, plainly, literally; and if that be not true, his whole argument goes for nothing, and will not stand. The Jews, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> drank of the spiritual Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Christ; and so <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But that did not save them from the punishment of their sins, when they went and sinned afresh: neither will it save you.|$|R
60|$|Q. Still, I don't {{understand}} it at all. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> spoke <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and that he}} was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do, Mr. Philander; {{but while}} {{we all love}} him, you alone are best fitted to manage him; for, {{regardless}} of what <b>he</b> may <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> respects your great learning, and, therefore, has immense confidence in your judgment. The poor dear cannot differentiate between erudition and wisdom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am terrified," [...] she said. [...] "Monsieur {{must come}} to my apartments one afternoon, where we can talk without fear. There is one more question, though," [...] she {{continued}} rapidly. [...] "Louis looked often at us. Tell me, did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about Monsieur Bartot and myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} had met again, and what you had come home for, and I told your father so, when <b>he</b> came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deeply sincere. He {{has said}} to me the most appreciative, the most charming things about her. <b>He</b> would <b>say</b> them <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if <b>he</b> were sure <b>you</b> would listen <b>to</b> him--gently." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{and he is}} a man, and, {{like most}} men, very dumb when they have {{anything}} at heart which requires care in the speaking.

6000|$|RAMSDEN. Oh, {{that was}} his partiality: we were very old friends, you know. But there was {{something}} else <b>he</b> used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about <b>you.</b> I wonder whether I ought <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> or not! ...|$|R

I cannot describe it--you will see for yourself. And it has all seemed to happen so suddenly. As I wrote you, he sat up both nights, with Preston--he could not be induced to leave the room. And after the first night he was different. He has hardly spoken a word, except when he sent for me this evening, and he eats nothing.... And yet, somehow, I do not think that this will be the end.

First, to {{see whether}} they have oil in their lamps or not; that is, to search and see, whether the Spirit of the Man Christ Jesus be in them or no; for he that hath not the Spirit of Christ in him, is none of Christ's (Rom 8:9).
