5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E

25|$|Deception {{in animals}} is the {{transmission}} of misinformation by one animal to another, of the same or different species, {{in a way that}} propagates beliefs that are not true.

25|$|It {{has also}} been noted that iTunes <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> track changes to actual files in the library.

Several third party tools address this problem.|$|E
25|$|In Austria, {{since the}} 1st of April 2013, {{marriage}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> change a woman's name; therefore a name change {{can only take}} place upon legal application.

25|$|Perimenopause is {{a natural}} stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and {{emotional}} effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt {{the life of the}} woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Three wheeled {{motorcycles}} {{without the}} ability to lean have {{no need to be}} countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers like a car.|$|E
25|$|Eichmann's {{defense lawyer}} argued that Israel {{did not have}} {{jurisdiction}} on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Vice President of the United States, {{the deputy}} prime {{minister}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> assume the office of prime minister if the incumbent of the latter office dies or resigns. Although {{he or she would}} become the acting prime minister on a temporary caretaker basis to ensure continuity of government function during the immediate period of transition, the {{deputy prime minister}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> become the new permanent prime minister: constitutional convention actually requires the governor general to consult the governing party regarding the permanent succession, and to call on a member of that party's caucus to assume the prime ministership. No policy or convention precludes the deputy prime minister from being chosen as the new prime minister in such a scenario, but none assures it, either—the party caucus would be free to recommend any new leader of its choice to the governor general. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the governor general is expected to follow the wishes of the party, although officially he or she retains the authority to make the final decision. That being the case, no Prime Minister has died in office or resigned suddenly (except following his or her party's electoral defeat) since the 1890s, many decades before the office of Deputy Prime Minister was created.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the formula}} of the London Declaration, Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of the Commonwealth, a title {{that is by}} law a part of Elizabeth's royal titles {{in each of the}} Commonwealth realms, the 16 members of the Commonwealth that {{recognise}} the Queen as their monarch. However, when the monarch dies, the successor to the crown <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> become Head of the Commonwealth. The position is symbolic, representing the free association of independent members, the majority of which (31) are republics, and five have monarchs of different royal houses (Brunei, Lesotho, Malaysia, Swaziland, and Tonga).|$|E
25|$|If a tableau {{calculus}} is complete, every unsatisfiable set of formulae has {{an associated}} closed tableau. While this tableau {{can always be}} obtained by applying some {{of the rules of}} the calculus, the problem of which rules to apply for a given formula still remains. As a result, completeness <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> imply the existence of a feasible policy of application of rules that always leads to a closed tableau for every given unsatisfiable set of formulae. While a fair proof procedure is complete for ground tableau and tableau without unification, {{this is not the case}} for tableau with unification.|$|E
25|$|In {{the provinces}} of Canada, the deputy premier also <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>automatically</b> succeed {{to the office of}} premier {{in the event of a}} sudden {{resignation}} or death. Unlike at the federal level, however, there have been instances where the governing party recommended that the deputy premier serve as premier on an interim basis until a permanent successor was chosen—most notably, Dan Miller ascended from the deputy premiership to the premiership of British Columbia in 1999, following the resignation of Glen Clark, and Kathy Dunderdale ascended from the deputy premiership to the premiership of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2010, following the resignation of Danny Williams.|$|E
