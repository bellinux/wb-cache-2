High levels of pollution seem likely to have affected larger invertebrates, consequently reducing the sediment disturbance that they generate. In contrast, an influx of novel PCBs would tend to facilitate re-arrangements that would transfer previously accreted PCBs to higher levels in the sediment structure. At the same time, hydrocarbon chains should degrade, leading to a new distribution with shorter chains and a shift of the peak to C 23.|$|E

40|$|Mycoplasma haemofelis {{infection}} frequently causes anemia in cats. Despite {{an intense}} immune response and/or antibiotic treatment, cats often remain asymptomatic carriers <b>following</b> infection. <b>Our</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that detection of antibodies to M. haemofelis is a sensitive approach for identifying infected cats, particularly carriers. To date, no immunoassay has been developed. This is {{due largely to}} the inability to culture M. haemofelis in vitro; hence, a source of antigen is not readily available. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify, express, and purify immunogenic proteins of M. haemofelis. To accomplish this, two whole-genomic expression libraries were created in the Lambda ZapII vector and immunoscreened with preimmune plasma, plasma from specific-pathogen-free cats, and pooled acute- and convalescent-phase plasma from experimentally infected cats. The inserts from 21 immunoreactive clones were sequenced, resulting in the identification of 60 genes coding for putative proteins necessary for diverse cellular functions, along with several novel genes of M. haemofelis. Fragments of selected genes based on bioinformatic analyses were PCR amplified, cloned into a high-level protein expression system, and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli as a His 6 -fusion protein. The recombinant fusion proteins of M. haemofelis were purified and evaluated as an antigen in a Western blot to verify the findings of previous immunoscreening.

40|$|Pantetheine, a low {{molecular}} weight thiol, {{has been found to}} ameliorate symptoms in various disease models but specifically in Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN). Pantetheine is usually administered in its disulfide form (i. e. pantethine) since pantethine is commercially available and is reduced to pantetheine in biological systems. The applicability and efficacy of pantethine (therefore also pantetheine) as a clinical therapeutic however is hampered since both forms can be degraded by pantetheinases present in the body. Here, we report the synthesis of a masked form of pantetheine, namely 4 -thiobutyltriphenylphosphonium-pantetheine (TBTP-pantetheine), <b>following</b> <b>our</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that this pantetheine-derivative might be more stable in the presence of pantetheinases than pantetheine itself. Higher stability would enhance transport into the cytoplasm where TBTP-pantetheine is metabolized into pantetheine which can subsequently execute its medicinal action. We find that TBTP-pantetheine is stable in aqueous solution, however it was found to be less stable in 10 % fetal calf serum (which contains pantetheinases) compared to pantethine, the commercially availabile disulfide of pantetheine.

40|$|Através deste trabalho, pretendemos analisar o poema Beowulf e sua importância na sociedade da Inglaterra anglo-saxônica, em especial no que se refere às imagens aristocráticas e régias. Estabelecemos paralelos das personagens encontradas no poema e demais referencias do corpo poético anglo-saxão, com o quadro sócio-{{cultural}} do momento tendo por foco o período chamado em nossa pesquisa por período alfrediano. Segundo nossa hipótese, teria sido dentro deste período (final do século VIII e início do século XI) que provavelmente Beowulf teria sido composto, assim como outras obras de cunho heróico. A idéia central seria de que tais obras teriam uma finalidade modelar para a aristocracia guerreira durante o momento da reconquista dos territórios ocupados pelos escandinavos desde o início das primeiras invasões. Assim, as imagens encontradas nessas obras e em especial Beowulf, estariam espelhando um ideal aristocrático germânico, mas profundamente influenciado pela tradição cristã. Desta forma, o que teremos será uma produção poética incentivada pela ascensão da Casa de Wessex (iniciada pelo rei Alfred, o Grande) que irá refletir o ideário germânico de glória e honra unido a elementos cristão, principalmente do Velho Testamento. Ao reforçar tais elementos, o período alfrediano estabeleceria um modelo aristocrático e régio, tendo o poema Beowulf como um reflexo desta retomada cultural numa Inglaterra pré-conquista normandaWith this work, {{we intend}} to study the Beowulf poem and its importance on Anglo-Saxon society, mainly about the kingship and aristocratic images. We established some parallels {{of what could be}} found in the poem and other references of the Anglo-Saxon poetic staff, with the socio-cultural scenario of the age keeping on focus the moment that we call alfredian period. <b>Following</b> <b>our</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> it would have been on this period (end of 8 th century and early 11 th century) that Beowulf would have been composed, as other works of heroic style. The central idea is that such works had the purpose {{to be a role model}} to the warrior-aristocracy in a moment of reconquering of the territories occupied by the Scandinavians since the beginning of the invasions. So, the images found on this kind of work, and specially Beowulf, would have been a resemblance of a Germanic aristocratic ideal, but deeply influenced by the Christian tradition. With this in mind, what we have are a poetic enterprise supported by the ascension of the House of Wessex (started by king Alfred, the Great) which will reflect the Germanic ideal of glory and honor joined with Christian elements, mainly from the Old Testament. With the stressing of this elements, the Alfredian period would established an aristocratic and kingly model, having the Beowulf poem as a sign of this cultural renascence on an England before the Norman conquest...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} quantum probability theory for ranking documents. Quantum probability theory is used to estimate the probability of relevance of a document given a user's query. We posit that quantum probability theory {{can lead to a}} better estimation of the probability of a document being relevant to a user's query than the common approach, i. e. the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP), which is based upon Kolmogorovian probability theory. <b>Following</b> <b>our</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> we formulate an analogy between the document retrieval scenario and a physical scenario, that of the double slit experiment. Through the analogy, we propose a novel ranking approach, the quantum probability ranking principle (qPRP). Key to our proposal is the presence of quantum interference. Mathematically, this is the statistical deviation between empirical observations and expected values predicted by the Kolmogorovian rule of additivity of probabilities of disjoint events in configurations such that of the double slit experiment. We propose an interpretation of quantum interference in the document ranking scenario, and examine how quantum interference can be effectively estimated for document retrieval. To validate our proposal and to gain more insights about approaches for document ranking, we (1) analyse PRP, qPRP and other ranking approaches, exposing the assumptions underlying their ranking criteria and formulating the conditions for the optimality of the two ranking principles, (2) empirically compare three ranking principles (i. e. PRP, interactive PRP, and qPRP) and two state-of-the-art ranking strategies in two retrieval scenarios, those of ad-hoc retrieval and diversity retrieval, (3) analytically contrast the ranking criteria of the examined approaches, exposing similarities and differences, (4) study the ranking behaviours of approaches alternative to PRP in terms of the kinematics they impose on relevant documents, i. e. by considering the extent and direction of the movements of relevant documents across the ranking recorded when comparing PRP against its alternatives. Our findings show that the effectiveness of the examined ranking approaches strongly depends upon the evaluation context. In the traditional evaluation context of ad-hoc retrieval, PRP is empirically shown to be better or comparable to alternative ranking approaches. However, when we turn to examine evaluation contexts that account for interdependent document relevance (i. e. when the relevance of a document is assessed also with respect to other retrieved documents, as it is the case in the diversity retrieval scenario) then the use of quantum probability theory and thus of qPRP is shown to improve retrieval and ranking effectiveness over the traditional PRP and alternative ranking strategies, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance, Portfolio theory, and Interactive PRP. This work represents a significant step forward regarding the use of quantum theory in information retrieval. It demonstrates in fact that the application of quantum theory to problems within information retrieval can lead to improvements both in modelling power and retrieval effectiveness, allowing the constructions of models that capture the complexity of information retrieval situations. Furthermore, the thesis opens up a number of lines for future research. These include (1) investigating estimations and approximations of quantum interference in qPRP, (2) exploiting complex numbers for the representation of documents and queries, and (3) applying the concepts underlying qPRP to tasks other than document ranking.

40|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain why female birds either copulate repeatedly with a single mate or copulate with multiple partners even though only a single copulation may be sufficient to fertilize an entire clutch. We hypothesize that females may directly benefit from high frequencies of copulation and multiple copulation partners if they receive a cloacal inoculation of beneficial sexually transmitted microbes (STMs) that can either protect them against future encounters with pathogens and/or serve as therapy against present infections. Experiments in domestic animal production, wildlife rehabilitation, and clinical medicine indicate that inoculations of beneficial microbes derived from the indigenous microflora of hosts can lead to nutritional benefits, resistance to colonization by pathogens, the elimination of infection, and improved immune system functioning in recipients. <b>Our</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts greater copulatory rates when the probability of the transmission of beneficial microbes exceeds that of pathogens and when {{the positive effects of}} beneficial microbes on host fitness exceed the negative effects of pathogens.

Results from recent studies have shown a tendency towards improvement of the functional outcomes with use of an articulated external fixator during the postoperative period <b>following</b> multiligament reconstruction. <b>Our</b> <b>hypothesis</b> was that good knee stability and early gain of range of motion could be achieved with the use of the external fixator after ligament reconstructions. MethodsFourteen patients with knee dislocations were evaluated after multiligament reconstruction in association with use of a lateral monoplanar external fixator for six weeks. Reconstructions were performed using grafts from a tissue bank. Range of motion was measured after one, two, three, six, twelve months and at the final evaluation at a mean time of 49 months. The assessments were made using objective and subjective IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scales. ResultsThe mean scores were 71. 7 for the subjective IKDC score, 81. 5 for the Lysholm score. No patient was able to return to previous Tegner score. Out of the 45 ligament reconstructions performed, only four failed during the follow-up time. The mean range of motion of the knee presented a progressive increase from the first to the twelfth month, from 67. 8 ° to 115. 7 °. Two cases of superficial infection on the site of the external fixator pins were observed. ConclusionThe use of an external fixator enabled early rehabilitation with range of motion gains starting from the first postoperative month, a low rate of reconstruction failure and minimal complications. Nevertheless, none of the patients returned to the level of activity prevailing prior to the injury. Level of evidenceLevel IV, retrospective therapeutic case series...|$|R
