5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> and only among the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.|$|E

M protein-producing strains of group A streptococci did not adhere <b>in</b> significantly <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> than M-negative strains. Lipoteichoic acid inhibited binding of streptococci to skin epithelial cells {{as well as}} was previously shown for oral epithelial cells. Our results suggest that lipoteichoic acid is more centrally involved than M protein in binding streptococci to skin and mucosal surfaces...|$|R
5|$|The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but can happen <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> to exhausted adults after large storms, an event {{known as a}} wreck, where they provide prized sightings for birders.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Australian {{military}} {{was reinforced by}} units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of the}} CMF and RAAF. United States Military units also arrived in Australia <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> before being deployed to New Guinea. The Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943.

5|$|Many hybrid {{zones are}} known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are {{continually}} produced <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers.</b> These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems {{for studying the}} mechanisms of speciation. Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the North West Territories confirmed the existence of naturally-occurring and fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> {{but it was never}} updated. The celestial globe was up to date in using the information provided by Copernicus.|$|E

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers.</b> It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> just five hours later.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1942 the Australian {{military}} {{was reinforced by}} units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of the}} Militia and RAAF. United States military units also arrived in Australia <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian {{military was}} mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight over and over again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E
5|$|Winnebago {{intermittently}} bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines {{until they}} surrendered, on 24 and 6 August, respectively. On {{the night of}} 8 August, Commander Stevens sent a boat crew {{under the command of}} Acting Ensign Michael Murphy on a successful mission to cut the telegraph cable between Fort Morgan and the city of Mobile. The fort surrendered on 24 August and the ship remained at Mobile Bay into 1865 supporting Union forces. On 27 March, Union forces advanced on Spanish Fort as the first step in capturing Mobile. The Navy's role was to bombard the defenses and to interdict their communications with Mobile, but the defenders had sown mines <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers</b> in the waterways. The Navy successfully swept many of these, but could not completely clear the rivers.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>numbers.</b> By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
