40|$|This {{paper will}} review recent {{developments}} in slip ring and fiber optic rotary joint (FORJ) technology for the transmission of high-speed data on military vehicles. Computer systems that control military vehicles are incorporating Local Area Network (LAN) based architectures. In addition there is an increased sophistication in systems such as Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and vehicle navigation technologies. These changes are pushing the data rates in vehicle systems higher. Vehicle systems that traditionally ran on 1553 data buses of 1 Mbit/sec now require aggregate data rates of 1. 0 + Gbit/sec. To accomplish these data speeds, system designers are integrating high-speed copper and fiber optic transmission lines into their <b>harness</b> <b>assemblies.</b> There are two areas on vehicles where circuits carrying high-speed data must transfer across rotating surfaces: (1) turrets and (2) gimbaled sensor systems, such as infrared and visible video. Slip rings have traditionally been used to transfer data, power, and control signals across these rotating interfaces. New technologies are enabling slip rings to carry higher speed data {{than they have in}} the past. Fiber optic data transmission across rotary interfaces has been accomplished with fiber optic rotary joints (FORJ). In addition to the performance of slip rings and FORJ’s, this paper will review alternative technologies for transmitting data across rotary interfaces. Techniques for multiplexing circuits through the rotating interface will be discussed which allow a single fiber or electrical line to accommodate several high-speed data circuits...|$|R

30|$|Since the 1990 s, {{many studies}} have tested VM and {{proposed}} a number of solutions. Caudell and Mizell proved the effectiveness of using a VR system to provide instructions for wiring <b>harness</b> <b>assembly</b> (Caudell and Mizell 1992). Real-time immersive virtual environments (VEs), such as the Workbench (Cutler et al. 2010) and the CAVE (Cruzneira et al. 1993) {{have been used to}} assess the maintainability of virtual prototypes. Such environments are part of a more complex VR system (Fern et al. 2002) that supports assembly and disassembly operations in immersive VEs. Compared with the object-oriented prototype system called V-REALISM for maintenance training proposed by Qing-Hui and Li (2006), a better solution has been presented by Abate et al. (2009), which combines VR techniques and haptic interaction to simulate process of product assembly maintenance in the aerospace industry. VM systems have been applied in maintenance process simulation (De Sa and Zachmann 1999), maintenance planning (Van Houten and Kimura 2000), and maintenance training (Leino et al. 2009). Christiand et al. (2009) proposed a novel assembly optimization framework based on genetic algorithm; this framework allows the determination of an optimal plan for maintenance processes by following an optimal assembly sequence and by considering factors in path planning. A 3 D real-time simulation system for the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) remote maintenance analysis has been applied to the blanket maintenance manipulator (Esque et al. 2007; Carlo et al. 2009; Cock et al. 2009; Elzendoorn et al. 2009). Amos et al. (2008) have established a machine service support system that demonstrates advanced use of 3 D graphical simulation tools in the resource domain, and expends the use of simulation modules from the system design and development phase into operation phase. Bourdot et al. (2008) presented an approach for integrating VR and computer-aided design (CAD), allowing intuitive and direct 3 D edition on CAD objects within VEs. More researched models, such as the maintainability evaluation model (Chen and Cai 2003), optimal maintenance policies in incomplete repair models (Kahle 2007), effective visualization model (Tang et al. 2006), and some research have study virtual ergonomics.

40|$|Resistive {{switches}} are a {{class of}} emerging nanoelectronics devices that exhibit {{a wide variety of}} switching characteristics closely resembling behaviors of biological synapses. Assembled into random networks, such resistive switches produce emerging behaviors far more complex than that of individual devices. This was previously demonstrated in simulations that exploit information processing within these random networks to solve tasks that require nonlinear computation as well as memory. Physical assemblies of such networks manifest complex spatial structures and basic processing capabilities often related to biologically-inspired computing. We model and simulate random resistive switch networks and analyze their computational capacities. We provide a detailed discussion of the relevant design parameters and establish the link to the physical assemblies by relating the modeling parameters to physical parameters. More globally connected networks and an increased network switching activity are means to increase the computational capacity linearly at the expense of exponentially growing energy consumption. We discuss a new modular approach that exhibits higher computational capacities and energy consumption growing linearly with the number of networks used. The results show how to optimize the trade-off between computational capacity and energy efficiency and are relevant for the design and fabrication of novel computing architectures that <b>harness</b> random <b>assemblies</b> of emerging nanodevices...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCapping protein (CP) is an {{integral}} component of Arp 2 / 3 -nucleated actin networks that drive amoeboid motility. Increasing the concentration of capping protein, which caps barbed ends of actin filaments and prevents elongation, increases the rate of actin-based motility in vivo and in vitro. We studied the synergy between CP and Arp 2 / 3 using an in vitro actin-based motility system reconstituted from purified proteins. We find that capping protein increases the rate of motility by promoting more frequent filament nucleation by the Arp 2 / 3 complex and not by increasing the rate of filament elongation as previously suggested. One consequence of this coupling between capping and nucleation is that, while the rate of motility depends strongly on the concentration of CP and Arp 2 / 3, the net rate of actin assembly is insensitive to changes in either factor. By reorganizing their architecture, dendritic actin networks <b>harness</b> the same <b>assembly</b> kinetics to drive different rates of motility...|$|R
40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonances}} {{generated in}} metallic nanostructures can be utilized to tailor electromagnetic fields. The precise spatial arrangement of such structures {{can result in}} surprising optical properties that are not found in any naturally occurring material. Here, the designed activity emerges from collective effects of singular components equipped with limited individual functionality. Top-down fabrication of plasmonic materials with a predesigned optical response in the visible range by conventional lithographic methods has remained challenging due to their limited resolution, the complexity of scaling, and the difficulty to extend these techniques to three-dimensional architectures. Molecular self-assembly provides an alternative route to create such materials which is not bound by the above limitations. We demonstrate how the DNA origami method {{can be used to}} produce plasmonic materials with a tailored optical response at visible wavelengths. <b>Harnessing</b> the <b>assembly</b> power of 3 D DNA origami, we arranged metal nanoparticles with a spatial accuracy of 2 nm into nanoscale helices. The helical structures assemble in solution in a massively parallel fashion and with near quantitative yields. As a designed optical response, we generated giant circular dichroism and optical rotary dispersion in the visible range that originates from the collective plasmon-plasmon interactions within the nanohelices. We also show that the optical response can be tuned through the visible spectrum by changing the composition of the metal nanoparticles. The observed effects are independent of the direction of the incident light and can be switched by design between left- and right-handed orientation. Our work demonstrates the production of complex bulk materials from precisely designed nanoscopic assemblies and highlights the potential of DNA self-assembly for the fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures.
