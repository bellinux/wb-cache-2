5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear. It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it {{moved closer to the}} coastline, the center of the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> predicted to attain tropical storm status. Early on June4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed. Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore. Late on June4, the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco. Early on June5, the circulation dissipated, and later that night the remnants moved inland.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression {{moved through the}} Yucatán Channel, the convective cloud system became better organized.

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec became better organized on June 29 and became a tropical depression. Strengthening was very limited as the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> approaching to land. It made landfall later that day very near of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. As it continued its west-northwest track, it dissipated inland after bringing torrential rains.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|On May24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} disturbed weather {{resulting from}} the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper-level trough. A surface {{area of low pressure}} formed late the next day, and the low eventually gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 18:00UTC on May27. At the time, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> located about 435miles (695km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and moving west-northwestwards in response to a low over the northwestern Bahamas and a ridge near the coast of North Carolina. Strong vertical wind shear and dry air in the region hindered strengthening, however, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. In the afternoon of May28, a burst of deep convection developed near the northwestern part of the exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC), and the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> forecast to dissipate because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> already exhibiting {{persistent}} deep convection in {{the western}} portion of its circulation. It moved quickly westward, south of a deep layered ridge, escaping the easterly wind shear that had been slowing its development and moving over warmer waters. At 1500UTC on August14, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while still 1450mi (2300km) east of Barbados. Even as its convection waned slightly that afternoon, its intensity grew, and convection flared in the center that night. Dry air and cooler air inflow from the north slowed structural development; nevertheless, ragged bands began to form on August15. By mid-morning, a rough banding eye had formed, and {{by the next morning}} a full eye developed. The storm was upgraded to Hurricane Dean at 0900UTC August16, 550mi (890km) east of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks.

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression had a broad circulation and organized deep convection. It was located over very warm water temperatures, although the upper-level environment was not conducive for significant intensification. Easterly wind shear was forecast, but the NHC anticipated the depression strengthening to 45mph (75km/h) before making landfall in Louisiana. Under {{the influence of a}} mid-level ridge to its north, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> forecast to track generally northwestward. Early on August11, the convection diminished significantly due to the entrainment of dry air and vertical wind shear from a nearby upper-level low. The circulation became difficult to locate; however, conditions favored the redevelopment of the thunderstorm activity. One tropical cyclone prediction model forecast significant intensification to a minimum pressure of 968mbar, and other models forecast the depression would reach hurricane status upon making landfall. As it continued to the northwest, the circulation remained broad and disorganized, and convection remained minimal. Late on August11, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> no longer a tropical cyclone, and in post-analysis, the NHC determined that the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> only a tropical cyclone for 12hours. Redevelopment was not anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> located within {{an area of}} weak steering currents. Initially it was forecast to remain offshore; with warm waters and light wind shear, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> forecast to intensify into a strong tropical storm, and possibly attain hurricane status. However, the circulation was difficult to locate, and as such its exact motion was uncertain. Ships in the region confirmed {{the center of the}} storm as further northeast than previously thought, but also confirmed tropical storm force winds; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), shortly prior to making landfall west of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, late on September20.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{designation}} the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> {{still relatively}} weak and disorganized and, {{due to a}} number of factors, further strengthening was expected to be gradual. Outflow over the cyclone improved throughout the day on September19, however, as it drifted northward. At 0000UTC on September20 the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to the eighth named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Harvey, based on surface observations and reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Shortly thereafter the storm became nearly stationary while slowly beginning to turn eastward. Harvey remained disorganized due to persistent wind shear. Despite the strong wind shear, the cyclone managed to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar (hPa; 29.35 inHg) late on September20.|$|E

40|$|The Sanzhao {{depression}} and Qijia-gulong <b>depression</b> <b>are</b> {{two of the}} most important hydrocarbon-bearing sub-depressions in the Songliao basin, dominated by Cretaceous fluvial and lacustrine strata with volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. In this paper, the pressure distributions and hydrochemistry variations in those two <b>depressions</b> <b>are</b> investigated. It is found that the Qijia-gulong <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> dominated by overpressure, but the Sanzhao <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> dominated by underpressure, especially in the Quantou formation. The salinity of formation water ranges from 1. 0 g/ L to 20 g/L, with a mean of 4 g/L in most formations. Water composition is dominated by NaHCO 3 water type but varies greatly in salinity and ionic ratios in the different depressions. The results of mass balance calculation reveal that, fluid chemistry in the Qijia-gulong <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> dominated by dissolution of silicate minerals and halite, whereas in the Sanzhao <b>depression</b> it <b>is</b> dominated by silicate mineral dissolution, evaporite dissolution (halite and gypsum), carbonate mineral dissolution/precipitation, and cation exchange. © 2005 Elsevier B.

5|$|A {{few hours}} after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the {{depression}} made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00UTC on August3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August5.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted that the previous tropical <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> first observed 300mi (485km) {{southeast of}} Socorro Island on September29. The depression rapidly intensified, {{and was a}} Category1 hurricane only twelve hours after being first observed. Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and the storm had dissipated on September 30.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before attaining tropical depression status. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased {{in the vicinity of}} the storm. Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north along an adjacent upper-level low.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westward, the <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
