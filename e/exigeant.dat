60|$|And {{now that}} she was told that George Bertram was to come to her house, she did not show much more {{excitement}} at the tidings than at the promised advent of Mr. Baron Brawl. She took the matter with such indifference that Sir Henry, at least, had no cause for jealousy. But then she was indifferent about everything. Nothing seemed to wake her either to joy or sorrow. Sir Henry, perhaps, was contented; but lovely, ladylike, attractive as she was, he sometimes did feel almost curious to know whether it were possible to rouse this doll of his to any sense of life or animation. He had thought, nay, almost wished, that the name of her old lover would have moved her, that the idea of seeing him would have disturbed her. But, no; one name was the same to her as another. She had been told to go and call on Mrs. Stistick, and she had gone. She was told to receive Mr. Bertram, and she was quite ready to do so. Angels from heaven, or spirits from below, could Sir Henry have summoned such to his table, would have been received by her with equal equanimity. This was dutiful on her part, and naturally satisfactory to a husband inclined to be somewhat <b>exigeant.</b> But even duty may pall on an <b>exigeant</b> husband, and a man may be brought to wish that his wife would cross him.|$|E

He was, moreover, suspicious of neglect, and vindictive when neglected; querulous of others, and intolerant of reproof himself; <b>exigeant</b> among men, and more than politely flattering among women.

60|$|I {{scarcely}} {{consider myself}} {{to have seen}} any thing of art in England.

A day or two before I left, I visited the National Gallery, and made a rapid survey of its contents. There were two of Turner's masterpieces there, which he presented on the significant condition that they should hang side by side with their two finest Claudes. I thought them all four fine pictures, but I liked the Turners best. Yet I did not think any of them fine enough to form an absolute limit to human improvement. But, till I had been in Paris a day or two, perfectly secluded, at full liberty to think and rest, I did not feel that my time for examining art had really come.|$|E

[...] "Something to tell me!" [...] Any grave words like these always presaged some money difficulty to the squire's ears. He loved Frank with the tenderest love. He would have done so under almost any circumstances; but, doubtless, that love had been made more palpable to himself {{by the fact that}} Frank had been a good son as regards money--not <b>exigeant</b> as was Lady Arabella, or selfishly reckless as was his nephew Lord Porlock. But now Frank must be in difficulty about money. This was his first idea. [...] "What is it, Frank; you have seldom had anything to say that has not been pleasant for me to hear?"

6000|$|Ayala {{was foolish}} rather than ungrateful, not {{understanding}} {{the nature of}} the family to which she was relegated. Before she had been taken away she had promised Lucy that she would be [...] "obedient" [...] to her aunt. There had hardly been such a word as obedience known at the bijou. If any were obedient, it was the mother and the father to the daughters. Lucy, and Ayala as well, had understood something of this; and therefore Ayala had promised to be obedient to her aunt. [...] "And to Uncle Thomas," [...] Lucy had demanded, with an imploring embrace. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] said Ayala, dreading her uncle at that time. She soon learned that no obedience whatsoever was exacted from Sir Thomas. She had to kiss him morning and evening, and then to take whatever presents he made her. An easy uncle he was to deal with, and she almost learned to love him. Nor was Aunt Emmeline very <b>exigeant,</b> though she was fantastic and sometimes disagreeable. But Augusta was the great difficulty. Lucy had not told her to obey Augusta, and Augusta she would not obey. Now Augusta demanded obedience.|$|E
60|$|Our Colonel, {{in writing}} to Lady Albury, had {{declared}} Aldershot to be a most <b>exigeant</b> place,--by {{which he had}} intended to imply that his professional cares were too heavy to allow his frequent absence; but nevertheless he would contrive occasionally to fly up to London for a little relief. Once when doing so he had found himself sitting in the sculptor's studio, and there listening to Hamel's account of Lucy's troubles at Merle Park. Hamel said nothing as to his own difficulties, but was very eager in explaining the necessity of removing Lucy from the tyranny to which she was subjected. It will perhaps be remembered that Hamel down in Scotland had declared to his friend his purpose of asking Lucy Dormer to be his wife, and also {{the success of his}} enterprise after he had gone across the lake to Glenbogie. It will be borne in mind also that should the Colonel succeed in winning Ayala to his way of thinking the two men would become the husbands of the two sisters. Each fully sympathised with the other, and in this way they had become sincere and intimate friends.|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} his {{philosophy}} and his prayers, Bertram went to bed not in a very happy state of mind. He was a man essentially of a warm and loving heart. He was <b>exigeant,</b> and perhaps even selfish in his love. Most men are so. But he did love, had loved; and having {{made up his mind}} to part from that which he had loved, he could not be happy. He had often lain awake, thinking of her faults to him; but now he lay thinking of his faults to her. It was a pity, he said to himself, that their marriage should have been so delayed; she had acted foolishly in that, certainly, had not known him, had not understood his character, or appreciated his affection; but, nevertheless, he might have borne it better. He felt that he had been stern, almost savage to her; that he had resented her refusal to marry him at once too violently: he threw heavy blame on himself. But through all this, he still felt that they could not now marry. Was it not clear to him that Caroline would be delighted to escape from her engagement if the way to do so were opened to her? ...|$|E
60|$|Portray Castle {{was really}} a castle,--not simply a country mansion so called, but a stone edifice with battlements and a round tower at one corner, and a gate which {{looked as if it}} might have had a portcullis, and narrow windows in a portion of it, and a cannon mounted upon a low roof, and an {{excavation}} called the moat,--but which was now a fantastic and somewhat picturesque garden,--running round two sides of it. In very truth, though a portion of the castle was undoubtedly old, and had been built when strength was needed for defence and probably for the custody of booty,--the battlements, and the round tower, and the awe-inspiring gateway had all been added by one of the late Sir Florians. But the castle looked like a castle, and was interesting. As a house it was not particularly eligible, the castle form of domestic architecture being <b>exigeant</b> in its nature, and demanding that space, which in less ambitious houses can be applied to comfort, shall be surrendered to magnificence. There was a great hall, and a fine dining-room with plate-glass windows looking out upon the sea; but the other sitting-rooms were insignificant, and the bedrooms were here and there, and were for the most part small and dark. That, however, which Lizzie had appropriated to her own use was a grand chamber, looking also out upon the open sea.|$|E
6000|$|Five miles {{further on}} {{we arrived at}} the tents of the Phipun, whose wife was {{prepared}} to entertain us with Tartar hospitality: magnificent tawny Tibet mastiffs were baying at the tent-door, and some yaks and ponies were grazing close by. We mustered twelve in number, and squatted cross-legged in a circle inside the tent, the Soubah and myself being placed on a pretty Chinese rug. Salted and buttered tea was immediately prepared in a tea-pot for us on the mat, and in a great caldron {{for the rest of the}} party; parched rice and wheat-flour, curd, and roasted maize* [Called [...] "pop-corn" [...] in America, and prepared by roasting the maize in an iron vessel, when it splits and turns partly inside out, exposing a snow-white spongy mass of farina. It looks very handsome, and would make a beautiful dish for dessert.] were offered us, and we each produced our wooden cup, which was kept constantly full of scalding tea-soup, which, being made with fresh butter, was very good. The flour was the favourite food, of which each person dexterously formed little dough-balls in his cup, an operation I could not well manage, and only succeeded in making a nauseous paste, that stuck to my jaws and in my throat. Our hostess' hospitality was too <b>exigeant</b> for me, but the others seemed as if they could not drink enough of the scalding tea.|$|E
6000|$|And if I {{may seem}} to be asking {{anything}} new or troublesome, I beg you to remember, that it is the primary idea of this College to vindicate women's right to an education in all points equal to that of men; the difference between them being determined not by any fancied inferiority of mind, but simply by the distinct offices and character of the sexes. And surely when you recollect the long drudgery at Greek and Latin verses which is required of every highly-educated man, and the high importance which has attached to them for centuries in the opinion of Englishmen, you cannot think that I am too <b>exigeant</b> in asking you for a few sets of English verses. Believe me, that you ought to find their beneficial effect in producing, as I said before, a measured deliberate style of expression, a habit of calling up clear and distinct images on all subjects, a power of condensing and arranging your thoughts, such as no practice in prose themes can ever give. If you are disappointed of these results it will not be the fault of this long-proved method of teaching, but of my own inability to carry it out. Indeed I cannot too strongly confess my own ignorance or fear my own inability. I stand aghast when I compare my means and my idea, but I believe that [...] "by teaching thou shalt learn," [...] is a rule of which I too shall take the benefit, and having begun these lectures in the name of Him who is The Word, and with the firm intention of asserting throughout His claims as the inspirer of all language and of all art, I may perhaps hope for the fulfilment of His own promise: [...] "Be not anxious what you shall speak, for it shall be given you in that day and in that hour what you shall speak." ...|$|E
60|$|Whatever Mr. Kennedy and Lady Laura {{might think}} about Loughton {{and the general}} {{question}} of small boroughs, it was found by the Government, to their great cost, that Mr. Turnbull's clause was a reality. After two months of hard work, all questions of franchise had been settled, rating and renting, new and newfangled, fancy franchises and those which no one fancied, franchises for boroughs and franchises for counties, franchises single, dual, three-cornered, and four-sided,--by various clauses to which the Committee of the whole House had agreed after some score of divisions,--the matter of the franchise had been settled. No doubt there was the House of Lords, and there might yet be shipwreck. But it was generally believed that the Lords would hardly look at the bill,--that they would not even venture on an amendment. The Lords would only be too happy to let the matter be settled by the Commons themselves. But then, after the franchise, came redistribution. How sick of the subject were {{all members of the}} Government, no one could tell who did not see their weary faces. The whole House was sick, having been whipped into various lobbies, night after night, during the heat of the summer, for weeks past. Redistribution! Why should there be any redistribution? They had got, or would get, a beautiful franchise. Could they not see what that would do for them? Why redistribute anything? But, alas, {{it was too late to}} go back to so blessed an idea as that! Redistribution they must have. But there should be as little redistribution as possible. Men were sick of it all, and would not be <b>exigeant.</b> Something should be done for overgrown counties;--something for new towns which had prospered in brick and mortar. It would be easy to crush up a peccant borough or two,--a borough that had been discovered in its sin. And a few boroughs now blessed with two members might consent to be blessed only with one. Fifteen small clauses might settle the redistribution, in spite of Mr. Turnbull,--if only Mr. Daubeny would be good-natured.|$|E
60|$|With Mr. Moss {{there was}} a double motive, neither of which was very bright, but both of which he {{followed}} with considerable energy. He had at first been attracted by her good looks, which he had desired to make his own--at the cheapest price at which they might be had in the market. If marriage were necessary, so be it, {{but it might be}} that the young lady would not be so <b>exigeant.</b> It was probably the expression of some such feelings {{in the early days of}} their acquaintance which had made him so odious to her. Then Frank Jones had come forward; and like any good honest girl, in a position so public, she had at once let the fact of Mr. Jones be made known, so as to protect her. But it had not protected her, and Mr. Moss had been doubly odious. Then, by degrees, he had become aware of the value of her voice, and he perceived the charms that there were in what he pictured to himself as a professional partnership as well as a marriage. Various ideas floated through his mind, down even to the creation of fresh names, grand married names, for his wife. And if she could be got to see it in the light he saw it, what a stroke of business they might do! He was aware that she expressed personal dislike to him; but he did not think much of that. He did not in the least understand the nature of such dislike as she exhibited. He thought himself to be a very good-looking man. He was one of a profession to which she also belonged. He had no idea that he was not a gentleman but that she was a lady. He did not know that there were such things. Madame Socani told him that this young woman was already married to Mr. Jones, but had left that gentleman because he had no money. He did not believe this; but in any case he would be willing to risk it. The peril would be hers and not his. It was his object to establish the partnership, and he did not even yet see any fatal impediment to it.|$|E

[...] This {{was the first time}} that she had allowed herself the use of the Baronet's name without the prefix. [...] "When it is to be I have not as yet even begun to think.

[...] Mrs. Thorne was aware that her uncle had absolutely quarrelled with his mother and sisters, and had not spoken to them for years.

[...] Mrs. Thorne was aware that the Bishop, who was a strict man, would not touch Sir Francis Geraldine with a pair of tongs. [...] "But all these things will shake themselves down comfortably no doubt. In the meantime I am in a twitter of ecstatic happiness. You, who have gone through it all, will quite understand what I mean. It seems that as a lover he is the most <b>exigeant</b> of gentlemen.

60|$|About {{this time}} Lord Kingsbury found it {{necessary}} {{to say a few words}} to Mr. Greenwood. There had not of late been much expression of kindness from the Marquis to the clergyman. Since their return from Germany his lordship had been either taciturn or cross. Mr. Greenwood took this very much to heart. For though he was most anxious to assure to himself the friendship of the Marchioness he did not at all wish to neglect the Marquis. It was in truth on the Marquis that he depended for everything that he had in the world. The Marquis could send him out of the house to-morrow,--and if this house were closed to him, none other, as far as he knew, would be open to him except the Union. He had lived delicately all his life, and luxuriously,--but fruitlessly as regarded the gathering of any honey for future wants. Whatever small scraps of preferment might have come in his way had been rejected as having been joined with too much of labour and too little of emolument. He had gone on hoping that so great a man as the Marquis would be able to do something for him,--thinking that he might at any rate fasten his patron closely to him by bonds of affection. This had been in days before the coming of the present Marchioness. At first she had not created any special difficulty for him. She did not at once attempt to overthrow the settled politics of the family, and Mr. Greenwood had been allowed to be blandly liberal. But during the last year or two, great management had been necessary. By degrees he had found it essential to fall into the conservative views of her ladyship,--which extended simply to the idea that the cream of the earth should be allowed to be the cream of the earth. It is difficult in the same house to adhere to two political doctrines, because the holders of each will require support at all general meetings. Gradually the Marchioness had become <b>exigeant,</b> and the Marquis was becoming aware that he was being thrown over. A feeling of anger was growing up in his mind which he did not himself analyze. When he heard that the clergyman had taken upon himself to lecture Lady Frances,--for it was thus he read the few words which his son had spoken to him,--he carried his anger with him for a day or two, till at last he found an opportunity of explaining himself to the culprit.|$|E
60|$|But {{the words}} of her comforters had their effect, as no doubt {{was the case with}} Job. She had complained to no one, but {{everybody}} had seen her condition. Her poor dear old mother, who would have put up with a very moderate amount of good usage on the part of such a lover as Sir Francis, had been aware that things were not as they should be. Her three friends, to whom she had not opened her mouth in the way of expressing her grievance, had all seen her trouble. That Maude Hippesley and Miss Altifiorla had noticed it did not strike her with much surprise, but that Mrs. Green should have expressed herself so boldly was startling. She could not but turn the matter over in her own mind and ask herself whether she were ill-treated. And it was not only those differences which the ladies noticed which struck her as ominous, but a certain way which Sir Francis had when talking to herself which troubled her. That light tone of contempt if begun now would certainly not be dropped after their marriage. He had assumed an easy way of almost laughing at her, of quizzing her pursuits, and, worse still, of only half listening to her, which she felt to promise very badly for her future happiness. If he wanted his liberty he should have it,--now and then. She would never be a drag on her husband's happiness. She had resolved from the very first not to be an <b>exigeant</b> wife. She would care for all his cares, but she would never be a troublesome wife. All that had been matter of deep thought to her. And if he were not given to literary tastes in earnest,--for in the first days of their love-making there had been, as was natural, a little pretence,--she would not harass him by her pursuits. And she would sympathise with his racing and his shooting. And she would interest herself, if possible, about Newmarket,--as to which place she found he had a taste. And, joined to all the rest, there came a conviction that his real tastes did take that direction. She had never before heard that he had a passion for the turf; but if it should turn out that he was a gambler! Had any of her friends mentioned such an idea to her a week ago, how she would have rebuked that friend! But now she added this to her other grievances, and began to tell herself that she had become engaged to a man whom she did not know and whom she already doubted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Fanny, you are {{absolutely}} in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you {{for a short time}} into our circle in town, that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret were married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and <b>exigeant,</b> and wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to know how {{to make the best of}} it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there is attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I had my doubts at the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can think of him with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not." ...|$|E

LA REDUCTION DES DELAIS DE DEVELOPPEMENT DE CES SYSTEMES, RECLAMEE PAR LE MARCHE TOUJOURS PLUS <b>EXIGEANT</b> ET CONCURRENTIEL, NE PEUT ETRE ATTEINTE SANS LA CREATION DE NOUVELLES METHODES ET D'OUTILS ADAPTES A CES DERNIERES. DANS CETTE THESE, NOUS PROPOSONS UN ENVIRONNEMENT DE PROGRAMMATION VISANT A L'OBTENTION DE CODES SURS (PAR CONSTRUCTION) QUANT AU RESPECT DES CONTRAINTES TEMPORELLES. CET OUTIL DEVRAIT CONTRIBUER A LIMITER LE RECOURS A DES CAMPAGNES DE TESTS INTENSIVES DONT LA DUREE PESE AUJOURD'HUI FORTEMENT SUR LES TEMPS DE DEVELOPPEMENT. L'ORIGINALITE DE CET ENVIRONNEMENT REPOSE SUR LA COMBINAISON DE TECHNIQUES DE COMPILATION, DE MODELISATION ET D'ANALYSE. IL INTEGRE DEUX APPROCHES : APPROCHE SYNCHRONE (UTILISATION DU LANGAGE SYNCHRONE ESTEREL) POUR LA CONCEPTION ET MODEL-CHECKING POUR LA VALIDATION DES CONTRAINTES TEMPORELLES. UNE NOUVELLE METHODE DE COMPILATION DU LANGAGE SYNCHRONE ESTEREL A ETE ELABOREE DANS LE BUT DE MODELISER DE FACON PRECISE LE COMPORTEMENT TEMPOREL DU SYSTEME EMBARQUE DECRIT EN ESTEREL. CETTE METHODE OFFRE UN COMPROMIS TAILLE DE CODE / VITESSE DE REACTION INTERESSANT POUR LES SYSTEMES TEMPS-REEL EMBARQUES ET SE COMPARE TRES FAVORABLEMENT AUX METHODES DE COMPILATION EXISTANTES. LE COMPILATEUR REALISE A ETE CONNECTE AVEC LE VERIFICATEUR FORMEL KRONOS DE VERIMAG POUR PERMETTRE LA VALIDATION DIRECTE ET AUTOMATIQUE DES CONTRAINTES TEMPORELLES AUXQUELLES LE SYSTEME DOIT SATISFAIRE. CETTE VALIDATION EST REALISEE SUR UN MODELE FORMEL GLOBAL (AUTOMATE TEMPORISE) PRENANT EN COMPTE NON SEULEMENT LE COMPORTEMENT DYNAMIQUE DU SYSTEME ET DE SON IMPLANTATION SUR LA MACHINE CIBLE (OBTENU PAR COMPILATION DU CODE ESTEREL), MAIS AUSSI CELUI DE SON ENVIRONNEMENT EXTERNE.

A PARTIR D'UNE DEMARCHE D'OBSERVATION PARTICIPANTE ETALEE SUR UNE DIZAINE D'ANNEES ET DES ENTRETIENS REALISES AUPRES DES ANIMATEURS, CE TRAVAIL SITUE L'ACTION DE CES DERNIERS DANS LES ESPACES DE PROXIMITE ET PAR RAPPORT AUX POLITIQUESDES INSTITUTIONS LOCALES L'ANIMATEUR INTERVIENT AUPRES DU PUBLIC LE PLUS > AYANT DES NORMES DE SOCIALISATIONS ET DES PRATIQUES QUOTIDIENNES DIFFERENTES. LES JEUNES ISSUS DE L'IMMIGRATION CONSTITUENT L'ESSENTIEL DE CE PUBLIC D'UNE PART, L'ANIMATEUR EST CONTESTE EN TANT QUE REPRESENTANT DE L'INSTITUTION ET D'AUTRE PART IL DOIT METTRE EN PLACE DES ACTIVITES AVEC CE PUBLIC CONTESTATAIRE ETTROUVER DES ESPACES DE NEGOCIATION ET DE COMPROMIS. ON OBSERVE QUE LA STRATEGIE DES COLLECTIVITES TERRITORIALES SE LIMITE DANS LA PLUPART DES CAS A UNE APPROCHE QUI CONSISTE A MAINTENIR LES DIFFICULTES SOCIALES AVEC DES INTERVENTIONS REGULATRICES. ON CONSTATE UNE DISCONTINUITE ET UNE INCOHERENCE PERMANENTE DANS LA STRATEGIE DES POUVOIRS PUBLICS CONCERNANT LES MISSIONS ATTRIBUEES AUX ANIMATEURS CES DERNIERS SE TROUVENT ENTRE UNE POLITIQUE AMBIGUE, NON DEFINIE ET SOUVENT CHANGEANTE ET UN PUBLIC <b>EXIGEANT,</b> CONTESTATAIRE. DANS CETTE SITUATION INCERTAINE, L'ANIMATEUR S'EPUISE RAPIDEMENT, IL CHANGE ALORS DE CADRE DE TRAVAIL OU, DES QU'IL TROUVE UNE OPPORTUNITE, QUITTE LE CHAMP DE L'ANIMATION LA PLUPART DES ANIMATEURS CONSIDERENT LEUR METIER COMME UNE PERIODE TRANSITOIRE DANS CE MEME CONTEXTE, LES ANIMATEURS ISSUS DE L'IMMIGRATION APPARAISSENT COMME UNE REPONSE DE PLUS EN PLUS ADAPTEE POUR REGLER LES CONFLITS PROVOQUES PAR LES JEUNES DU MEME MILIEU BLOQUE ENTRE UN STATUT ET UN AVENIR PROFESSIONNEL INCERTAINS ET LA COMPLEXITE DES TACHES A EFFECTUER, L'ANIMATEUR ATTEND UNE CONSIDERATION AUTRE QUE LE FAIT D'ETRE UN SIMPLE FUSIBLE JETABLE A TOUT MOMENT APRES UTILISATIONEVRY-BU (912282101) / SudocPARIS 5 -Bib.
