5|$|In 2007, the Bijeljina truth {{commission}} was created with a four-year mandate. It <b>held</b> <b>two</b> public hearings in 2008, but by March 2009, {{although it was}} not formally disbanded, the {{commission was}} effectively dissolved when the majority of its members resigned. A number of factors have been cited as contributing to its failure, such as the inclusion of the commander of the Batković concentration camp in its delegation, its limited legal standing, disputes over the commission's scope, and poor funding.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, the Australian {{government}} was sufficiently {{concerned about the}} condition and lack of development of these leases that it <b>held</b> <b>two</b> inquiries between 1932 and 1938.

By the time Pétrus' lease ran out in September 2008, it <b>held</b> <b>two</b> Michelin stars under Wareing. This {{resulted}} in a public feud between Wareing and Ramsay as Wareing took over Pétrus' former location in the hotel, opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley, while Ramsay retained the rights to the Pétrus name.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{beginning}} of Koufax's breakout season. Posting an 18–13 record for the Dodgers in 1961, Koufax led the league with 269 strikeouts, breaking Christy Mathewson's 58-year-old NL mark of 267. Koufax was selected as an All-Star {{for the first time and}} made two All-Star Game appearances; MLB <b>held</b> <b>two</b> All-Star games from 1959 through 1962. He faced only one batter in the 9th inning in the first game, giving up a hit to Al Kaline and he pitched two scoreless innings in the second game.|$|E

In spite of criticism that playing two such games in a season would lessen the spectacle, the Heritage Classic eclipsed all previous NHL outdoor games in sponsorship.

5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he <b>held</b> <b>two</b> significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders <b>held</b> <b>two</b> mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy, {{over the course of}} the conflict, had been {{successively}} driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy close blockade, ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour. In 1809, the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out into open water, only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads. Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders, including privateers and frigate squadrons, often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel. The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy, each of which maintained squadrons. In 1810, Cherbourg's anchorage <b>held</b> <b>two</b> ships of the line and a large, newly built frigate Iphigénie, while the frigates Elisa and Amazone were stationed at Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously <b>held</b> <b>two</b> Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
