The simplified approach requires spectrum analyzer rather than vector network analyzer. A minimum phase retrieval method based on Hilbert transform {{is used to}} retrieve the phase information. The proposed method is shown to be applicable to the <b>insertion</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function.</b> While linear phase component cannot be retrieved, important factors for UWB receiver design such as group delay ripple and dispersion effect can be retrieved. In noisy channels, phase retrieval could be superior to direct phase measurements. Estimation of linear phase component can be achieved through matching the measured phase with the retrieve...|$|E
40|$|A {{widely used}} method for noncontact {{electromagnetic}} {{characterization of materials}} {{is based on the}} measurement of an <b>insertion</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>function.</b> This function, defined as the ratio of two phasor signals measured in the presence and absence of the material under test, is related to the dielectric constant of the material through a complex transcendental equation. Solving this equation requires a numerical two-dimensional root search technique, which is often time consuming due to slow convergence and the existence of spurious solutions. In this paper, a new formulation is presented, which facilitates the evaluation of complex dielectric constant of low-loss materials by means of real equations, thus requiring only one-dimensional root search techniques. Two sample materials are measured, and it is shown that their dielectric constants obtained from the exact complex equation and the new formulation are in excellent agreement. The new formulation reduces the computation time significantly and is highly accurate for the characterization of low-loss materials...|$|E

Nonparametric {{smoothing}} methods are used to model the relationship between variables (the <b>transfer</b> <b>function)</b> and the noise is modeled as an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) process. The <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is estimated jointly with the ARMA parameters. Nonparametric smoothing methods are flexible thus can be used to model highly nonlinear relationships between variables. In this paper polynomial splines are used to model the <b>transfer</b> <b>function.</b> Modeling noise term as an ARMA process removes the serial correlation so the <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> can be estimated efficiently. As a result, the nonparametric <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> model can generate accurate forecasts when the <b>transfer</b> <b>function</b> is highly nonlinear with unknown functional form.
