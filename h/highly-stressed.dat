40|$|In joint {{arthroplasty}} one of {{the main}} issues related to the failure of prosthetic implants is due to the wear of the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) component. Surface treatments and coatings have been recognized as enhancing methods, able to improve the tribological properties of the implants. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to investigate the possibility to fabricate yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings on a metal (AISI 316 -L) substrate by means of Pulsed Electron Deposition, in order to improve the tribological behavior of the polymer-metal coupling, by reducing the initial wear of the UHMWPE component. In order to optimize the coating characteristics, the effects of working gas pressure on both its morphological and tribological properties were analyzed. Morphological characterization of the films was evaluated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Coating wettability was also estimated by contact angle (CA) measurement. Tribological performance (coupling friction and wear of UHMWPE) was evaluated by using a ball-on-disc tribometer during <b>highly-stressing</b> tests in dry and lubricated (i. e. NaCl and serum) conditions; friction and wear were specifically evaluated at the initial sliding distances - to highlight the main effect of coating morphology - and after 100 m - where the influence of the intrinsic materials properties prevails. AFM analysis highlighted that the working pressure heavily affected the morphological characteristics of the realized films. The wettability of the coating at the highest and lowest deposition pressures (CA ~ 60 °, closed to substrate value) decreased for intermediate pressures, reaching a maximum CA of ~ 90 °. Regarding tribological tests, a strong correlation was found in the initial steps between friction coefficient and wettability, which decreased as the distance increased. Concerning UHMWPE wear associated to coated counterpart, at 100 m a reduction rate of about 7 % in dry, 12 % in NaCl and 5 % in presence of serum was obtained compared to the uncoated counterpart. Differently from what highlighted for friction, no correlation was found between wear rate and morphological parameters. These findings, in agreement with literature, underlined the effect of the deposition pressure on the morphological properties, but suggested that physical characteristics are influenced too. Further research on the deposition process will be required in order to improve the tribological performance of the coating at long distances, addressing - above all - orthopedic applications...|$|R

The {{effects of the}} eccentricity of maximum tangential stress and the radial stress gradient are considered in the analysis. The maximum lateral displacement and the maximum moment on the rock slabs are calculated by using vector superposition method. It shows that the slenderness, the eccentricity, the elastic modulus of the slabs and the loading stress play important roles on the buckling failure of rock slabs. The confining pressure provided by filling material can prove adequate to control buckling failure under certain loading conditions. The way to obtain the basic parameters in buckling analysis is also discussed in the paper. According to the buckling theory, a case study was discussed at the Maluping Mine in the Guizhou Kailin Group, China.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{field of}} the Sun is well represented by its lowest energy (or potential) state. Recent observations, by comparison, reveal that many solar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic fields that are highly non-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energy state. This non-potential component of the surface field is neglected by current stellar wind models. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine its effect on the coronal structure and wind. We use Zeeman-Doppler surface magnetograms of two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surface field - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star. We find that the stresses are carried almost exclusively in a band of uni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to mid-latitudes. Using this static solution as an initial state for an MHD wind model, we then find that the final state is determined primarily by the potential component of the surface magnetic field. The band of azimuthal field must be confined close to the stellar surface as it is not compatible with a steady-state wind. By artificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate that the observed azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind but must be due to processes at or below the stellar surface. We conclude that the background winds of solar-like stars are largely unaffected by these <b>highly-stressed</b> surface fields. Nonetheless, the increased flare activity and associated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany such <b>highly-stressed</b> fields may have a significant impact on any surrounding planets.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} {{overburden}} stress on fracture-matrix flow partitioning were numerically analyzed using two different numerical approaches; the analysis was validated using a fractured Clashach core flood laboratory experimental data. In the first numerical approach, the fracture aperture variation under different overburden stresses, measured using a back calculation method based on {{the treatment of the}} fracture as an equivalent porous medium, was adopted in a coupled Darcy law, Brinkman flow and Navier-Stokes fluid flow formulation. In the second numerical approach, poro-elasticity was applied in order to accurately account for fracture aperture change under overburden stress loading. The resulting displacements were coupled to the same fluid flow equations used in the first approach through a moving mesh technique. This was further coupled with stress dependent permeability within the matrix. Flow partitioning from the two numerical approaches were compared to the experimental data. This comparison highlighted the inefficiency of treating fractures as equivalent porous medium. Moreover the cross-flow between the fracture and the matrix was monitored in both modeling approaches and a critical stress beyond which the matrix can no longer feed the fracture was identified.

40|$|Effects of {{fastener}} clearance fit, friction coefficient, and corrosion pillowing on {{the stress}} state in triple-row riveted lap joints were studied numerically using three-dimensional finite element methods. The material elastoplastic constitutive relationship and geometric nonlinear properties, {{as well as}} nonlinear contact boundary conditions, {{were included in the}} numerical simulations. The numerical modeling was validated using experimental measurements of the rivet driven head deformation and in-situ strains. The lap joints were loaded in tension after riveting. Three different clearance fits, three different friction coefficients, and four corrosion pillowing conditions were analyzed. The stress variation along prescribed paths during the tensile loading stage is discussed for each of these conditions. Full-field contours of the friction and maximum principal stresses during the tensile loading stage were investigated. Numerical results showed that a small increase in the clearance fit considerably increased the joint stress magnitude. The clearance fit magnitude also affected the maximum stress location in the vicinity at the top fastener hole. A large friction coefficient increased the contact and friction stresses in the hole vicinity. These results could explain the scatter degree of the fatigue data and could be used to improve the manufacture quality for high fatigue-rated riveted lap joints. Serious corrosion pillowing significantly increased the stress magnitude at both the middle and top hole regions, and led to the co-existence of the two <b>highly-stressed</b> areas in the outer sheet, which greatly decreased the integrity of the aged riveted lap joint due to the occurrence of the multiple-sited damages during cyclic loading.

Acoustic emission and electron-microscopy observations, coupled with an elastic-plastic finite-element stress analysis and grain-boundary-segregation measurements using selected-area Auger-electron spectroscopy {{were used to determine}} the critical local stress for fracture of a grain boundary in notched four-point bend specimens tested in air and hydrogen gas. Tensile tests of unnotched specimens were also utilized. The results indicate that, in both air and hydrogen, brittle fracture in this steel initiates in grain boundaries with the largest inclusions and highest Sb concentrations and that the volume of <b>highly-stressed</b> material plays an important role. Increased grain-boundary concentrations of Sb and hydrogen each had the effect of lowering the stress necessary for nucleation and unstable propagation of the microcracks. The results are interpreted in terms of a probability-based intergranular-fracture criterion which accounts for the effects of grain-boundary impurity concentration distributions, grain-boundary inclusion-size distributions, and the effects of specimen geometry and local stress fields on the measured intergranular-fracture stress. The results of the hydrogen experiments indicate that the principal effect of hydrogen is a reduction of cohesion, rather than enhancement of plasticity. Grain-boundary segregation observations indicate that antimony and nickel cosegregate to the prior-austenite grain boundaries in these steels. Their segregation behavior agrees qualitatively and semiquantitatively with the predictions of Guttmann 2 ̆ 7 s thermodynamic model of segregation in multi-component systems. Also, it was found that grain-boundary microstructural effects, in particular, the martensitic-lath substructures in this steel, are a major source of compositional variability from point-to-point on fracture surfaces. ...|$|E

Ingestion (or ingress) of hot mainstream gases through rim seals {{is a threat to}} the operating life and integrity of <b>highly-stressed</b> components, particularly in the first-stage turbine. Egress of sealing flow from the first-stage can be re-ingested in downstream stages. This paper presents experimental results using a 1. 5 -stage test facility designed to investigate ingress into the wheel-spaces upstream and downstream of a rotor disc. Re-ingestion was quantified using measurements of CO 2 concentration, with seeding injected into the upstream and downstream sealing flows. Here a theoretical mixing model has been developed from first principles and validated by the experimental measurements. For the first time, a method to quantify the mass fraction of the fluid carried over from upstream egress into downstream ingress has been presented and measured; it was shown that this fraction increased as the downstream sealing flow rate increased. The upstream purge was shown to not significantly disturb the fluid dynamics but only partially mixes with the annulus flow near the downstream seal, with the ingested fluid emanating from the boundary layer on the blade platform. From the analogy between heat and mass transfer, the measured mass-concentration flux is equivalent to an enthalpy flux and this re-ingestion could significantly reduce the adverse effect of ingress in the downstream wheel-space.

These seals, also called platform overlap seals, reduce the ingress of hot gases which can limit the life of <b>highly-stressed</b> components in the engine. This paper describes the development of a new, patented rim-seal concept showing improved performance relative to a reference engine design, using URANS computations of a turbine stage at engine conditions. The CFD study was limited to a small number of purge-flow rates due to computational time and cost, and the computations were validated experimentally at a lower rotational Reynolds number and in conditions under incompressible flow. The new rim seal features a stator-side angel wing and two buffer cavities between outer and inner seals: the angel-wing promotes a counter-rotating vortex to reduce the effect of the ingress on the stator; the two buffer cavities are shown to attenuate the circumferential pressure asymmetries of the fluid ingested from the mainstream annulus. Rotor disc pumping is exploited to reduce the sealing flow rate required to prevent ingress, with the rotor boundary layer also providing protective cooling. Measurements of gas concentration and swirl ratio, determined from static and total pressure, were used to assess the performance of the new seal concept relative to a bench-mark generic seal. The radial variation of concentration through the seal was measured in the experiments and these data captured the improvements due to the intermediate buffer cavities predicted by the CFD.

For manufacturers of jet-engine components it is important to assess the quality of these at an early stage in the manufacturing of the product.

Additional challenges occur during the implementation of monitoring systems in production.

40|$|Occupational stress among {{teachers}} is a painful, prevalent and costly phenomenon, one which impacts on individuals, families, schools and wider society. A {{growing body of}} evidence suggests that individuals' susceptibility to occupational stress is not determined exclusively by environmental or personality factors, but by the cognitive and behavioural transactions between the individual and potentially stressful events. Two major factors which contribute to individual stress are a person's appraisal of events as threatening or demanding, and the strategies they use in coping with those events. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the relationship between experience, stress levels and coping patterns in a group of primary school teachers. Two groups of teachers were surveyed, 'Starters' who were in their first year of teaching and 'Stayers' who had at least 10 years of teaching experience. Stayers were divided, on the basis of their responses, into Low-stress, Moderate-stress and High-stress groups. The aspects of coping which were explored are: 1. The range of coping strategies used by teachers in each group, 2. The frequency of use of those coping strategies for each group, and 3. The coping styles preferred by teachers in each group. The results of this study show no direct connexion between stress level and any of the demographic variables (sex, age, religion, piety, teaching experience, full-time teaching, part-time teaching and time away from teaching). Nor are significant differences found between the coping patterns of more or less experienced and more or less stress teachers. A pattern is suggested by correlational analysis, wherein inexperienced teachers (Starters) and <b>highly-stressed</b> experienced teachers (High-stress Stayers) show the same preference for coping styles. It is hypothesized that this similarity of preference relates to role of control in reducing stress, and that these groups are examples of different stages of adaptation to teaching.

A linear-elastic model of the mining system is constructed with finite difference code FLAC 3 D. The effect of destress blasting in the panels is simulated by applying a fragmentation factor (α) to the rock mass stiffness and a stress reduction factor (β) to {{the current state of}} stress in the region occupied by the destress panels. As an extreme case, the destress panel is also modeled as a void to obtain the maximum possible beneficial effects of destressing and stress shadow. Four stopes are mined in the stress shadow of the panels in 6 lifts and then backfilled. The effect of destress blasting on the remnant ore pillar is quantified based on stress change and brittle shear ratio (BSR) in the stress shadow zone compared to the base case without destress blasting. To establish realistic rock fragmentation and stress reduction factors, model results are compared to measured stress changes reported for case studies at Fraser and Brunswick mines. A 1. 5  MPa immediate stress decrease was observed 20  m away from the panel at Fraser Mine, and a 4  MPa immediate stress decrease was observed 25  m away at Brunswick Mine. Comparable results are obtained from the current model with a rock fragmentation factor α of 0. 2 and a stress reduction factor β of 0. 8. It is shown that a destress blasting with these parameters reduces the major principal stress in the nearest stopes by 10 – 25  MPa. This yields an immediate reduction of BSR, which is deemed sufficient to reduce volume of ore at risk in the pillar...|$|E
40|$|In gas turbines, hot {{mainstream}} flow can be ingested {{into the}} wheel-space formed between stator and rotor discs {{as a result}} of the circumferential pressure asymmetry in the annulus; this ingress can significantly affect the operating life, performance and integrity of <b>highly-stressed,</b> vulnerable engine components. Rim seals, fitted at the periphery of the discs, are used to minimise ingress and therefore reduce the amount of purge flow required to seal the wheel-space and cool the discs. This paper presents experimental results from a new 1. 5 -stage test facility designed to investigate ingress into the wheel-spaces upstream and downstream of a rotor disc. The fluid-dynamically-scaled rig operates at incompressible flow conditions, far removed from the harsh environment of the engine which is not conducive to experimental measurements. The test facility features interchangeable rim-seal components, offering significant flexibility and expediency in terms of data collection over a wide range of sealing-flow rates. The rig was specifically designed to enable an efficient method of ranking and quantifying the performance of generic and engine-specific seal geometries. The radial variation of CO 2 gas concentration, pressure and swirl is measured to explore, for the first time, the flow structure in both the upstream and downstream wheel-spaces. The measurements show that the concentration in the core is equal to that on the stator walls and that both distributions are virtually invariant with radius. These measurements confirm that mixing between ingress and egress is essentially complete immediately after the ingested fluid enters the wheel-space and that the fluid from the boundary-layer on the stator is the source of that in the core. The swirl in the core is shown to determine the radial distribution of pressure in the wheel-space. The performance of a double radial-clearance seal is evaluated in terms of the variation of effectiveness with sealing flow rate for both the upstream and the downstream wheel-spaces and is found to be independent of rotational Reynolds number. A simple theoretical orifice model was fitted to the experimental data showing good agreement between theory and experiment for all cases. This observation is of great significance as it demonstrates that the theoretical model can accurately predict ingress even when it is driven by the complex unsteady pressure field in the annulus upstream and downstream of the rotor. The combination of the theoretical model and the new test rig with its flexibility and capability for detailed measurements provides a powerful tool for the engine rim-seal designer...|$|E
40|$|Electrosprays of the pure-ion variety embody {{a unique}} {{collection}} of attributes that have compelled interest in derivative technologies across {{a spectrum of}} applications ranging from Focused Ion Beams (FIB) to microrocketry. Unlike conventional colloid sources (i. e., so-called cone-jets or others sources from which droplets typically emanate), pure ion sprays are commonly characterized by narrow distributions of high specific charge and nominal energy deficits {{as a result of}} their evaporative mechanisms. Among other properties of the spray, these are known to enable well-behaved optics (e. g. for nanometric patterning with FIB) and low power overhead (e. g. for efficient electrical-to-kinetic energy transduction in microrocketry) while also providing for innate simplicity and spatial compactness. In spite of their potential for paradigm-shifting impact, the practicality of contemporary pure-ion sources has been tempered by issues relating to reliability and predictability. In contrast to droplet emission, for example, empirical studies strongly suggest that pure-ion modes are only permissible under special sets of circumstances and that important beam qualities (namely the stability but also the current) are sensitive functions of the meniscus configuration. The difficulty in controlling these modes is somewhat abated through the use of fluids like ionic liquids (IL), particularly in connection with several heuristics that have emerged, but the process remains substantially fickle. This is believed to owe most directly to an undeveloped physical understanding. While the physics that govern conventional colloid sources are at least functionally understood at this point, an analogous grasp of their ion relatives has proven elusive. The purpose of this thesis is to begin addressing this issue by way of rigorous theoretical investigations, with the ultimate aim of offering deeper fundamental insight and additional recourse to future design initiatives beyond the existing set of over-simplified heuristics. In this thesis we first conduct a survey of potential contributors to the very multi-physical phenomenon of charge evaporation and identify key influences through basic order-of-magnitude analyses. These are used to inform the formulation of a detailed mathematical framework that is subsequently leveraged in the exploration of evaporation behaviors for a prototypical ionic liquid meniscus across a range of field, media, and hydraulic conditions. The results uncover a previously uncharted family of <b>highly-stressed</b> but ostensibly stable solutions for the problem of a volumetrically-unconstrained source. These appear to be confined to a particular subregion of the global parameter space that emphasizes thoughtful sizing of the meniscus and architecting of the feeding system. The impedance aspect of the latter, in particular, is believed to play a critical role in steady emission when large scale disparities, which are common in practical settings, exist across the parent meniscus. Additional influences that are often neglected in the literature, such as that of the liquid permittivity, are also elucidated and shown to play meaningful roles in evaporation. We conclude by outlining a reasonably comprehensive set of conditions that should be met for steady emission and substantiate these with tangible evidence from our studies. by Chase Coffman.
