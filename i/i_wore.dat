5|$|Each {{ship had}} {{a crew of}} 854{{officers}} and enlisted men. The enlisted crew spaces were located forward in the upper deck, and were cramped and unhygienic. The cabins for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime I was also repainted dark gray at this time.|$|E

I know, because <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> them myself, and I am a singularly romantic figure, whether in my rimless, my Oxford gold-bordered, or the plain gent's spectacles which <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> {{in the privacy of}} my study.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, she {{was awarded}} the Women in Film Crystal Award. Ephron's 2002 play Imaginary Friends explores the rivalry between writers Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy. She coauthored the play Love, Loss, and What <b>I</b> <b>Wore</b> (based on the book by Ilene Beckerman) with her sister Delia, and it has played to sold out audiences in Canada, New York City and Los Angeles.|$|E

Large {{quantities}} of wool being imported to the Islands from Southampton by special licence, where a major cottage industry turned the product into desirable high value goods. Stocking were in high demand in France, 240,000 pairs a year being exported there in the 1660s.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, London was {{profiled}} by Time Out {{magazine in}} their article/photo series {{about the most}} stylish New Yorkers.

25|$|Leonia {{is home to}} the Players Guild of Leonia, which {{operates}} as the oldest continuing theatre troupe in the state of New Jersey, {{and is one of the}} oldest community theatre groups in the state with continuous performances since 1919. Performances have included comedies, tragedies, classics, and musicals. The Guild's production of One Mad Night in 1940 was the first three-act play performed on television, when it was broadcast on WPTZ, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1963, the Children's Show was instituted and continues each spring. Between 1968 and 1998, the Guild produced Theatre in the Park. Since 2002, the Players' Guild of Leonia has produced a Playwright's Showcase featuring original scripts. The Guild operates out of the historic Civil War Drill Hall Theatre on Grand Avenue which is leased from the borough.

500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What <b>I</b> <b>Wore</b> because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, those moments when we are constantly trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book. [...] Once she decided to adapt Love, Loss, and What <b>I</b> <b>Wore</b> into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{stated the}} name [...] "Mr. Lady" [...] {{came from a}} trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: [...] "I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then {{everyone}} started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label." [...] It also related to Ladyman, Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian [...] "supergroup" [...] Team Dresch.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Saran was {{the subject}} of controversy, when a Hindu {{organisation}} in Chennai lodged a police complaint against Saran, objecting to the outfit worn by her during the 175th day celebration of her film [...] In the complaint, the Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) alleged that Shriya's outfit had [...] "offended Hindu culture". Shriya publicly apologised to Tamilians and Hindus, saying it was a mistake, and that she had [...] "great respect for the tradition and culture of Tamil Nadu... I was shooting for a Hindi film in Thanjavur. I came to the function directly from the shooting... I was unaware of the repercussions because of the attire <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> during the function." ...|$|E
500|$|The primary filming {{location}} {{was an early}} 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid and {{the cast and crew}} found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110°F (43°C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, [...] "It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> that [...] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1939, {{at the age}} of 45 {{and with}} {{eyesight}} that continued to deteriorate, he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who gave him regular lessons. Three years later he wrote The Art of Seeing, in which he related: [...] "Within a couple of months I was reading without spectacles and, what was better still, without strain and fatigue.... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good {{as it used to be}} when <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> spectacles." [...] Describing the process, Huxley wrote that [...] "Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation." [...] He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses, stating that [...] "my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing." ...|$|E

500|$|Isherwood {{also notes}} that this serves a female audience. [...] "If there are chick flicks and chick lit – {{derogatory}} though some might find those terms to be – Love, Loss, and What <b>I</b> <b>Wore</b> should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes the light nature of the subject matter: [...] "...isn't out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..." [...] According to Reiner, the show points out that [...] "...if {{there is one thing}} the females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself." [...] He {{also notes that}} the entire performance has meaning as it is [...] "jam-packed and resonant" [...] throughout. Shaw notes that [...] "The cozy humor strikes many women's funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Love, Loss, and What <b>I</b> <b>Wore</b> was {{presented}} on August 2, 2008 at the Bridgehampton Community House as {{a benefit for}} the renovation of the John Drew Theatre/Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York. [...] The production, directed by Karen Lynn Carpenter, starred Linda Lavin, Karyn Quackenbush, Leslie Kritzer, Kathy Najimy, and Sara Chase. [...] Then Daryl Roth produced the play in a Monday night series of benefit performances for Dress for Success, which is a charity organization that serves low-income women by enabling them to afford work clothing and providing job support, again under the direction of Karen Lynn Carpenter. The set of seven Monday night readings were held from February 2 – March 9, 2009 at the Off-off-Broadway DR2 Theatre. The first seven performances had seven different casts. The first cast at DR2 Theatre was Marian Seldes, Joy Behar, Katie Finneran, Heather Burns and Lucy DeVito. [...] Other participants in the original readings included Tyne Daly (who created the narrator character, Gingy, for the New York Production), Rosie O'Donnell, Samantha Bee, Rondi Reed, America Ferrera, Debi Mazar, Marlo Thomas, Blythe Danner, Christine Lahti, Parker Posey, Julie White, Kelly Bishop, Sarah Jones, Veanne Cox and Kristen Wiig.|$|E
500|$|When Tankersley was four, {{her father}} died by suicide, {{believed}} to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. [...] Her mother remarried in 1932 to Albert Gallatin Simms, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in Byron, Illinois, and later moved to the Southwest {{with her mother and}} stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at first, and then moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a [...] property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: [...] "Right away, my stepfather bought me a cow pony, and <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> it out... So my mother got me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, W.R. Brown and Carl Raswan.|$|E

500|$|Lancashire {{states that}} she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status. Her {{background}} had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television. She did not give serious thought to the performing arts {{until the age of}} 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama— where her contemporaries included Shirley Henderson, Maggie O'Neill and Niamh Cusack— Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as [...] "tremendous" [...] but [...] "seriously hard work and quite intimidating". After rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, Pacific Overtures and The Beauty Game, which she states formed [...] "the start of my career as an actor". She found her first professional acting experience [...] "terrifying" [...] {{as a result of the}} live audiences, recalling that, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> a bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!" [...] She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise in The Beauty Game earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards.|$|E

According to her, she was chosen at the {{audition}} because [...] "Steve Barron wanted someone with really long legs, and <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> a black bathing suit that he liked. <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> the same suit in the video. That's how low budget it was!" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> my own shoes and trousers if <b>I</b> <b>wore</b> a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
