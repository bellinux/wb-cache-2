25|$|It {{is thought}} that cricket was {{introduced}} to Slovenia in 1974, after Borut Čegovnik, then a 13-year-old boy from the mountain town of Mežica, {{was introduced to the}} sport on an extended visit to his penpal in Birchington-on-Sea, Kent. He received extensive coaching from his host's father, and went back to his home with a selection of cricket equipment having decided that cricket was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> for his town. Seventeen, mainly single-wicket, tournaments were held between 1974 and 1982, with 24 local boys playing. The game was played in the village until 1982, when several of the ringleaders moved to the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what to do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|Then Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey {{to end the}} over, {{meaning that}} England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were {{delivered}} before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length {{turned out to be}} <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then came back on, and with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.|$|E

[...] Drake's closing rap {{has been described as}} [...] "Best I Ever Had"-esque. David Jeffries of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from Ready. Complimenting the wide appeal of song's title, DJBooth said that, [...] "With a high-caliber guest feature and a radio-ready sound, this single should be <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> to boost the already-substantial sales of Songz' third album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite its success, Robert Christgau wrote that, [...] "Angus Young {{does come}} up with killer riffs, though not as {{consistently}} as a refined person like myself might hope, and lead singer Brian Johnson sings like there's a cattle prod at his scrotum, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> for fans who can't decide whether their newfound testosterone is agony or ecstasy." [...] Christgau gave the album a B–.|$|E

2500|$|Patrick Gomez for People {{gave the}} premiere a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "if the Season 4 premiere is any indication, Once {{has made it}} through its awkward teenage years and emerged a more nuanced and self-aware drama that {{just happens to be}} about witches and dwarfs – and, now, an ice princess from Arendelle." [...] He then called the highlight of the episode [...] "Lana Parrilla, who continues to pepper her Evil Queen with {{just the right amount of}} realism to make her deliciously wicked deeds seem justified, but Frozen is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that has gotten Once really moving." ...|$|E
