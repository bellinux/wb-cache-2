5|$|The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were {{designed}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank, then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became operational in 1946. Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could {{play an important role}} in international development. In 1950, Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank. The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments, without managing those enterprises, and by collaborating with third party investors. When describing the IFC in 1955, World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms, rather than make loans to governments, and it would not manage the projects in which it invests. In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner. It initially had 12 staff members and $100 million ($844.9 million in 2012 dollars) in capital. The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $2 million ($16.4 million in 2012 dollars) loan to a Brazil-based affiliate of Siemens & Halske (now Siemens AG). In 2007, IFC bought 18% stake in the Indian Financial firm, Angel Broking. In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them: Alpha Bank (60 million), <b>Eurobank</b> (50 million), Piraeus Bank (20 million) and National Bank of Greece (20 million).|$|E
25|$|Negrín signed 19 {{consecutive}} sell orders between February 19, 1937 and April 28, 1938, {{directed to}} the successive People's Commissioner of Finance: G. F. Grinko (until May 1937), V. Tchoula (until September 1937) and A. Zverev (until {{the end of the}} war). In them, the value of an ounce of gold troy was converted into pounds sterling, U.S dollars or French francs according to the exchange rate at the London Stock Exchange. According to Martín Aceña, 415tonnes of crude gold (374tonnes of fine gold) were sold in 1937, then between January and April 1938 another 58 (52) were sold, and out of the remaining gold, 35 (31) tonnes were separated from the original deposit to constitute a second deposit that guaranteed a credit of 70 million U.S. dollars. Thus, by August 1938 a remaining 2tonnes were still available. The Republic obtained from the selling of the gold a total of 469.8 million U.S. dollars, 131.6 of which remained within the USSR to pay for various purchases and expenses. The Soviets kept 2.1% of the funds in the form of commissions and brokerage, and kept an additional 1.2% in the form of transport, deposit, melting, and refining expenses: in total, slightly less than 3.3%, approximately 14.5 million U.S. dollars. The remaining 72%, 338.5 million U.S. dollars' worth, was transferred to the Banque Commerciale pour L'Europe du Nord, or <b>Eurobank,</b> in Paris, the Soviet financial organization in France, property of the Gosbank, the national bank of the Soviet Union. From Paris, agents of the Treasury and diplomatic representatives paid for the purchase of matériel acquired in Brussels, Prague, Warsaw, New York and Mexico, among others.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} financial integration, interdependence and exogeneity {{within and}} between Latin American banking and <b>Eurobanking</b> systems {{during a period of}} relative stability after the oil and debt crises of the 1980 s. Significant evidence of cointegration in both long- and short-term relationships is reported. Within Latin America, exogeneity lies mainly with the Brazilian system. Within <b>Eurobanking,</b> the U. S. system is the dominant influence. Between <b>Eurobanking</b> and Latin American banking systems, the U. S. system is the major driving force. With continued interdependence of these banking systems, systemic risk lingers, and vigilance is required in banking supervision. Copyright (c) 2008, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Stefano Battilossi, Financial {{innovation}} {{and the golden}} ages of international banking: 1890 1931 and 1958 81 Throughout the twentieth century, the internationalisation of banking was both a factor for, and an ensuing aspect of, rising globalisation. During the period 1890 1931, commercial banks of industrialised countries promoted organisational and process innovations that successfully challenged the dominance of merchant banks in international financial intermediation. International banking re-emerged from interwar nationalistic retrenchment during the late 1950 s, when banks exploited regulatory asymmetries to foster the emergence of Eurocurrency markets. <b>Eurobanks</b> provided not only global liquidity redistribution but also portfolio transformation services to corporate and sovereign customers. Financial innovations related to <b>Eurobanking</b> mark a secular discontinuity as they proved to be vehicles of a banking revolution, based on competition, deregulation and wholesale-market funding. ...|$|R

40|$|In <b>Eurobanking,</b> the London Interbank Offered Rate {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} the {{reference}} rate for Eurocurrency loan transactions. A debate continues {{as to whether or}} not dominance by London is evident through the movements in interbank offered rates and whether any adverse shocks experienced there are felt through the other major <b>Eurobanking</b> centres of New York and Tokyo. This study finds that in the longer-term New York is the driver of both the London and the Tokyo interbank lending rates. The more important issue is that the interbank offered rates in London, New York and Tokyo show a long-term cointegrating relationship. Whilst Western banking is incestuous in terms of interbank lines of credit, support is nevertheless provided for rational expectations and market efficiency. However, cointegration also constitutes interdependence and in turn shows evidence of systemic risk (the threat of contagion) in these centres is provided. The implications for future research into global financial stability are alluded to in the conclusion. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Fritz Machlup {{recently}} reproposed {{the issue}} of the logical foundation underlying the flows of funds denominated in dollars and other “strong” currencies which are traded in the so-called Euro-dollar market. The present paper shows that Machlup’s study picks out only some of the aspects of a more general theory presented elsewhere and underestimates the possibilities to empirical research opened up by the present statistical endowment. The central thrust of the analysis is the incorporation of the demand for and the supply of international liquidity within a unified framework. The authors first discuss the relationship between the U. S. balance of payments and the Eurodollar market. An interpretation of the empirical content to assign to the reserve position of <b>Eurobanks</b> is then suggested. Finally, the authors postpone to an appendix the discussion of Machlup’s six propositions in terms of a more general framework of international financial flows.   JEL: E 44, F 32 </p...|$|R
