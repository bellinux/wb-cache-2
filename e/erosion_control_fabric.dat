Species which demonstrated potential for growth on fly ash or ameliorated fly ash m glasshouse trials were subsequently tested by direct seeding in situ at the Port Augusta power station in South Australia. Xero-and halophytes from the families Aizoaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Zygophyllaceae performed optimally in both sets of trials, and species most suited for revegetation and regeneration included Mesembryanthemum aitonis, M. nodiflorum, Atriplex holocarpa, A. lindleyi, A. vesicaria, Enchylaena tomentosa, Halosarcia halocnemoides, H. pergranulata, Scaevola collaris and Nitraria billardierei. A range of surface amelioration treatments for fly ash lagoons designed to overcome the chemical and physical limitations of fly ash to plant growth, and to reduce the effects of high temperatures, strong winds and low rainfall in the region were also tested. A 50 - 100 -mm surface cover (overlay) of either local sandy topsoil or compost, stabilized with coarse organic mulch, hydromulch or <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> <b>fabric</b> supported good germination and plant growth. The soil or compost overlay provided a seed bed for initial germination away from the toxic elements of the ash, while the stabilization treatment prevented wind-blown removal of both seed and seed bed, while also conferring some protection to germinating seedlings...|$|E

Two different non-traditional textile fibers, turkey feather fibers and peanut hull fibers, have been explored to determine their suitability in textile products.

50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> <b>fabrics</b> and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|R

After 3 years these used materials were cut from the field for conducting the tests. Unused blankets of the same brands were obtained.

All materials experienced a significant amount of strength loss after use. The natural materials show 80 % strength loss, while the composite and synthetic materials were tested to have around 50 % strength losses after being put to use for 3 years. Thus it can be observed that the composite and synthetic materials have a decent amount of life where <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> is concerned. Other tests also proved that composite materials can be relied upon for <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> to a reasonable extent, and the research goal was achieved...|$|R

40|$|Soil erosion {{is a key}} {{threat to}} {{ecosystem}} services. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures based on an ecosystem services approach. The economic appraisal consists of an assessment (i. e. quantification and valuation) of the on-site and off-site impacts of soil erosion, and its mitigation, on ecosystem services. Many <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures result in negative financial and economic returns. This explains why farmers are generally reluctant to implement <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures without compensation. Based on the assessment described in this study, tramline management, mulching, buffer strips, high-density planting and sediment traps are the most cost-effective <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures for agriculture in the UK. Contour ploughing {{also appears to be}} cost-effective, but this measure is not appropriate in all circumstances and therefore cannot be widely promoted. However, actual cost-effectiveness of <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures will differ for local circumstances, and it is therefore advised that individual assessments are made at farm level or field level before recommendations are made to farmers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Fibrex Corporation has {{capability}} for manufacturing various blends of cellulose fibers {{which have been}} used at locations throughout the country for temporarily <b>controlling</b> <b>erosion</b> on denuded land areas, and for serving as growth media for grass and other vegetation. Soil and climatic conditions vary greatly where these products are used, {{and it is not}} possible to determine by observation whether one is more effective than another in <b>controlling</b> <b>erosion</b> or promoting vegetative growth.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the optimum use of mulch (biodegradable <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> {{blankets}} and waste ballast) on steep slopes (batters) to aid the establishment of grasses for <b>erosion</b> <b>control.</b> Biodegradable blankets are commonly used on steep slopes as mulch to minimize the risk of washout of soil, seeds, and ameliorants during grass establishment to <b>control</b> <b>erosion.</b> However, the blankets can be costly when laid on all sections of the batters. In order to reduce costs, it is suggested to lay the blankets on critical sections such as the outer verge (top) and the bottom. Waste ballast spread on a railway batter provides a degree of permanent protection against erosion, and is useful where fire is a potential hazard. Runoff and soil loss were monitored on experimental plots of a railway embankment batter between December 2000 and May 2001. The cost-effective <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> strategies on the plots were centerd on control (doing nothing after surface preparation), limited use of <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> blankets, and variation of waste ballast density on some seeded plots. It was observed that waste ballast and <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> blankets laid on the outer verge have the potential to control incipient rills by spreading runoff. <b>Erosion</b> <b>control</b> blankets placed at the bottom section of the embankment have the potential to induce deposition of eroded material. Runoff production and soil loss decreases with an increase in the application density of waste ballast, up to a certain level. Waste ballast spread on railway batters enhances grass germination and sustains grass growth...|$|R
