25|$|In a {{storm of}} critics and letters at the government’s {{insufficient}} icebreaker fleet and lenient attitude together with the increasing concern that the voyage would undermine Canada’s sovereignty and set a precedent, the Mulroney government decided to take action. On 10 September 1985, invoking <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> {{as the basis for}} its claims, an order in council was passed that established straight baselines around the outer perimeter of the country, thereby affirming the Northwest Passage to be Canadian waters while vowing to enforce the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act. Promises of increased naval and air patrolling were made; notably a program termed the Polar 8 Project was also announced which proposed the construction of new class of high endurance icebreakers. That program was eventually canceled in 1990 due to budget cuts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Historic</b> <b>titles</b> and <b>historic</b> {{rights have}} been a {{complicated}} issue in {{the law of the}} sea both conceptually and practically.

500|$|The {{small town}} of Sheen on the Surrey bank of the Thames, [...] west of the City of London or [...] by river, had been {{the site of a}} royal palace since 1299. After it was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1497, Henry VII built a new palace on the site, naming it Richmond Palace after his <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> of Earl of Richmond, and the central part of Sheen became known as Richmond.|$|E
2500|$|Before Edward's {{marriage}} in 1999, royal commentators conjectured that former royal dukedoms such as Cambridge or [...] Sussex might be granted to him. [...] Instead, the Palace announced its intention that Prince Edward would eventually succeed {{to the title}} Duke of Edinburgh, currently held by his father. In the meantime, {{in keeping with the}} tradition of sons of monarchs being ennobled upon marriage (while reserving the rank of duke for the future), Prince Edward became the first prince since the Tudors to be specifically created an earl, rather than a duke. The Sunday Telegraph reported that he was drawn to the <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> Earl of Wessex after watching the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love, in which a character with that title is played by Colin Firth.|$|E
2500|$|After the Giants won Super Bowl XLII, Tuck {{achieved}} {{a new level}} of celebrity in his native Alabama. [...] "It was interesting when I went home (to Alabama)," [...] Tuck said. [...] "You couldn't go anywhere without people asking for your autograph or telling you congratulations or how proud they were of you and things like that." [...] The newfound celebrity also extended to New York, where Tuck and Giants wide receiver Amani Toomer were honored by Congressman Charles Rangel at the ball field at Harlem River Park on February 20, 2008. The community celebration was in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory. Three days later, he and several Giants players were honored as [...] "special guests" [...] during a <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> unification bout in Madison Square Garden between heavyweight boxers Wladimir Klitschko and Sultan Ibragimov.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{milestone}} came in 1961-62. First, in {{a symbolic}} gesture Don Javier declared Hugues [...] "duque de San Jaime", a <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> borne by Alfonso Carlos; then, he instructed {{his followers to}} perceive the prince as embodiment of [...] "a king". Hugues, styling himself as Carlos Hugo, settled in Madrid and set up his Secretariat, a personal advisory body. For {{the first time in}} history, a Carlist heir officially lived in the capital and openly pursued his own politics. From this moment onwards, Don Javier was increasingly perceived as ceding daily business to his son and merely providing general supervision from the back seat. Carlos Hugo was gradually taking control of communication channels with his father, replacing him also as a key person representing the house of Bourbon-Parma in Spain. Moreover, three daughters of Don Javier, all in their 20s, with apparent consent of their father engaged themselves in campaigns intended to enhance the standing of their brother in the Spanish public ambience; the younger son of Don Javier, Sixte, soon followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|The oppressive {{rule of the}} Portuguese padroado {{provoked}} a violent reaction {{on the part of}} the indigenous Christian community. [...] The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam (Coonan Cross Oath). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the St. Thomas Christians publicly took an oath in Mattancherry, Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the Jesuit missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the Roman Catholic Pope.Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name Mar Thoma I. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar that the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan was not legitimate as per the traditional apostolic standards. Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syrian Catholics with the <b>historic</b> <b>title</b> 'The Metropolitan and the Gate of all India' which denotes a Quasi Patriarchal status with all India jurisdiction. This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the Pazhayakoottukar, or [...] "Old Party", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the Puthankoottukar, or [...] "New Party". These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.|$|E

This was also reiterated by a decree promulgated on 6 November 1987 concerning titles of members of the royal family.

2500|$|In 1528, {{a charter}} of King Henry VIII gave the town {{the right to}} be known as [...] "The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield" [...] and to be governed by a warden and society. The charter was secured by Bishop John Vesey. This unreformed {{corporation}} survived until 1885, when it was replaced by a municipal borough. Although the title [...] "Royal Town" [...] was still used, the municipality created in 1885 was not itself a Royal borough. However, the townspeople sometimes still use its <b>historic</b> 'Royal' <b>title.</b> This was confirmed to be allowed in 2014 after a two-year campaign by a local newspaper, the Sutton Coldfield Observer, Andrew Mitchell MP, the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society and various local residents. On Thursday, 12 June 2014 government minister Greg Clark confirmed during a special adjournment debate in the House of Commons that [...] "there is no statutory ban to the continuance of <b>historic</b> <b>titles</b> for other [...] purposes" [...] {{in the absence of a}} local governing structure using a historic name, and thus the use of the Royal title is not prohibited (although any such usage has a [...] "lack of technical legal effect").

60|$|But {{the really}} odd thing is this. This false quality in titles does not merely {{apply to the}} new and vulgar titles, but to the old and <b>historic</b> <b>titles</b> also. For {{hundreds}} of years titles in England have been essentially unmeaning; void of that very weak and very human instinct in which titles originated. In essential nonsense of application {{there is nothing to}} choose between Northcliffe and Norfolk. The Duke of Norfolk means (as my exquisite and laborious knowledge of Latin informs me) the Leader of Norfolk. It is idle to talk against representative government or for it. All government is representative government until it begins to decay. Unfortunately (as is also evident) all government begins to decay the instant it begins to govern. All aristocrats were first meant as envoys of democracy; and most envoys of democracy lose no time in becoming aristocrats. By the old essential human notion, the Duke of Norfolk ought simply to be the first or most manifest of Norfolk men.|$|R
