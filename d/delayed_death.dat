40|$|<b>Delayed</b> cell <b>death</b> by mitotic {{catastrophe}} is {{a frequent}} mode of solid tumor cell death after γ-irradiation, a widely used treatment of cancer. Whereas the mechanisms that underlie the early γ-irradiation-induced cell death are well documented, those that drive the <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death</b> are largely unknown. Here we show that the Fas, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α death receptor pathways mediate the <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death</b> observed after γ-irradiation of breast cancer cells. Early after irradiation, we observe the increased expression of Fas, TRAIL-R and TNF-R that first sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Later, the increased expression of FasL, TRAIL and TNF-α permit the apoptosis engagement linked to mitotic catastrophe. Treatments with TNF-α, TRAIL or anti-Fas antibody, early after radiation exposure, induce apoptosis, whereas the neutralization of the three death receptors pathways impairs the <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death.</b> We also show {{for the first time}} that irradiated breast cancer cells excrete soluble forms of the three ligands that can induce the death of sensitive bystander cells. Overall, these results define the molecular basis of the <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death</b> of irradiated cancer cells and identify the death receptors pathways as crucial actors in apoptosis induced by targeted as well as non-targeted effects of ionizing radiation...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{paradigm}} shift that affected neonatal researchers {{in particular was}} the idea that if a baby was resuscitated after cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia there was a period of time before brain cells started to die. Osmund Reynolds at University College London used the newly developed technique of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to show that the infant brain metabolism is normal in the hours after birth asphyxia and deteriorated only after a distinct delay. Robert Vannucci confirmed the effect with painstaking biochemistry, and delayed injury was also reported in neuropathological studies. [...] Delayed brain injury (called ‘secondary energy failure’ by Reynolds) was a critical new idea.

5000|$|On 29 May 2007, in actions not linked {{directly}} to the protein export scandal, Xinhua reported that Zheng Xiaoyu (郑筱萸), {{the former head of}} China's ministry of food and drug safety, had been convicted of personally approving unproven and unsafe medicines after taking bribes from eight pharmaceutical companies totaling more than 6.49 million RMB, (or a rough equivalent of 850,000 US dollars), which resulted in at least hundreds of patient deaths, or perhaps even thousands, and as a result, he was sentenced to death. It was also discovered during his eight-year reign as the head of China's ministry of food and drug safety, Zheng Xiaoyu had personally ordered the approval of more than 150,000 new medicines, an astonishing average of 134 times that of FDA, which only approves 140 or so new medicines annually. Not surprisingly, most of those 150,000 medicines were the products of the eight pharmaceutical companies that bribed Zheng Xiaoyu, and a single unsafe medication of Anhui Hua Yuan (华源) Company (since closed with its CEO committed suicide before his arrest) resulted 14 patient deaths and hundreds being permanently disabled. Zheng Xiaoyu's former deputy was also convicted, for accepting more than two million RMB (or a rough equivalent of a quarter million US dollars) to help Zheng Xiaoyu. The former deputy was sentenced to a two-year <b>delayed</b> <b>death</b> sentence and a new system for unsafe food recall would be implemented {{by the end of the}} year. [...] However, the general public sentiment in China was that this was only the tip of the iceberg, because in the case of Zheng Xiaoyu, the exact amount of the bribe is much higher than what has been revealed so far, and this is confirmed by Zheng Xiaoyu's own confession: in March 2007, Zheng Xiaoyu admitted that the exact amount might never be known for sure because the 6.49 million was only what he accepted, and his wife and son also accepted separate huge bribes which he was not part of, and the investigation on Zheng Xiaoyu's family is still on-going.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the definition of Procedure-related mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as defined by the Committee for Standardized Reporting Practices in Vascular Surgery. METHODS: Data on patients with an AAA were taken from the EUROSTAR database. The patients underwent EVAR between June 1996 and February 2004 and were analyzed retrospectively. Explicit probability of cause of death was recorded. The time interval from operation, hospital discharge or second interventions till death was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 589 out of 5612 patients (10. 5 %) died after EVAR in total follow up and all causes of death were included. 141 (2. 5 %) patients died due to aneurysms reported after the EVAR procedure of which 28 (4. 8 %) were ruptures, 25 (4. 2 %) graft-infections and 88 (14. 9 %) patients who died within 30 days after the initial procedure (present definition, also known as short term clinical outcome). In addition 25 patients died after 30 days, but were then (at moment of death) still in the hospital, or were transferred to a nursing home for further re-evaluation, or needed second interventions. Taking into account the duration of hospitalization and mortality immediately after procedure-related second interventions, 49 <b>delayed</b> <b>deaths</b> might also be regarded as being EVAR procedure-related.

40|$|Apicomplexans are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites causing devastating {{disease in}} both humans and livestock. Nearly all apicomplexans, {{with the exception}} of Cryptosporidium, contain two endosymbiontic organelles carrying their own DNA; the mitochondrion and the plastid-like organelle called the apicoplast. The apicoplast is an attractive drug target as it harbors not only metabolic pathways not found in the host cell, but it is also dependent on its ancient transcriptional and translational machinery. These parasites rely on the plastid, and inhibition of its function or loss of this organelle leads to immediate or <b>delayed</b> <b>death.</b> Replication of plastidic DNA shows differences between the members of this phylum. In Plasmodium parasites, two forms of replication are observed [...] unidirectional single-stranded replication and a rolling circle mechanism [...] whereas in Toxoplasma gondii only the rolling circle is found. Targeting enzymes involved in DNA-replication leads to a <b>delayed</b> <b>death</b> of the parasite. Most of the genes in the apicoplast genome encode elements of their own transcriptional and translational machinery, and they are highly similar to those found in bacteria.

40|$|After mild ischemic insults, many neurons undergo <b>delayed</b> {{neuronal}} <b>death.</b> Aberrant {{activation of}} the cell cycle machinery is thought to contribute to apoptosis in various conditions including ischemia. We demonstrate that loss of endogenous cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p 16 (INK 4 a) is an early and reliable indicator of <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death</b> in striatal neurons after mild cerebral ischemia in vivo. Loss of p 27 (Kip 1), another Cdk inhibitor, precedes cell death in neocortical neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. The loss of Cdk inhibitors is followed by upregulation of cyclin D 1, activation of Cdk 2, and subsequent cytoskeletal disintegration. Most neurons undergo cell death before entering S-phase, albeit a small number (approximately 1 %) do progress to the S-phase before their death. Treatment with Cdk inhibitors significantly reduces cell death in vitro. These results show that alteration of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms is a prelude to <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death</b> in focal cerebral ischemia and that pharmacological interventions aimed at neuroprotection may be usefully directed at cell cycle regulatory mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Status epilepticus (SE), an unremitting seizure, {{is known}} to cause a variety of {{traumatic}} responses including <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death</b> and later cognitive decline. Although excitotoxicity has been implicated in this delayed process, the cellular mechanisms are unclear. Because our previous brain slice {{studies have shown that}} chemically induced epileptiform activity can lead to elevated astrocytic Ca 2 + signaling and because these signals are able to induce the release of the excitotoxic transmitter glutamate from these glia, we asked whether astrocytes are activated during status epilepticus and whether they contribute to <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death</b> in vivo. Using two-photon microscopy in vivo, we show that status epilepticus enhances astrocytic Ca 2 + signals for 3 d and that the period of elevated glial Ca 2 + signaling is correlated with the period of <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death.</b> To ask whether astrocytes contribute to <b>delayed</b> neuronal <b>death,</b> we first administered antagonists which inhibit gliotransmission: MPEP [2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) pyridine], a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist that blocks astrocytic Ca 2 + signals in vivo, and ifenprodil, an NMDA receptor antagonist that reduces the actions of glial-derived glutamate. Administration of these antagonists after SE provided significant neuronal protection raising the potential for a glial contribution to neuronal death. To test this glial hypothesis directly, we loaded Ca 2 + chelators selectively into astrocytes after status epilepticus. We demonstrate that the selective attenuation of glial Ca 2 + signals leads to neuronal protection. These observations support neurotoxic roles for astrocytic gliotransmission in pathological conditions and identify this process as a novel therapeutic target...|$|R

This phenomenon, which is called radiation-induced genomic instability, is manifested by delayed induction of radiation effects, such as cell death, chromosome aberration, and mutation in the progeny of cells surviving radiation exposure. Previously, {{there was a report}} showing that <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death</b> was absent in Ku 80 -deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, however, the mechanism of their defect has not been determined. We found that delayed induction of DNA double strand breaks and chromosomal breaks were intact in Ku 80 -deficient cells surviving X-irradiation, whereas there was no sign for the production of chromosome bridges between divided daughter cells. Moreover, delayed induction of dicentric chromosomes was significantly compromised in those cells compared to the wild-type CHO cells. Reintroduction of the human Ku 86 gene complimented the defective DNA repair and recovered delayed induction of dicentric chromosomes and <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death,</b> indicating that defective Ku 80 -dependent dicentric induction was the cause of the absence of <b>delayed</b> cell <b>death.</b> Since DNA-PKcs-defective cells showed delayed phenotypes, Ku 80 -dependent illegitimate rejoining is involved in delayed impairment of the integrity {{of the genome}} in radiation-survived cells...|$|R
40|$|Neurotoxic {{effects of}} {{excitatory}} amino acids have {{been implicated in}} various neurological disorders, and have been utilized for excitotoxic models of <b>delayed</b> neuronal cell <b>death.</b> The excitotoxic glutamate-induced, <b>delayed</b> neuronal cell <b>death</b> also results in inhibition of calciumlcalmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II). In this report, we characterized the glutamate-induced inhibition of CaM kinase II in relation to loss of intracellular calcium regulation and <b>delayed</b> neuronal cell <b>death.</b> Glutamate (500 PM for 10 min), but not KCI (50 mM), exposure resulted in a significant inhibition of CaM kinase II activity. The inhibition of CaM kinase II activity was observed immediately following excitotoxic glutamate exposure and present at every time point measured. Glutamate-induced inhibition of kinase activity and <b>delayed</b> neuronal cell <b>death</b> was dependent upon both the activation of the NMDA glutamate receptor subtype {{and the presence of}} extracellular calcium. The relationship between inhibition of CaM kinase II activity and loss of intracellular calcium regulation was also examined. Experimental conditions which resulted in significant neuronal cell death and inhibition of CaM kinase II activity also resulted in a long-term loss of intracellular calcium regulation. Thus, inhibition of CaM kinase II activity occurred under experimental conditions which resulted in loss of neuronal viability and loss of neuronal calcium regulation.
