A key question is if new sizing procedures for heat pumps, electric boilers and thermal storages are needed when heat pumps operate in a more dynamic environment, or if sizing is still determined by the thermal demand and thus sizing procedures are already well known. This is answered using structural optimisation based on mixed integer linear programming. The optimal system size of a HP, an electric back-up heater and thermal storage are calculated for 37 scenarios to investigate the impact of on-site PV, variable electricity price, space heat demand and domestic hot water demand.

40|$|The chapter {{discusses}} {{both the}} complementary factors and contradictions of adopting ERP based systems with enterprise 2. 0. ERP is characterized as achieving efficient business performance by enabling a standardized business process design, {{but at a}} cost of <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations.</b> It is claimed that enterprise 2. 0 can support flexible business process management and so incorporate informal and less structured interactions. A traditional view however is that efficiency and flexibility objectives are incompatible as they are different business objectives which are pursued separately in different organizational environments. Thus an ERP system with a primary objective of improving efficiency and an enterprise 2. 0 system with a primary aim of improving flexibility may represent a contradiction and lead to a high risk of failure if adopted simultaneously. This chapter will use case study analysis to investigate the use of a combination of ERP and enterprise 2. 0 in a single enterprise with the aim of improving both efficiency and <b>flexibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations.</b> The chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the combination of ERP with enterprise 2. 0 based on social-technical information systems management theory.
