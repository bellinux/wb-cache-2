5|$|Corrosion, {{due to a}} lack of maintenance, {{affected}} the seals of the hatch covers and the strength of the bulkheads which separate holds. The corrosion <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect due to the immense size of the surfaces involved.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether Luke 22:43-44 Christ's agony at Gethsemane was originally {{in the text}} of Codex C; the leaves that contained the surrounding verses are not extant. Mark 15:28 is not included.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> make {{a precise}} measurement, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in accurately calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.|$|E
50|$|Fisherian runaway has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{demonstrate}} empirically, {{because it}} has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect both an underlying genetic mechanism and a process by which it is initiated.|$|R

5|$|Much of Fauré's piano music <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> play, but {{is rarely}} virtuosic in style. The {{composer}} disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano {{music is a}} classical restraint and understatement.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{diagnose}} clinically as {{the animal}} may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint {{conditions such as}} hip dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} (cancer of the parathyroid gland) is {{the rarest}} cause of OFC, accounting for about 0.5% {{of all cases}} of hyperparathyroidism. OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> diagnose.|$|E

50|$|The Hummers <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre, {{and their}} speed may <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control.

5|$|The {{definition}} of the ampere is undergoing a major overhaul—the current definition, which <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> realise with high precision in practice, is being replaced by a definition that is more intuitive and that is easier to realise.|$|E
5|$|Userkaf's {{mortuary}} temple {{layout and}} architecture <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> establish with certainty. Not {{only was it}} extensively quarried for stone throughout the millennia, but a large Saite period shaft tomb was also dug in its midst, damaging it.|$|E
5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant can}} <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{identify}} {{due in part}} to its similar appearance to other Juncus species. Often Juncus dichotomus is overlooked because it is inconspicuous in the field, and some can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify and some consider Juncus dichotomus a weed.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, some chords <b>are</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{play in a}} regular tuning than in {{standard}} tuning. It can <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> play conventional chords especially in augmented-fourths tuning and all-fifths tuning, in which the large spacings require hand stretching. Some chords, which are conventional in folk music, <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> play even in all-fourths and major-thirds tunings, which do not require more hand-stretching than standard tuning.|$|R

5|$|A {{document}} {{called the}} Tribal Hidage may date from Wulfhere's reign. Drawn up before many smaller groups of peoples were {{absorbed into the}} larger kingdoms, such as Mercia, it records the peoples of Anglo-Saxon England, along with an assessment in hides, a unit of land. The Tribal Hidage <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> date precisely; {{it may have been}} written down in Wulfhere's reign, but other suggested origins include the reign of Offa of Mercia, or Edwin or Oswiu of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2005) {{hypothesis}} is that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy.

5|$|A yoga {{system that}} predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga.

30|$|The use of {{intramedullary}} {{nails in}} comminuted fractures with contained metaphyseal defects is not suitable.

30|$|Their {{influence}} on {{fitness for use}} could be assessed using actual archival documents, however, in such an experiment many variables could <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control: document size, paper texture, writing style, deterioration prior to accession.

5|$|A.viridimontanum <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} {{from its}} parent {{species in the}} field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is {{not known}} whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E
5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority.

50|$|Some {{cognitive}} processes <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> categorize as distinctly automatic or controlled, {{either because they}} contain components of both types of process or because the phenomena <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> define or observe.
