50|$|<b>Jury</b> <b>fees</b> {{refer to}} the daily stipend paid to jurors. The source of these fees varies {{according}} {{to the kind of}} trial. Government pays the fees in criminal trials, while the litigants share the costs in a civil action as part of court costs. Not infrequently, the entire burden of court costs may be shifted to the loser of a civil action. A deposit of one day's fees may be required in advance of the trial by the litigant requesting the presence of a jury.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{adopts a}} new {{perspective}} on the obligation of states to compensate jurors {{on the basis of their}} financial needs. It combs the nation’s history for answers to a variety of significant questions: Why do states compensate jurors? Have there ever been minimal levels of juror compensation among the states of the union? Have any legal challenges resulted in governments raising <b>jury</b> <b>fees?</b> Have states developed uniform standards for juror compensation in light of varied economic conditions? While, at times, the responses to these questions will be brief, answering them is crucial to understanding how <b>jury</b> <b>fees</b> can be set in accordance with both their purpose and their history. In order to set fees fairly, legislatures and courts should use the federal minimum wage as a guideline for determining the minimum compensation owed to jurors. This indexing process would increase the amount of jury compensation as the federal minimum wage increases. The index would remedy the lack of foresight that resulted from the pattern set by the initial jury compensation statutes. Much like legislation enacting pension increases for disabled veterans of the Civil War, jury payment provisions of the same time frame only cited then-current monetary values. This jury Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) immediately would increase the pay of most jurors and remedy the legislative neglect of this issue evident in recent years. It would also serve to keep states abreast of the necessity to increase their juror compensation in the future...|$|R
40|$|What is taxed as court costs? A {{question}} so seemingly simple would rightfully {{lead one}} to believe it held an answer just as basic. Black 2 ̆ 7 s Law Dictionary defines the term as 2 ̆ 2 [tihe charges or fees taxed by the court, such as filing <b>fees,</b> <b>jury</b> <b>fees,</b> courthouse fees, and reporter fees, 2 ̆ 2 a definition which does nothing to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the topic, especially in the State of North Carolina. The statutes involved appear straightforward, {{and the use of}} common principles of statutory interpretation indicate that the 2 ̆ 2 answer 2 ̆ 2 is clear as well-one which would not only clarify the law but also allow for consistent application in the majority of cases that implicate the issue. Unfortunately, case law in North Carolina has only muddled the problem, as the North Carolina Court of Appeals, and various trial courts in the state, have taken two divergent options interpreting various cases dealing with costs, rarely attempting to provide any coherent framework for consistency or clarification. 2 ̆ 2 What constitutes 2 ̆ 7 costs 2 ̆ 7 ? 2 ̆ 2 is a question that is in dire need of conclusive resolution by the supreme court, especially in light of recent case law and legislative amendments to controlling statutes...|$|R

40|$|Many take as a {{given that}} jury-tried cases consume more time than judge-tried cases. Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit, for example, opines: “Court queues are almost always {{greatest}} for parties seeking civil jury trials. This makes economic sense. Such trials are more costly than bench trials both because of <b>jury</b> <b>fees</b> (which … understate the true social costs of the jury) and because a case normally takes longer to try to a jury than to a judge …. Parties are therefore “charged” more for jury trials by being made {{to wait in line}} longer. ” A close reading reveals that he is writing about both aspects of a jury’s speed: how long the actual in-court trial lasts, as well as how long the litigants have to wait before and after trial. The available data generally agree that jury trials take about twice as long as judge trials, although admittedly trials on average are rather short so that the absolute difference is not great. So, it may very well be that commentators are correct in saying that jury trial is slower than judge trial in terms of actual trial time. It thus appears obvious to many that jury-tried cases also last longer on the docket than judge-tried cases. But do jury-tired cases have a longer docket duration than judge-tried cases? In assessing the speed of trial by jury versus trial by judge, one must consider both the length of the actual trial and also the total time from filing to termination of the case. The actual trial may proceed more slowly before a jury than before a judge, because of extra procedural steps. Yet, contrary to intuition, jury-tried cases last less long on the docket than judge-tried cases, probably because the press of other duties leads judges to interrupt the trial and postpone eventual decision. Thus, reformers who seek to speed up civil litigation by eliminating the jury should consider other time-saving measures...|$|R

5000|$|The mail art {{philosophy}} of openness and inclusion is {{exemplified by the}} [...] "rules" [...] included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no <b>jury,</b> no entry <b>fee,</b> there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited. The original contributions {{are not to be}} returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.|$|R
