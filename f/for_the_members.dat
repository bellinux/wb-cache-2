5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, National Unity {{was one of the most}} active groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E

Lawrence goes to the garage {{to search for a}} gift and discovers an old album by Love Händel: he explains to the children that he and Linda shared their first kiss at the band's farewell concert. Lawrence despairs of recapturing the moment, but Candace, Phineas, and Ferb watch a Where Are They Now?-type special about Love Händel, and decide to reform the band.

5|$|St. John's {{served as}} {{the capital city of}} the Colony of Newfoundland and the Dominion of Newfoundland before Newfoundland became Canada's tenth {{province}} in 1949. The city now serves as the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, therefore the provincial legislature is located in the city. The Confederation Building, located on Confederation Hill, is home to the House of Assembly along with the offices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Members</b> of the House of Assembly (MHAs) and Ministers. The city is represented by ten MHAs, four who are members of the governing Progressive Conservative Party, three that belong to the New Democratic Party (NDP), and three that belong to the Liberal Party. Lorraine Michael, leader of the NDP since 2006, represents the district of Signal Hill-Quidi Vidi.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
