Transport joints were used on the fuselage and wings: this allowed sub-contractors to manufacture the Beaufort in easily transportable sections and was to be important when Australian production got under way.

30|$|In {{the single}} region {{emergency}} scenario, {{the results show}} that as the links between rescue point B and transfer point 2 decrease, the emergency scheduling quantity of petroleum in this region decreases. However, the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs both increase. In addition, by setting r_ 2 = 10, the petroleum on that line increases to 5.0, while the minimum relief costs and the general emergency costs are reduced to 595.0 and 37.0, respectively. That finding means that the increase in links tends to result in more allocated petroleum and lower costs. Therefore, with an increase in cross-regional links, there should be more petroleum for an <b>emergency,</b> <b>lower</b> generalized <b>emergency</b> costs, and better emergency effects. Otherwise, the emergency effects will be weakened. There are two ways to reduce the emergency costs. One is increasing the coordination of the cross-regional emergency, and the other is technical innovations in the petroleum emergency.|$|R

40|$|The study {{explored}} the decisions women made {{in relation to}} mode of birth following a previous <b>emergency</b> <b>lower</b> segment caesarean section (emLSCS), particularly focusing on what different factors influenced women to choose a particular mode of birth and what they described as the rationale underpinning that decision. Participants were recruited from a population of students and staff within the School of Human and Health Sciences at a university {{in the north of}} England. Sixteen individuals were selected using convenience sampling, who then completed open-ended questionnaires. The questions were non-leading and asked the women to identify and expand upon factors that influenced their decision on mode of birth. Data were analysed using a basic thematic framework analysis. Many of the identified themes mirrored those well recognised in existing research: the woman’s previous birth, her perception of risks, the influence of professionals and the influence of peers were all apparent. One factor not explored in existing literature, namely a sense of duty to existing children, appeared to be strongly influential in this data set. Interestingly, it was observed that each woman’s philosophical framework and her relationship with the element of control substantially underpinned her consideration of key factors, leading her to an individual decision. This article provides an interesting insight into the complexity of individual decision making in maternity care. The findings highlight the fact that professional guidelines may fail to meet the personal and individual needs of their subjects.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} the inventory rationing {{problem in a}} multi-echelon system for spare parts with multiple demand classes at warehouses in the highest echelon. The service provider has two types of contracts for its spares supply service: the performance-based contracts(PBCs) and the traditional transactional contracts. In PBCs, the service provider is heavily penalized for stock-out events and obliged to procure <b>emergency</b> supply from <b>lower</b> echelons to meet the customer demand. On the other hand, for the transactional con-tracts, the cost of stock-out events is much less and <b>emergency</b> transshipment from <b>lower</b> echelon is not a cost-effective option for the service provider. We propose an inventory rationing policy {{that is based on}} customer critical levels and uses the aggregate on-hand inventory level at the local warehouses to make rationing decisions. We model the multi-echelon system using continuous-time Markov chains and perform numerical experiments to analyze the cost sav-ings of the proposed policy under different demand and cost structures. The results suggest that inventory rationing can significantly reduce the total cost, especially when the holding and transportation costs are high...|$|R
