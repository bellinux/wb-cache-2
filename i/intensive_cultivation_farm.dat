The objectives of this research were to examine the possibility of application of reduced corn cultivation; analyze statistical variation elements (length, circumference and weight of corn cob); and determine cost effectiveness of reduced relative to intensive production. The results indicate extremely high statistically significant difference (p< 0. 001) for all parameters in both cultivation methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to assess the soil quality by aggregate indices using the Relative Soil Quality Index (RSQI) proposed by Ho Ngoc Pham. RSQI is integrated from the individual indices into a simple formula for overall assessment of the soil quality. RSQI is different from other approaches. Particularly, the individual indices and the weighting factors of Pham are calculated from the analytical laboratory data and the environmental standards, respectively, and not self-regulated as in methods of some other authors. In this paper, the authors applied the RSQI to assess the Soil Environmental Quality of rice <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> areas through a case study in Haiduong province in 2013. The RSQI is calculated for sampling points in 12 districts and simulated the Soil Environmental Quality on GIS map. The results show that the Soil Environmental Quality of rice <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> areas in Haiduong is predominantly divided into three levels: good, moderate, and poor. According to the report of General Statistics Office for Haiduong province, rice <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> areas in 2013 achieved a relatively high average rice yield of 5. 90 tonnes per hectare; it means actual soil properties are in line with results of the research...|$|R

40|$|The Land and Forestland Allocation Policy of Lao PDR {{has been}} in effect {{throughout}} the country since 1996. The two main aims of the policy are to increase land tenure security {{in order to encourage}} farmer’s involvement in intensive farming to result in more prosperous livelihoods, and to eliminate slash and burn cultivation in an attempt to protect natural resources and the environment. This paper examines the implementation of the policy in two communities, both of which are located along the foothills of Phou Khao Khouay National Protected Area. After the Land and Forestland Allocation Policy banned shifting <b>cultivation,</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> was required, and the traditional tenure system was replaced by one codified in law. Lands were zoned for agriculture activities and distributed to villagers according to traditional tenure. In order to retain tenure, villagers must show some agriculture activity or intensive development on the parcels within three years or the land will be returned to the state. This paper analyzes economic conditions, livelihoods, land use practices, and food security, and recommends that the ironic effect of farmers returning to protected forests in order to invest in the land they have received from the Land and Forestland Allocation Program {{is due to the fact}} that they are not secure with the rights they have gained to use this land. Until the Lao government gives villagers secure rights to agricultural and forestlands that cannot be revoked in three years, villagers will continue to engage in illegal activities on protected forests...|$|R
