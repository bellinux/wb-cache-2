50|$|The NV-301 and NV-701 were {{probably}} the top-of-the-range {{models of the}} NV series. Both shared a three-layered <b>half-mirrored</b> sleek design, the main difference mainly lay in the specification of the two systems. The NV-301 was the basic model with two speakers and with a simple phono input (marked for MiniDisc and DVD players) while the NV-701 was a 5.1 Dolby surround sound model with A/V inputs. Both featured a three-disc carousel, a cassette player with Dolby B noise reduction, a natural display, intelligent features {{and the ability to}} save up to 40 radio stations. Kenwood had clearly taken huge advantage of microcomputers as evident in the functions that are featured; had old methods been used, the NV-301/701 would have been much larger. These features had never been matched by other manufacturers, with other designs being rather crude by comparison.|$|R
50|$|Dan Graham’s artworks {{are said}} to blur the line between {{sculpture}} and architecture. Since the 1980s, Graham {{has been working on}} an ongoing series of freestanding, sculptural objects called pavilions; they represent a hybrid between a quasi-functional space and an installation that serves to expose processes of perception and certain expectations. Graham's popularity has grown since he started his walk-in pavilions and he has received commissions all over the world. His pavilions are steel and glass sculptures which create a different space which disorients the viewer from his or her usual surroundings or knowledge of space. They are made of a few huge panes of glass or mirror, or of <b>half-mirrored</b> glass that is both reflective and transparent. Graham often experiments with optics in his designs, utilising convex two-way mirrors, fish-eye lenses, and small pools of water to reflect the pavilion’s interior, including the tondos, the visitors and the sky outside the pavilion. Wooden lattice and steel are other materials most commonly used in his work.|$|R

Formally, we {{address the question of}} how to obtain an invariant 3 D projective representation from a dynamic collection of cameras. We show that the maximal generality is reached when the rig consists of 5 cameras whose center of projection remain fixed relative to each other during the motion. In other words, the non-rigid component motion may consist of change of internal parameters and relative camera orientations. The configuration reduces to 3 views when the Rig is built using a single physical camera with <b>half-mirrors</b> (beam-splitters) for creating 3 distinct views. We also briefly discuss 2 -view configurations using halfmirrors and the principle behind adapting the configuration to allow for zoom lenses in the system. The new research [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Ohsawa et al. [34] {{proposed}} a one-shot 6 -band HDTV camera system. In their system, {{the light is}} divided into two optical paths by a <b>half-mirror</b> and is incident on two conventional CCD cameras after transmission through the specially designed interference filters inserted in each optical path. The two HDTV cameras capture three-band images in sync to compose each frame of the six band image. The total spectral sensitivities of the six band camera are the combination of spectral characteristics of the optical components: the objective lens, the <b>half-mirror,</b> the IR cutoff filter, the interference filters, the CCD sensors, etc. This system needs custom designed filters and complex optics making it still far from being practical.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calibration and rectification method for single-camera range estimation using a single complex image with a transparent plate or a doublesided <b>half-mirror</b> plate, which are collectively called a reflection stereo. The range to an object is obtainable by finding the correspondence on a constraint {{line in the}} complex image, which consists of a surface and a rear-surface reflected image in the transparent plate, or also includes a transmitted and internal reflected image through a double-sided <b>half-mirror</b> plate. The range estimation requires extrinsic parameters of the reflection stereo that include the shape and position of the plate and its refraction index. The proposed method assumes that the plate is non-parallel but planar for a local region around the point {{of interest in the}} complex image. The method estimates the extrinsic parameters from a set of displacements in the complex images. Experiments using real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration and rectification method along with fine range estimation results. 1...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of natural}} light in {{building}} structures can increase energy efficiency and lead to more sustainable architecture. To encourage such {{use of natural}} light, a dual experimental device is being developed at MIT to help {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various daylighting approaches, {{to be used as a}} goniophotometer for materials and coatings analysis and as a heliodon for studying scale models. The goniophotometer will be used to conduct detailed assessments of the bidirectional transmission or reflecting distribution function ("BT(R) DF") properties of building materials, using a CCD camera to produce a luminance map of the emerging light distribution. The heliodon mode will be used to as an educational tool to perform qualitative evaluations of shadow patterns by simulating sunlight illumination on scale models. This thesis focuses on several aspects of this larger project. This thesis first describes the design of an illumination system appropriate for both functions of the joint goniophotometer/heliodon. (cont.) This thesis then describes the design and manufacture of a light collection system for the goniophotometer mode, specifically the design and fabrication of an acrylic semi-ellipsoid with a <b>half-mirrored</b> coating that focuses the collected light at the CCD camera used for collection and analysis. Finally, this thesis describes the calibration of the light detection system (the color CCD camera) to make its spectral sensitivity match that of the human eye. With this calibration, the CCD camera will be useful not only as a component of the goniophotometer/heliodon system, but may also be adapted to serve as a freestanding multi-point luminance meter for the characterization of BT(R) DFs for various materials of interest. by Courtney A.

40|$|Advanced {{fenestration}} {{systems are}} increasingly being used to distribute solar radiation purposefully in buildings. Distribution of visible light and near infrared radiation can be optimized to enhance daylighting and reduce thermal loads. Light redirecting window systems are one of many innovative fenestration systems available for improving the daylighting and thermal performance of buildings. Many emerging and existing light redirecting systems have both spectrally and angularly selective optical properties. To study these properties, a device that measures the spectral, bi-directional transmission and reflection distribution functions of complex fenestration systems is being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This device, a goniophotometer, will measure photometric and radiometric BT(R) DFs for radiation of 380 to 1700 nanometer wavelengths, encompassing much of the solar spectrum. The device incorporates spectroradiometrically calibrated digital cameras and absorption filters to gather quasi-spectral information about reflection and transmission by complex fenestration systems. It relies on a <b>half-mirrored,</b> aluminum coated acrylic hemi-ellipsoid to project reflected or transmitted light towards a digital camera. (cont.) The device {{will be able to}} characterize BT(R) DFs for a variety of fenestration system materials, assemblies, and building materials. The goal of this research is to support the development of innovative, spectrally and angularly selective window systems that can improve daylighting and comfort and/or reduce cooling and heating loads in buildings. This thesis focuses on calibrating digital cameras to measure radiances with unknown spectra, developing the hemi-ellipsoid for the new goniophotometer, and developing methods for constructing quasi-spectral BT(R) DFs using this new device. The calibrated cameras also have potential for use in other applications, for example, as radiometers and photometers in rooms with light of known spectra. by Nicholas Gayeski. Thesis (S. M.)

The overlay system is mounted non-invasively on the gantry of the CT scanner and {{it consists of}} a seven degrees-of-freedom passive mounting arm, a flat LCD display, and a light brown acrylic plate as a half mirror. In a pre-operative calibration process, the display, <b>half-mirror,</b> and imaging plane of the scanner are spatially registered by imaging a triangular calibration object. Following the calibration, the patient is brought into the scanner, an image is acquired {{and sent to the}} overlay display via DICOM transfer. Looking at the patient through the <b>half-mirror,</b> the CT image appears to be floating inside the patient in correct size and position. This vision enables the physician to see both the surface and the inside of the patient at the same time, which can be utilized in guiding a surgical intervention. The complete system fits into a carry-on suitcase (except the mounting adapter), it is easy to calibrate, mounts non-invasively on the scanner, without utilizing vendor-specific features of he scanner. ...|$|E

However, the underlying neural mechanism for such interactions {{has not yet been}} revealed. This article introduces a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) hyperscanning system to examine brain-to-brain interactions between a mother and her child. We used two whole-head MEG systems placed in the same magnetically-shielded room. One is a 160 -channel gradiometer system for an adult and the other is a 151 -channel gradiometer system for a child. We developed an audio-visual presentation system, which enabled a mother and her child to look at each other in real time. In each MEG system, a video camera was placed behind a <b>half-mirror</b> screen for visual presentation to obtain the subjects’ facial expressions. The visual presentation system is capable of displaying not only real-time facial expression but also processed facial expression such as a still face or delayed facial expressions. A projector system displays the side-by-side face images of the mother and child, and the images are divided into each face using splitting mirrors and each face is displayed on the <b>half-mirror</b> screen {{in front of the other}} subject. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first MEG hyperscanning system in a single shielded room, and may contribute to elucidating brain-to-brain interactions not only between a mother and her child but also in general inter-individual, brain-to-brain interactions...|$|E
40|$|In this lecture for the Nobel symposium, {{we review}} {{previous}} research on a class of translational-invariant insulators without spin-orbit coupling. These may be realized in intrinsically spinless systems such as photonic crystals and ultra-cold atoms. Some of these insulators have no time-reversal symmetry as well, i. e., the relevant symmetries are purely crystalline. Nevertheless, topological phases exist which are distinguished by their robust surface modes. To describe these phases, we introduce the notions of (a) a halved-mirror chirality: an integer invariant which characterizes <b>half-mirror</b> planes in the 3 D Brillouin zone, and (b) a bent Chern number: the traditional Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs invariant generalized to bent 2 D manifolds. Like other well-known topological phases, their band topology is unveiled by the crystalline analog of Berry phases, i. e., parallel transport across certain non-contractible loops in the Brillouin zone. We also identify certain topological phases without any robust surface modes - they are uniquely distinguished by parallel transport along bent loops, whose shapes {{are determined by the}} symmetry group. Finally, we describe the Weyl semimetallic phase that intermediates two distinct, gapped phases. Comment: A review for the Nobel symposiu...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResults {{of earlier}} {{multiple}} object tracking (MOT) studies imply that humans can track several moving targets in a 2 D environment simultaneously. Recently, a study suggested that stereoscopic depth has {{positive effect on}} tracking multiple objects when the objects are presented separately on multiple planes. However, it remains unclear whether or not humans can track moving targets in a real 3 D environment. In this study, we investigated this issue displaying four targets and four distractors on near and/or far depth planes separated physically by 6, 10 or 50 cm using a <b>half-mirror</b> and two CRT-monitors. In addition we also tested whether participants could track the targets when either a target or a distractor changed depth during tracking. Our results suggested that performance dropped if the targets were presented on both depth planes especially when {{the distance between the}} planes was 50 cm. In addition, participants could track a depth-changed target if targets were presented on both planes before the start of a motion phase regardless of whether the initial state of targets distribution randomly varied or not, whereas they failed to track the target if all targets were presented on a single plane before MOT. In conclusion, humans have the ability to set attention on a wide range for MOT in a real 3 D environment, with the provision that the efficiency of the tracking is critically dependent not only on the distance in depth but also on an initial state of distribution of the targets without the predictability of the initial state...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{streamer}} discharges are influenced by background ionization and other effects of previous discharges 1. Also externally applied background ionization can have a great influence on streamer propagation and morphology 2. In a newly designed experiment we have studied the influence of repeating positive streamer discharges by applying two subsequent high voltage pulses with a variable interval between them. The pulse-to-pulse interval was varied between 200 ns and 40 ms so that a large range of effects could be observed for three different gases: artificial air, pure nitrogen and pure argon. The discharges are studied with two ICCD cameras which image the same area by means of a <b>half-mirror.</b> Each camera is gated so that it images the streamer propagation during either the first or the second voltage pulse. Experiments have been performed in a 103 mm point-plane gap at a pressure of 133 mbar. We have found a range of phenomena that depend on the inter-pulse time ¿t. These phenomena occur in all three different gasses, although their timing. For small values of ¿t, (roughly below 1 µs for air and nitrogen and below 15 µs for argon) we observe that the streamers just continue their old paths. If they did not cross the gap during the first pulse, they will travel further where they stopped during the first pulse. At larger values of ¿t the conductivity of the old channels has decreased too much and streamers no longer continue on the old paths. However, parts of the old paths do glow up again like secondary streamers. At still larger values of ¿t (roughly above 2. 5 µs for air and 30 µs for nitrogen, for argon this is less determined) new streamer channels appear. At first they avoid the entire area of the previous discharge; next they follow the edges of the old channels; then they start to follow the old channels exactly and finally (with ¿t in the order of (tens of) milliseconds) they become fully independent of the old paths. These experiments give insight in the effects of leftover ionization and other species on subsequent discharges. 1. S. Nijdam, G. Wormeester, E. M. van Veldhuizen and U.
