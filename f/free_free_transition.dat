40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{stability}} {{analysis of a}} laminar airfoil is presented and compared to turbulent flow conditions. The flutter system with the two degrees-of-freedom heave and pitch is introduced. The aerodynamic derivatives due to a pitch motion are identified experimentally and two Doublet Lattice correction methods are {{used to determine the}} aerodynamic derivatives due to a heave motion. The correction is applied to the local pressure distributions and includes nonlinearities due to transonic flow as well as transitional effects. The resulting aerodynamic derivatives reflect the differences between laminar and turbulent flow as measured in the experiment. An influence of the mean angle-of-attack on the stability boundary is shown for <b>free</b> <b>transition.</b> A comparison of the flutter boundaries for <b>free</b> and fixed <b>transition</b> exhibits a lower transonic dip for <b>free</b> <b>transition.</b> One-degree-of-freedom flutter is found only for <b>free</b> <b>transition...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{compute the}} Γ-sectors and Γ-Euler–Satake {{characteristic}} of a closed, effective 2 -dimensional orbifold Q where Γ is a <b>free</b> or <b>free</b> abelian group. Using this information, we determine a family of orbifolds such that the complete collection of Γ-Euler–Satake characteristics associated to <b>free</b> and <b>free</b> abelian groups determines the number and type of singular points of Q {{as well as the}} Euler characteristic of the underlying space. Additionally, we show that any collection of these groups whose Euler–Satake characteristics determine this information contains both <b>free</b> and <b>free</b> abelian groups of arbitrarily large rank. It follows that the collection of Euler–Satake characteristics associated to <b>free</b> and <b>free</b> abelian groups constitute a finer orbifold invariant than the collection of Euler–Satake characteristics associated to <b>free</b> groups or <b>free</b> abelian groups alone...|$|R
