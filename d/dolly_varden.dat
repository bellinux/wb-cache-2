5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E

25|$|Sport {{fishing is}} another {{important}} local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen exploiting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|E
5000|$|... 1880s — The <b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens,</b> an all-female, African-American {{team from}} Chester, Pennsylvania, was {{assembled}} by barber-turned-sports entrepreneur John Lang in the 1880s {{as a team}} that played for the entertainment of spectators.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens</b> was a {{recurring}} name {{used for a}} number of baseball teams throughout the United States {{in the early decades of}} base ball (1860s-1880s). Most were white, male squads, though there was an all-female, African-American team from Chester PA, assembled by barber-turned-sports entrepreneur John Lang in the 1880s. However, the latter team was considered a novelty, rather than a competitive organization, who played for the entertainment of spectators. (MLB official historian John Thorn notes, [...] "Lang’s <b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens,</b> created in the 1880s, are sometimes confused with several Philadelphia-area all-male clubs bearing that name as early as 1867.") ...|$|R

25|$|Among American {{species of}} charr, the kype reaches its maximum {{size in the}} large {{anadromous}} males, <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> trout (Salvelinus malma) and Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), whereas it is reportedly hardly visible or absent in large nonanadromous males, Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush).|$|E
25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} competitive exclusion was observed to occur between <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> charr (Trout)(Salvelinus malma) and white spotted char (Trout)(S. leucomaenis) in Japan. Both {{of these species}} were morphologically similar but the former species was found primarily at higher elevations than the latter. Although there was a zone of overlap, each species excluded the other from its dominant region by becoming better adapted to its habitat over time. In some such cases, each species gets displaced into an exclusive segment of the original habitat. Because each species suffers from competition, natural selection favors the avoidance of competition in such a way.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} burbot and {{northern}} pike, {{most of the}} large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are salmonids. Four species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, sockeye, coho and chum) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the Pacific and Yukon River watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse. There are also land-locked kokanee (sockeye salmon) and rainbow trout. chars are represented by lake trout present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> bull trout and Arctic char. The Arctic grayling is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various whitefish and inconnu.|$|E
50|$|Women have a {{long history}} in American {{baseball}} and many women's teams have existed over the years. Baseball was played at women's colleges in New York and New England as early as the mid-nineteenth century; teams were formed at Vassar College, Smith College, Wellesley College, and Mount Holyoke College. An African American women's team, the Philadelphia <b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens,</b> was formed in 1867.|$|R
6000|$|And {{what have}} you {{hitherto}} asked of them?--Ramsgate Sands, and <b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens,</b> and the Paddington Station,--these, I think, are typical of your chief demands; the cartoons of Raphael--which you don't care to see themselves; and, {{by way of a}} flight into the empyrean, the Madonna di San Sisto. And literally, there are hundreds of cities and villages in Italy in which roof and wall are blazoned with the noblest divinity and philosophy ever imagined by men; and of all this treasure, I can, as far as I know, give you not one example, in line engraving, by an English hand! ...|$|R
5000|$|Fishing {{season has}} begun and park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore goes {{out on the}} lake {{to check on the}} anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it. Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing. When the bear tells him {{that he is going to}} catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to [...] "Go fish like a bear!" [...] At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an {{envelope}} of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as <b>dolly</b> <b>vardens</b> and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil.|$|R
500|$|Fish species {{found in}} the bay are: Chinook, chum, sockeye, pink and coho salmon, halibut, trout, steelhead, <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> lingcod, whitefish, blackfish, char and herring. As for shellfish, there are Dungeness crabs, scallops, shrimp and clams. [...] Salmon are very {{important}} food of bears, particularly {{in the late summer}} and fall. In {{the southern part of the}} bay, there are streams which abound in salmon. They are also seen colonizing in the northern bay, consequent to the retreat of many glaciers and the streams emerging. These salmon food sources are expected to support more bear populations in the years ahead.|$|E
500|$|In 1880, the Salmon Creek {{was named}} by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau (during their {{first visit to}} the area for gold prospecting). The local people called it Tilhini meaning [...] "dog salmon" [...] a native name used by Tingit Alaskan Indian; this name is also shown in some early {{topographic}} maps. In 1917, fish propagation was established in Salmon Creek Reservoir by introducing 50,000 fry lings (small and young recently hatched fish) in the reservoir with assistance from Alaska Fish and Game Club, which maintained a hatchery at Juneau. This helped in propagating fish reserves of Salmon in the reservoir. It is reported that by the time the lake was opened for fishing, the fish measured [...] and could be caught with a fly of [...] Salmon Creek Reservoir is now open for bait fishing all the year round. Salmon fish varieties are many. Some fish species identified are: <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> Brook Trout, Freshwater Trout, Salmon family, Chum Salmon and Coho Salmon.|$|E

60|$|Do not let us abuse vanity, therefore. Rather let us use it. Honor {{itself is}} but the highest form of vanity. The {{instinct}} {{is not confined}} solely to Beau Brummels and <b>Dolly</b> <b>Vardens.</b> There is the vanity of the peacock and the vanity of the eagle. Snobs are vain. But so, too, are heroes. Come, oh! my young brother bucks, let us be vain together. Let us join hands and help each other to increase our vanity. Let us be vain, not of our trousers and hair, but of brave hearts and working hands, of truth, of purity, of nobility. Let us be too vain to stoop to aught that is mean or base, too vain for petty selfishness and little-minded envy, too vain to say an unkind word or do an unkind act. Let us be vain of being single-hearted, upright gentlemen {{in the midst of}} a world of knaves. Let us pride ourselves upon thinking high thoughts, achieving great deeds, living good lives.|$|R

2500|$|The park is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for hikers and mountain climbers, as well as swimmers, canoeists, and kayakers. There is an extensive network of hiking trails in the park; visitor facilities are located at Buttle Lake and Forbidden Plateau. The park includes campgrounds, backpacking and cross-country skiing trails, and downhill skiing. There is fishing, in season, for cutthroat, rainbow, and <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> trout. [...] Campfires are banned {{in all areas of}} the park except in provided fire pits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brook trout}} was first scientifically {{described}} as Salmo fontinalis by the naturalist Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1814. The specific epithet [...] "fontinalis" [...] {{comes from the}} Latin for [...] "of a spring or fountain", {{in reference to the}} clear, cold streams and ponds in its native habitat. The species was later moved to the char genus Salvelinus. Though commonly called a trout, the brook trout is thus actually one of the chars, which in North America also include the lake trout, bull trout, <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> and the Arctic char.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} myth, most beaver dams do not pose {{barriers}} to trout and salmon migration, {{although they may}} be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. In a meta-review of studies claiming that beaver dams act as fish passage barriers, Kemp et al. found that 78% of these claims were not supported by any data. In a 2013 study of radiotelemetry-tagged Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki utah) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Utah, both of these fish species crossed beaver dams in both directions, including dams up to [...] high. Rainbow, brown, and brook trout {{have been shown to}} cross as many as 14 consecutive beaver dams. Both adults and juveniles of coho salmon, steelhead trout, sea run cutthroat (Oncorhyncus clarki clarki), <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> trout (Salvelinus malma malma), and sockeye salmon are able to cross beaver dams. In southeast Alaska, coho jumped dams as high as two meters, were found above all beaver dams and had their highest densities in streams with beaver. In Oregon coastal streams, beaver dams are ephemeral and almost all wash out in high winter flows only to be rebuilt every summer. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) may be limited by beaver dams, but the presence of juveniles upstream from the dams suggests that the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows. Two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.|$|E
60|$|And {{yet here}} was this same <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> so {{whimsical}} and hard to please that she was <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> still, all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks, and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who {{at that very moment}} were breaking their hearts to marry her, than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards.|$|E

60|$|In Uriah Heap and Mrs. Gummidge, Dickens draws types {{rather than}} characters. Pecksniff, Podsnap, <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> Mr. Bumble, Mrs. Gamp, Mark Tapley, Turveydrop, Mrs. Jellyby--these are not characters; they are human {{characteristics}} personified.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding this uncivil exhortation, Miggs gladly {{did as she}} was required; {{and told}} him how that their young mistress, being alone in the meadows after dark, had been {{attacked}} by three or four tall men, who would have certainly borne her away and perhaps murdered her, but for the timely arrival of Joseph Willet, who with his own single hand put them all to flight, and rescued her; to the lasting admiration of his fellow-creatures generally, and to the eternal love and gratitude of <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden.</b>|$|E
60|$|You have in {{that book}} an entirely profitless and monstrous story, in which the {{principal}} characters are a coxcomb, an idiot, a madman, a savage blackguard, a foolish tavern-keeper, a mean old maid, and a conceited apprentice,--mixed up with a certain quantity of ordinary operatic pastoral stuff, about a pretty Dolly in ribbons, a lover with a wooden leg, and an heroic locksmith. For these latter, the only elements of good, or life, in the filthy mass of the story,[BM] observe that the author must filch the wreck of those old times of which we fiercely and frantically destroy every living vestige, whenever it is possible. You cannot have your <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> brought up behind the counter of a railway station; nor your jolly locksmith trained at a Birmingham brass-foundry. And of these materials, observe that you can only have the ugly ones illustrated. The cheap popular art cannot draw for you beauty, sense, or honesty; and for <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> or the locksmith, you will look through the vignettes in vain. But every species of distorted folly and vice,--the idiot, the blackguard, the coxcomb, the paltry fool, the degraded woman,--are pictured for your honorable pleasure in every page, with clumsy caricature, struggling to render its dullness tolerable by insisting on defect,--if perchance a penny or two more may be coined out of the Cockney reader's itch for loathsomeness.|$|E
60|$|Already she {{has given}} names to most of them. The cock is Peter, of course. A much-speckled hen is <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden.</b> A slim, trim thing that dogs Peter's heels she calls Cleopatra. Another hen--the mellowest-voiced one of all--she {{addresses}} as Bernhardt. One thing I have noted: whenever she and the steward have passed death sentence on a non-laying hen (which occurs regularly once a week), she takes no part in the eating of the meat, not {{even when it is}} metamorphosed into one of her delectable curries. At such times she has a special curry made for herself of tinned lobster, or shrimp, or tinned chicken.|$|E
60|$|In the mind's eye of Mr Willet, the West Indies, {{and indeed}} all foreign countries, were {{inhabited}} by savage nations, who were perpetually burying pipes of peace, flourishing tomahawks, and puncturing strange patterns in their bodies. He no sooner heard this announcement, therefore, than {{he leaned back}} in his chair, took his pipe from his lips, and stared at his son with as much dismay as if he already beheld him tied to a stake, and tortured for the entertainment of a lively population. In what form of expression his feelings would have found a vent, it is impossible to say. Nor is it necessary: for, before a syllable occurred to him, <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> came running into the room, in tears, threw herself on Joe's breast without a word of explanation, and clasped her white arms round his neck.|$|E
60|$|At {{the close}} of the voyage to America (a very bad and {{dangerous}} one), a meeting of the passengers, with Lord Mulgrave in the chair, took place, and a piece of plate and thanks were voted to the captain of the Britannia, Captain Hewett. The vote of thanks, being drawn up by Charles Dickens, is given here. We have letters in this year to Mr. Thomas Hood, Miss Pardoe, Mrs. Trollope, and Mr. W. P. Frith. The last-named artist--then a very young man--had made great success with several charming pictures of <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden.</b> One of these was bought by Charles Dickens, who ordered a companion picture of Kate Nickleby, from the young painter, whose acquaintance he made at the same time; and the two letters to Mr. Frith have reference to the purchase of the one picture and the commission for the other.|$|E
60|$|He {{had very}} little money in his pocket; so little indeed, that after paying for his breakfast (which he was too honest and perhaps too proud to score up to his father's charge) he had but a penny left. He had courage, notwithstanding, to resist all the affectionate importunities of the serjeant, who waylaid {{him at the door}} with many protestations of eternal friendship, and did in {{particular}} request that he would do him the favour to accept of only one shilling as a temporary accommodation. Rejecting his offers both of cash and credit, Joe walked away with stick and bundle as before, bent upon getting through the day as he best could, and going down to the locksmith's in the dusk of the evening; for it should go hard, he had resolved, but he would have a parting word with charming <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He knew, {{though he}} could not {{remember}} that he had ever been told, that a certain faded, wistful face, that looked at him from a plush and gilt framed daguerreotype above the mantel of the [...] "sitting-room," [...] was the face of his mother. But that knowledge did not touch his dim memories with any elucidation. In that photograph she was a girlish figure, leaning against a photographer's stile, and with all the self-conscious shrinking natural to that position. She had curly hair and a face far younger and prettier than any other mother in his experience. She swung a <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> hat by the string, and looked with obedient respectful eyes on the photographer-gentleman who had commanded the pose. She was very slight and pretty. But the phantom mother that haunted his memory so elusively was not like that, {{though he could}} not remember how she differed. Perhaps she was older, or a little less shrinking, or, it may be, only dressed in a different way....|$|E
60|$|After this, {{came the}} dinner {{and the letter}} writing, and some more talking, {{in the course of}} which Miss Haredale took {{occasion}} to charge upon Dolly certain flirtish and inconstant propensities, which accusations Dolly seemed to think very complimentary indeed, and to be mightily amused with. Finding her quite incorrigible in this respect, Emma suffered her to depart; but not before she had confided to her that important and never-sufficiently-to-be-taken-care-of answer, and endowed her moreover with a pretty little bracelet as a keepsake. Having clasped it on her arm, and again advised her half in jest and half in earnest to amend her roguish ways, for she knew she was fond of Joe at heart (which Dolly stoutly denied, with a great many haughty protestations that she hoped she could do better than that indeed! and so forth), she bade her farewell; and after calling her back to give her more supplementary messages for Edward, than anybody with tenfold the gravity of <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> could be reasonably expected to remember, at length dismissed her.|$|E
60|$|But {{the air of}} smartness, the cock of the hat {{to which}} John Willet had objected, and the spring nosegay, all betokened some little errand of his own, having a more {{interesting}} object than a vintner or even a locksmith. So, indeed, it turned out; for when he had settled with the vintner--whose place of business was down in some deep cellars hard by Thames Street, and who was as purple-faced an old gentleman {{as if he had}} all his life supported their arched roof on his head--when he had settled the account, and taken the receipt, and declined tasting more than three glasses of old sherry, to the unbounded astonishment of the purple-faced vintner, who, gimlet in hand, had projected an attack upon at least a score of dusty casks, and who stood transfixed, or morally gimleted as it were, to his own wall--when he had done all this, and disposed besides of a frugal dinner at the Black Lion in Whitechapel; spurning the Monument and John's advice, he turned his steps towards the locksmith's house, attracted by the eyes of blooming <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Hugh and a {{small body}} of the rioters cut off from The Warren beckoned to their pals, they forced into a very {{remarkable}} postchaise <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> and Emma Haredale, and bore them away with all possible rapidity; one of their company driving, and the rest running beside the chaise, climbing up behind, sitting on the top, lighting the way with their torches, etc. etc. If you can express the women inside without showing them--as by a fluttering veil, a delicate arm, or so forth appearing at the half-closed window--so much the better. Mr. Tappertit stands on the steps, which are partly down, and, {{hanging on to the}} window with one hand and extending the other with great majesty, addresses a few words of encouragement to the driver and attendants. Hugh sits upon the bar in front; the driver sitting postilion-wise, and turns round to look through the window behind him at the little doves within. The gentlemen behind are also anxious {{to catch a glimpse of}} the ladies. One of those who are running at the side may be gently rebuked for his curiosity by the cudgel of Hugh. So they cut away, sir, as fast as they can.|$|E
