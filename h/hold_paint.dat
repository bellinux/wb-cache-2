5000|$|Dina Delsanto is {{an artist}} who has just been hired to teach the {{advanced}} art class, which has the same students as Jack's writing class. Dina was a successful painter in New York City, but she now has difficulty painting or even walking and engaging in daily activities because of severe rheumatoid arthritis. She can no longer fasten buttons, open medicine bottles or <b>hold</b> <b>paint</b> brushes. She moved to Maine, where her sister and her mother live, {{so that they can}} help her during the spells when her arthritis worsens. As a teacher, she is a perfectionist with no interest in her students' personal lives. She simply wants them to concentrate on creating the best works of art that they can. She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing [...] "truth".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{is often}} said that the {{defining}} trait which separates man from the animals is an opposable thumb. Without the opposable thumb, human beings might never have enjoy the highly civilized, sophisticated, and techno-logical lifestyles. Opposable thumbs are required for efficient gripping of objects as well as handling fine objects, the skill of refining objects It {{is interesting to note}} that a there are species which are similar to humans in brain capacity but lacks in opposable thumb. The chimpanzees due to the lack of an opposable thumb have extremely creating anything more complex than what they already find in their natural surroundings. The emergence of painting, sculpture, and music would have been unthinkable, man require thumbs to <b>hold</b> <b>paint</b> brushes, chisels, and musical instruments. Thus, the opposable thumb to man's uniqueness and development. It has been proposed that the hominid lineage (hominid or Hominidae- which includes humans and the great apes like bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans&lineage means-Derivation or Direct descent from a particular ancestor) began when a group of chimpan-zee-like apes began to throw rocks and clubbing behaviours, This assertion leads to the prediction that the human hand should be adapted for throwing and clubbing. It is shown that the two fundamental human handgrips, first identified by J. R. Napier, and named them as the ‘precision grip ’ and ‘power grip’, represent a throwing grip and a clubbing grip, and provides an evolutionary explana-tion for the two unique grips, and the extensive anatomical remodelling of the hand that made them possible. These results are sup...|$|E
