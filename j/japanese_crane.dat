50|$|The {{small number}} of basic origami folds can be {{combined}} {{in a variety of}} ways to make intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the <b>Japanese</b> paper <b>crane.</b> In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603-1867), has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging and other engineering applications.|$|R

The origami crane (折鶴 orizuru in Japanese) has become a symbol of peace because of this belief and because of a young Japanese girl named Sadako Sasaki. Sadako was exposed to the radiation of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as an infant, and it took its inevitable toll on her health. She was then a hibakusha [...] - [...] an atom bomb survivor. By the time she was twelve in 1955, she was dying of leukemia. Her classmate told her about the legend so, she decided to fold one thousand origami cranes so that she could live. However, when she saw that the other children in her ward were dying, she realized that she would not survive and wished instead for world peace and an end to suffering.|$|E

40|$|The keeping of cranes in captivity, {{either as}} pets or as animals to be fattened for the pot, is evidently {{a very old}} practice. Captive cranes are {{depicted}} {{on the walls of}} the Temple of Deir-el-Barari of the Nile Valley, where cranes are shown walking in stately fashion between slaves. Each crane 2 ̆ 7 s bill is tied down close to its neck, which would upset its balance and thus prevent it from flying away (Whymper, 1909). Armstrong (1979) noted that cranes were apparently domesticated in ancient Greece, and that Plutarch (c. A. D. 46 -c. A. D. 120) mentions the nesting of tame cranes, presumably Eurasian cranes. According to Rothchild (1930), a diary of the Moghul emperor Jenangir (1 605 - 1627) mentions the breeding of sarus cranes in captivity. Additionally, crowned cranes were being maintained in Rome by at least as early as the fifteenth century, and a Eurasian crane was maintained for some 40 years by Leonicus Tomaecus, an Italian professor at Padua, at about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Live specimens of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>crane</b> also reached the Vatican by about the sixteenth century, as a gift from Japanese royalty (Topsell, 1972). Cheng (1981) stated that cranes were raised by Chinese royalty as early as the West Chou dynasty, some 2, 200 years ago...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} said that since the modern art {{theories}} and oil paintings had been introduced into Japan {{in the beginning of}} the Meiji era, animal paintings by Japanese oil painters have been relatively rare. From the 1930 s to the early 1940 s, however, animal subjects in Japanese oil paintings have exceptionally increased both in quality and quantity. Mainly discussing this period, the argument of this paper shows that for some oil painters who were born in Hokkaido, animal subjects were one of the chief ways to meet the requirement of “local color”. IGUSHI Kaichi (1911 - 1955), born in the north-east part of Hokkaido prefecture, often painted animals of his homeland. Some of his works in the 1930 s, paintings of seals or foxes, were interpreted by his contemporaries as a typical representation of his homeland, and the painter himself referred to his own ambition to depict some “local color”. KUNIMATSU Noboru (1907 - 1994), one of the most famous animal painters in Hokkaido, also has included animals such as birds and dogs in his works since the 1930 s. OGAWARA Shu (1911 - 2002) started his career as a surrealist. But in the early 1940 s, as his style was shifted to more north conscious one, he depicted some animals. In order to paint wild cranes from life, UENOYAMA Kiyotsugu (1889 - 1960) explored frozen fields in the east coast of Hokkaido from the mid 1930 s onward. His <b>Japanese</b> <b>crane</b> paintings show disconnection from traditional crane subjects in Japanese-style paintings. Hokkaido prefecture, the northernmost part of Japan, has not only the unique fauna but also some prominent painters who have frequently depicted animal subjects...|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor did not {{normally}} get up until noon, had brunch at about 2pm before {{going back to}} bed for another rest, to be followed up by playing tennis or table tennis, riding his bicycle or his car aimlessly around {{the grounds of the}} palace or listening to his vast collection of Chinese opera records. Puyi become a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat. Puyi's Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects or mice droppings in his food, the cooks were flogged. When Puyi went into the gardens to mediate before a statue of the Buddha, there always had to be complete silence, and as there were two loud <b>Japanese</b> <b>cranes</b> living in the garden, the emperor always had his servants flogged if the cranes made a sound. One day when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: [...] "Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?" [...] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the [...] "glorious" [...] history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace. The Empress Wanrong retreated in seclusion as she became addicted to opium, and her father stopped visiting the Salt Tax Palace as he could not bear to see what she had become. Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi's jerky movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times, as during the interwar period wearing dark glasses in Tianjin was a way of signifying one was a homosexual or bisexual.|$|R

40|$|Time {{proceeds}} inexorably onward, and it {{has been}} 17 years since the first edition of Crane Music was published. During that time more than a billion people {{have been added to the}} earth 2 ̆ 7 s roles, and global warming has increasingly been recognized as a real tlu:oat to our planet 2 ̆ 7 s future. Although during that period a small percentage of Americans have become very rich through advances in technology, expanding markets and globalization, wildlife in general has suffered. Continuing population growth and associated economic and ecological pressures have resulted in greatly increased deforestation, wetland drainage, and destruction of natural habitats. Additionally, global climate changes are bringing on unforeseen massive ecological changes that will have serious effects on crane populations, especially in arctic and alpine regions (Harris, 2008). Downward population trends in wildlife that are associated with these factors are especially apparent among native grassland and wetland-dependent birds; nearly all of North America 2 ̆ 7 s grassland-adapted birds are now in serious continental decline, and probably much the same is true elsewhere in the world. Most of the world 2 ̆ 7 s cranes are also to a large degree dependent on grasslands and wetlands; those that are generally the rarest and most in danger of extinction are the ones most strongly dependent on extensive wetlands. The whooping, Siberian, white-naped, wattled and <b>Japanese</b> (red-crowned) <b>cranes</b> are all strongly wetland-dependent for breeding, and are now among the world 2 ̆ 7 s rarest and most endangered species. On the other hand, some relatively herbivorous and terrestrial species such as the sandhill, Eurasian, demoiselle and blue cranes have learned to take advantage of agricultural technology by incorporating into their diets of native plants various cultivated grains, such as com and wheat in Europe and rice in Asia. As a result these species have exhibited local, regional or even national population increases. Such foraging practices have often brought cranes into conflict with agricultural interests, resulting in economic conflicts and sometime draconian control measures. An overview of the current status of the world 2 ̆ 7 s cranes is perhaps in order, to bring up to date the accounts given earlier in Crane Music, which was written nearly 20 years ago. Includes: Summary of the Cranes of the World and Their Status The Sandhill Crane The Whooping Crane Supplemental References and Bibliographic Note...|$|R
