25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> your fire demon {{next to an}} {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E

500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> your fingers about, you get various little melodies... it amazes me that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E

500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese abacus, {{known as}} the suanpan (算盤, lit. [...] "counting tray"), is {{typically}} [...] tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> them toward the beam, you count their value. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> away, you don't count their value. The suanpan can be reset {{to the starting position}} instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.|$|E

2500|$|This {{method of}} {{combining}} composition and improvisation involved [...] Zorn writing descriptions or ideas on file-cards and arranging them {{to form the}} piece. Zorn described the process in 2003: [...] "I write in moments, in disparate sound blocks, so I find it convenient to store these events on filing cards {{so they can be}} sorted and ordered with minimum effort. Pacing is essential. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> too fast, people tend to stop hearing the individual moments as complete in themselves and more as elements of a sort of cloud effect...

He {{made him look like}} a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes.... Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often.... He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career—a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stood there and let him. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>moved,</b> he was lost." ...|$|R
50|$|This can {{be proven}} {{by setting up}} an {{experiment}} in which you align three cardboard squares with a small hole in the centre of each.

This proves that waves travel in straight lines and this helps to explain how humans see things, among other uses. It has a number of applications in real life as well.|$|R
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." ...|$|E
