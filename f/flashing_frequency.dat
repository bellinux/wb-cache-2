40|$|Quick SSVEP is {{a web-based}} {{application}} that provides easy to setup SSVEP (Steady State Visually Evoked Potential) stimulation interfaces. When a stimulus {{in the visual}} field flashes at a certain frequency, {{there will be an}} increase in the brain activity over the visual cortex at that frequency (and possibly its harmonics), which is called an SSVEP. This phenomenon provides a straightforward way to design a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In an SSVEP-based BCI, different choices shown on the display flash at different known frequencies. When the user looks at the intended choice, the Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows an increase in activity at the <b>flashing</b> <b>frequency</b> of that choice. The BCI can process the EEG, detect the frequency that shows increased activity and thus detect the intended choice of the subject. It can then actuate the command associated with the choice, e. g. typing a letter, switching a light, etc. A fundamental property of such BCI design is that the stimulator which is showing the flashing choices, {{does not have to be}} communicating with the signal processor (in contrast to for example ERP based BCIs), thus allowing the two software components to be decoupled. This application provides a stand-alone web-based SSVEP stimulator that can run on any modern web browser (although Google Chrome is used in development and is recommended for best performance). As of the first version, the application supports text-based choices, with customizable <b>flashing</b> <b>frequency.</b> Note: The performance of the stimulator (the exact frequency of stimulations) highly depends on the machine and the web browser running it.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here investigated two methods of improving productivity in microalgal photobioreactors: applying temperature cycles intended to maximize photosynthesis and minimize respiration, {{and development of}} a mathematical model that predicts improvements in photon utilization using temporal light dilution (flashing). The experiments conducted on diurnal temperature cycles with Dunaliella tertiolecta in 30 -L outdoor photobioreactors showed that a properly chosen temperature cycle can improve mass and energy productivity by 18 % over an identical photobioreactor with a constant temperature. However, excessively large temperature cycle amplitudes reduced productivity. A 4 - 7 % increase in energy content was observed in microalgae exposed to temperature cycles. The physiological reason for this could not be established.

The predominant stimulus used in task-based fMRI in the mouse is electrical stimulation of the paw. Task-based fMRI in mice using visual stimuli remains underexplored, despite visual stimuli being common in human fMRI studies. In this study, we map the mouse brain visual system with BOLD measurements at 9. 4 T using flashing light stimuli with medetomidine anaesthesia. BOLD responses were observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus, the superior colliculus and the primary visual area of the cortex, and were modulated by the <b>flashing</b> <b>frequency,</b> diffuse vs focussed light and stimulus context. Negative BOLD responses were measured in the visual cortex at 10 Hz flashing frequency; but turned positive below 5 Hz. In addition, the use of interleaved snapshot GE-EPI improved fMRI image quality without diminishing the temporal contrast-noise-ratio. Taken together, this work demonstrates a novel methodological protocol in which the mouse brain visual system can be non-invasively investigated using BOLD fMRI...|$|E

The data obtained clearly indicate that among the tested acceptors PPBQ is the best at high <b>flash</b> <b>frequencies.</b> If present at high enough concentration, the PSII turnover efficiency is unaffected by <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> of up to 30 Hz, and at 40 Hz and 50 Hz only a slight decrease by about 5 â€“ 7 % is observed. In contrast, drastic reductions of the O 2 yields by about 40 % and 65 % were found at 50 Hz for DCBQ and FeCy, respectively. Comparison with literature data reveals that PPBQ accepts electrons from QAâˆ’ in PSII membrane fragments with similar efficiency as plastoquinone in intact cells. Our data also confirm that at high flashing rates O 2 evolution is limited by the reactions on the electron-acceptor side of PSII. The relevance of these data to the evolutionary development of the water-splitting complex in PSII and with regard to the potential of artificial water-splitting catalysts is discussed.

40|$|International audienceProductivity of microalgal {{cultivation}} processes is tightly {{related to}} photosynthetic efficiency, {{and therefore to}} light availability at the cell scale. In an agitated, highly turbid suspension, the light signal received by a single phytoplankton cell moving in a dense culture is a succession of flashes. The growth characteristics of microalgae under such dynamic light conditions are thus fundamental information to understand nonlinear properties of the photosynthetic process and to improve cultivation process design and operation. Studies of the long term consequences of dynamic illumination regime on photosynthesis require a very specific experimental set-up where fast varying signals are applied on the long term. In order to investigate the growth response of the unicellular photosynthetic eukaryote Dunaliella salina (Chlorophyceae) to intermittent light exposure, different light regimes using LEDs with the same average total light dose were applied in continuous cultures. Flashing light with different durations of light flashes (Î”t of 30 s, 15 s, 2 s and 0. 1 s) followed by dark periods of variable length (0. 67 â‰¤ L:D â‰¤ 2) yielding <b>flash</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the range 0. 017 - 5 Hz, were compared to continuous illumination.

40|$|The {{study shows}} that climate change does not {{necessarily}} {{lead to an increase}} in lightning as proposed by studies linking lightning to convective cloud top heights, but may reduce lightning. The impact of lightning on air chemistry and on climate is studied using simulation results obtained with a coupled ensemble climate-chemistry model from 1960 to 2020.

The computed <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> distribution over the globe is broadly in agreement with satellite observations, except for some oceanic regions. The results show, different from general expectations, a decrease in lightning activity in a warming climate. The decrease occurs because of less frequent though stronger convective events. Hence lightning decreases in total <b>flash</b> <b>frequency,</b> although individual events produce more lightning. The computed decrease in lightning NOx emissions is overlaid with an increase in sensitivity of ozone production to NOx amounts, which first leads to an increase in lightning ozone until the 1970 s and then to a decrease.

Objective: The primary aim {{of the study was to}} compare the efficacy of 25 g of isoflavone soy protein versus placebo twice per day in altering hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> and severity among postmenopausal women. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is an ancillary analysis among a subset of 101 postmenopausal women participanting of the Women's Isoflavone Soy Health (WISH) trial, who experienced 5 or more hot flashes per week at baseline. WISH was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center trial including 350 healthy postmenopausal women. designed to evaluate the effect of isoflavon soy on the carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). The study participants were between the ages of 44 to 72 years with no clinically evident ardiovascular disease (CVD). Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to 25 g soy isoflavone product containing 85 mg of isoflavones (45 mg genistein, 35 mg daidzein and 5 mg glycitein) or milk protein matched placebo (0 mg isoflavones) daily for 2. 5 - 3 years. Main Outcome Measures: Among the 101 participants with at least 5 weekly flashes at baseline, the primary endpoints were the <b>frequency</b> of hot <b>flashes</b> and hot flash composite scores calculated from the product of the daily frequency and severity rating using flushing diaries completed over the trial. Secondary outcome measures included the change in hot flashes number and composite scores from baseline.; Results: Of the 101 postmenopausal women, 53 subjects were randomly assigned to isoflavone soy protein (ISP) and 48 subjects were assigned to placebo. The treatment groups did not significantly differ on the daily number of hot flashes, composite scores, or the change in hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> or composite scores over the trial. The reduction in mean hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> from baseline to 30 months was similar for the ISP (1. 33 /day) and the placebo group (1. 33 /day). Among ISP-treated women, the change in plasma glycitein from baseline was inversely associated with the change in hot flash severity (gamma = - 0. 35, p= 0. 02); this association was not observed in the placebo group.

Methods: The ACUFLASH study was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms, conducted in 2006 - 2007. The 267 participants were postmenopausal women experiencing, on average, 12. 6 hot flashes per 24 hours. The acupuncture group received 10 individualized acupuncture treatments during 12 weeks and advice on self-care, and the control group received advice on self-care only. Hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity (0 - 10 scale) and hours of sleep per night were registered in a diary. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Womenâ€Ÿs Health Questionnaire. Results: From baseline to six months, the mean reduction in hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> per 24 hours was 5. 3 in the acupuncture group and 5. 0 in the control group, a non-significant difference of 0. 3.

40|$|This {{article is}} part of Einar Kristian Borud's PhD thesis, which is {{available}} in Munin: [URL] Objective: The previously published ACUFLASH study compared the effectiveness of individualized acupuncture treatment plus self-care versus self-care alone on hot flashes and health-related {{quality of life in}} postmenopausal women. This paper reports on the observational follow-up results at six and 12 months. Methods: The ACUFLASH study was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms, conducted in 2006 - 2007. The 267 participants were postmenopausal women experiencing, on average, 12. 6 hot flashes per 24 hours. The acupuncture group received 10 individualized acupuncture treatments during 12 weeks and advice on self-care, and the control group received advice on self-care only. Hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity (0 - 10 scale) and hours of sleep per night were registered in a diary. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Womenâ€Ÿs Health Questionnaire. Results: From baseline to six months, the mean reduction in hot <b>flash</b> <b>frequency</b> per 24 hours was 5. 3 in the acupuncture group and 5. 0 in the control group, a non-significant difference of 0. 3. At 12 months, the mean reduction in frequency was 6. 0 in the acupuncture group and 5. 8 in the control group, a non-significant difference of 0. 2. Differences in quality of life scores were not statistically significant at six and 12 months. Conclusion: The statistically significant differences between the study groups found at Week 12 were no longer present at six and 12 months. Acupuncture can contribute to a more rapid reduction of vasomotor symptoms and increase in health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women, but probably has no long-term effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} the validity of an original patient symptom diary in recording symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, all patients presenting to the Hotel Dieu hospital emergency eye clinic between September 2008 and July 2009 diagnosed with acute PVD were offered enrollment in the study. Patients were given the Queenâ€™s University posterior vitreous detachment patient diary at the initial visit after detailed eye examination, assessment of risk factors for retinal tears and detachments and a thorough explanation of their presenting complaints to record their symptoms related to PVD. At a random point during their six-week follow up, the patients were verbally asked the same questions being recorded in the diary over the phone. At the six-week follow up visit, the diaries were collected and the verbal results were compared with the written results. ResultsThere was substantial to near perfect agreement between the verbal questions and written answers. Cohenâ€™s kappa scores for <b>flash</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>flash</b> intensity, floater <b>frequency,</b> and floater type were 0. 6229, 0. 6389, 0. 6495, and 0. 8603, respectively. ConclusionsThe Queenâ€™s University posterior vitreous detachment patient diary is a useful tool for investigating the quantity, quality and change in symptoms of patients presenting with PVD in the first 6 weeks of initial presentation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} work {{intended to}} further characterize and develop rear brake light signals likely to improve driver reaction to hard-braking lead-vehicle events, emphasizing unique and novel approaches not previously studied. The work developed optimized signal lighting configurations, including specifications for LED signal approaches (<b>flash</b> <b>frequencies,</b> brightness levels, patterns), and performed field evaluations to assess eye-drawing capability of candidate signals for drivers who were {{looking away from}} the forward view. Results indicate that newer rear signaling designs can be very effective at drawing driversâ€™ eyes back to the forward roadway, and that flashing and brightness are two important signal properties moderating effectiveness (attention-getting). Remarkable performance gains can be achieved via use of LED signal approaches which both flash and increase signal intensity or lamp brightness...|$|R
