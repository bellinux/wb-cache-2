40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> due to slaughter of pregnant camels, {{and the relationship between}} <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> and factors such as breed, season, abattoir location, and age. Pregnancy characteristics of indigenous camels were also investigated. Reproductive tracts were collected from 912 female camels at two abattoirs in southeast Algeria over 2. 5 years. Before slaughter, data regarding reasons for culling were obtained. Pregnancy was detected in 21. 7 % of camels and was higher (P < 0. 05) in the Targui than Sahraoui breed. <b>Fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> was higher (P < 0. 05) in the dry than wet season. <b>Fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> in the first and second trimester (57. 1 % of total waste) was greater (P < 0. 05) than that in third and fourth trimester (42. 9 % of total). Right and left ovaries showed equal ovulatory activity. Mean diameter of the corpus luteum (CL) was higher (P < 0. 05) in females with a single corpus luteum than in those with twin or triple CLs. All but one camel carried the fetus in the left uterine horn. Embryo migration was observed in 50 % of pregnant camels, and migration was from the right to left uterine horn in all cases. Prevalence of embryonic and fetal loss was 10. 0 % and was influenced by ovulation rate. The two most prevalent reasons for culling pregnant camels were old age (23. 7 %) and poor body condition (11. 6 %). These findings document the magnitude of <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> which represents substantial economic loss to the camel industry. Livestock owners should receive education on reproductive management, including pregnancy testing, to minimize <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Although the {{intracellular}} bacterium Listeria monocytogenes has {{an established}} predilection for disseminated infection during pregnancy that {{often results in}} spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, the specific host-pathogen interaction that dictates these disastrous complications remain incompletely defined. Herein, we demonstrate systemic maternal Listeria infection during pregnancy fractures fetal tolerance and triggers <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> in a dose-dependent fashion. Listeria was recovered from the majority of concepti after high-dose infection illustrating the potential for in utero invasion. Interestingly with reduced inocula, <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> occurred without direct placental or fetal invasion, and instead paralleled reductions in maternal Foxp 3 (+) regulatory T cell suppressive potency with reciprocal expansion and activation of maternal fetal-specific effector T cells. Using mutants lacking virulence determinants required for in utero invasion, we establish Listeria cytoplasmic entry is essential for disrupting fetal tolerance that triggers maternal T cell-mediated fetal resorption. Thus, infection-induced reductions in maternal Foxp 3 (+) regulatory T cell suppression with ensuing disruptions in fetal tolerance play critical roles in pathogenesis of immune-mediated <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage...</b>|$|E

40|$|In the {{spectrum}} of adverse effects on the fetus or infant associated with maternal drinking during pregnancy the most dramatic is the fetal alcohol syndrome, a pattern of malformation that {{has been associated with}} maternal alcohol abuse. Other undesirable outcomes of pregnancy linked to alcohol exposure in utero include growth deficiency, major and minor anomalies, decrements in mental and motor performance, and <b>fetal</b> and perinatal <b>wastage.</b> Alcohol, like other teratogens, does not uniformly affect all those exposed to it. Rather, {{there seems to be a}} continuum of effects of alcohol on the fetus with increasingly severe outcomes generally associated with higher intakes of alcohol by the mother.

40|$|SummaryExposure to {{maternal}} tissue during {{in utero}} development imprints tolerance to immunologically foreign non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA) that persists into adulthood. The biological {{advantage of this}} tolerance, conserved across mammalian species, remains unclear. Here, we show maternal cells that establish microchimerism in female offspring during development promote systemic accumulation of immune suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) with NIMA specificity. NIMA-specific Tregs expand during pregnancies sired by males expressing alloantigens with overlapping NIMA specificity, thereby averting <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> triggered by prenatal infection and non-infectious disruptions of fetal tolerance. Therefore, exposure to NIMA selectively enhances reproductive success in second-generation females carrying embryos with overlapping paternally inherited antigens. These findings demonstrate that genetic fitness, canonically thought to be restricted to Mendelian inheritance, is enhanced in female placental mammals through vertically transferred maternal cells that promote conservation of NIMA and enforce cross-generational reproductive benefits...|$|E

Previous studies (Ronco & Alberts, 2000) {{have shown}} that mid-pregnant rat dams exposed to spaceflight (0 -g) and landed 48 - 72 hrs before term successfully delivered robust, healthy offspring Microgravity-exposed dams exhibited twice the expected numbers of labor contractions whereas length of pregnancy, duration of labor, <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage,</b> number of neonates born and litter gender ratios were identical to controls. In the present study, we report the results of rodent pregnancy and parturition {{at the opposite end}} of the gravity spectrum, in hypergravity. Dams exposed to either: 1. 0 -g, 1. 5 -g, 1. 75 -g or 2. 0 -g from Gestational day (G) 11 and throughout the births of their litters had comparable pregnancy and labor durations, <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage,</b> numbers of neonates born and litter Tender ratios. During parturition, hypergravity-exposed dams exhibited significantly fewer labor contractions as compared to 1. 0 -g controls. Dams that underwent birth in hypergravity had significantly fewer offspring surviving the immediate postpartum period (P 1 : 1. 0 -g, 11. 92 +/- 2. 84; 1. 5 -g, 10. 88 +/- 2. 17; 1. 75 -g, 9. 22 +/- 1. 99; 2. 0 -g, 8. 83 +/- 3. 31). Within 24 hrs postpartum, neonatal survival was further diminished in hypergravity [P 2 : 100 % (1. 0 -g); 96 % (1. 5 -g); 96 % (1. 75 -g); 73 % (2. 0 -g) ] and continued to decline (P 10 : 100 %(1. 0 -g.); 90 %(1. 5 -g); 87 %(1. 75 -g), 40 %(2. 0 -g) ]. Neonatal losses stabilized by P 5 for the 1. 5 -g andl. 75 -g conditions but continued until P 9 for the 2. 0 -g condition.

It was noted that low levels of serum complement activity (CH 50 less than 25 U/ml) occurred in five of six patients with fetal loss, but in only two of 22 with a live birth. Serial studies also confirmed a close association between decreased serum complement activity and poor fetal prognosis in lupus pregnancy.

METHODS: In this report, we attempted to neutralize Interleukin 10 by administering anti IL- 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to pregnant mice that have a low background risk for fetal resorptions. The first group of mice was sacrificed on gestation day 18 to study the fetal effects of anti IL- 10 administration. The second group of mice was allowed to deliver to study the effects on the neonatal outcome. RESULTS: Administration of anti IL- 10 mAb did not affect the duration of gestation or the fetal outcome. Neonates exposed to anti IL- 10 mAb in utero showed signs of transient growth deficiency starting at 4 weeks of age that spontaneously corrected by 6 weeks of age.

The evaluation should include a careful gross and microscopic examination of all organs, including the eye, and chromosome banding studies of all organs, including the eye, and chromosome banding studies of at least two cyclopic tissues. Then the presence or absence of multiple causative factors can be better evaluated...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{hospital}} records and death certificates, 91 cases of choriocarcinoma {{were identified in}} the cities of Manila, Quezon, Pasay, and Caloocan in the Philippines during the 5 years 1970 - 74. The overall incidence was 17. 4 per 100 000 live births. The other principal findings in this population-based study concerned maternal age, history of <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage,</b> and number of pregnancies. Very high incidence rates for choriocarcinoma were registered for mothers aged 40 years and over {{and there was a}} slightly higher than average risk for women under 20 years of age. Risk increased with the number of fetal losses. The effect of number of pregnancies was evident only for very old and very young mothers. A case—control study was also conducted on 28 patients with choriocarcinoma and on 187 age-matched controls; for all of these women, the disease had been diganosed (cases) or children had been born (controls) between 1970 and 1975. Compared with the control group, a higher proportion of the case group had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and had previously used contraceptive pills. Because of the low and unequal levels of cooperation among patients and controls, these findings need further confirmation...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies to cardiolipin {{have been}} {{recognized}} in up to 65 % of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. It has been claimed that they are significantly associated with intravascular thrombosis and with obstetrical complications. Thus far they {{have been found to}} be less prevalent in other diseases. Because of the high concentration of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, the authors investigated the prevalence of antibodies to cardiolipin in a group of 31 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. lt was found that the prevalence and levels of anticardiolipin antibodies of lgG and lgA isotype are as high in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis as in 35 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. None of the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis gave any history of venous or arterial thrombosis. The rate of miscarriage was less than that reported for the general population. The availability for study of a second group of patients with high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies should make it possible to determine whether the association of these antibodies with thrombosis and <b>fetal</b> <b>wastage</b> in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is a direct relation ship or an epiphenomenon...|$|E
