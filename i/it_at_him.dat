5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play the puck outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck. Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E
2500|$|One {{police report}} {{described}} that McDonald [...] "raised the knife across chest" [...] and pointed it at Van Dyke. Van Dyke {{told investigators that}} he feared McDonald would rush him with the knife or throw <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he also recalled a 2012 Police Department bulletin warning about a knife that was also capable of firing a bullet, as well as throwing knives and also spring-loaded knives capable of propelling the blade. One report noted that McDonald's knife [...] "was in the open position" [...] but, when announcing charges against Van Dyke, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said the knife was found folded at the scene.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Barclay {{picked up}} a piece of shingle and flung <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Vince {{removed the}} hand that was patting Ruth's {{shoulder}} and waved <b>it</b> reassuringly <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Breaking it open to make sure--then closing <b>it</b> again--looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> suspiciously.] That ain't {{telling me}} why you got it? ...|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{stood for}} a moment quite still. His first emotion was one of dismay, and Cecil, noticing <b>it,</b> laughed <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|By way of answer Rachel {{put the gun}} to her {{shoulder}} and pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|As she thrust <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{his hand}} closed over hers. She felt him drawing her, irresistibly.|$|E
60|$|With {{a sudden}} swift movement, Tommy {{snatched}} the revolver from Julius's hand, and levelled <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Hetty, who, when she fancied {{he would not}} observe <b>it,</b> glanced <b>at</b> <b>him</b> now and then, rode silently beside Grant until he turned to her.|$|R
60|$|Frank moved a pace or two {{nearer the}} dog, {{holding out his}} hand, but speedily retired when <b>it</b> growled <b>at</b> <b>him</b> savagely. After that Jake turned to Harry.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{wanted to}} say his own verses... me and K-Rob read them and started laughing, and we crushed up his paper with the words he had written down and we threw <b>it</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> face first." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sergeant}} groped {{with his}} left hand, and picking up the Japanese sword, held <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Trevor felt in {{his pocket}} for the note, and flung <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Clowes picked it up, and read it gravely.|$|E
6000|$|Cheers and hand-clappings stormed up, and {{she heard}} affectionate cries of [...] "Oh, you, Joe!" [...] Men shouted <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again and again.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] roared Doc Linyard. [...] "Confound {{you for a}} pair of landlubbers! Don't {{you know}} an honest figurehead when you see <b>it?</b> Look <b>at</b> <b>him!</b> 'Pears to me he looks more {{straightforward}} than those as accuses him." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Truefitt {{put out a}} hand {{as though}} to detain him, and then, {{thinking}} better of <b>it,</b> nodded <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with an air of}} great resolution, and puffed furiously at his pipe. Under cover of clouds of smoke he prepared for the encounter.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} mouth, closed <b>it</b> and stared <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> struck by his expression, striving uneasily to fathom hidden depths in his remark.|$|R
6000|$|She {{caught up}} {{a loaf of}} bread and heaved <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He caught it deftly and inquired, guilelessly: [...] "Is this the first of my grub-stake, lassie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Son of a dog!" [...] I said, [...] "if {{a single}} stick touches me, {{at least you}} shall go first," [...] and {{whipping}} out my revolver, I pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{came after}} me, snarling. I seized a stool and hurled <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He avoided it nimbly, {{and it went}} {{crashing}} through the half of the casement that was still closed.|$|E
60|$|He swung round, {{and five}} minutes later {{sat down on a}} truck on the tram‐ line. Harper leaned against <b>it,</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marquis de Baccarat, {{a highly}} {{polished}} villain. It is {{well enough to}} describe his character, as no one would think <b>it</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Murder! that is {{what the}} cheiromantist had seen there. Murder! The very night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear. The dark corners of the streets were full of <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> grinned <b>at</b> <b>him</b> from the roofs of the houses.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, Sam; and {{the same}} would hold good with you if it were Grace." [...] And then Tom dodged as Sam picked up a sofa pillow and threw, <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She stopped abruptly. She {{caught up}} her own chance {{question}} and pointed <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> a vitally important challenge. [...] "Will you let me come to your laboratory and work?" [...] she repeated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ask!' said Quilp, {{seizing the}} trifle of wood before {{mentioned}} and throwing <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with such dexterity {{that it was}} well the boy disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood. 'Ask, you dog.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He carries {{them about}} with him everywhere, ma'am." [...] (Has {{the one we}} bought {{yesterday}} with him now, though you might not think <b>it</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>him.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|He set {{his elbows}} on the table, and took his head in his hands. A groan escaped him. She heard <b>it,</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in her furtive way.|$|R
50|$|Kashet, Ari's dragon, {{is unique}} in that he is tame; he does not need tala to be docile. Ari raised him from infancy. Khefti-the-fat's one attempt to reclaim Vetch backfires, and Vetch's desire for revenge {{subsides}} somewhat. <b>It</b> chafes <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> however, that as an Altan serf he can never be freed.|$|R
6000|$|Just as Rupert {{leapt from}} his horse, the man holding the torch {{completed}} the loading of his pistol, and levelling <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> fired. The ball knocked {{off his hat}} just as he touched the ground, and the man shouted: ...|$|E
60|$|The love Leeby bore for Jamie {{was such}} that in their younger days it shamed him. Other laddies knew of it, and flung <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> until he dared Leeby to let on in public that he and she were related.|$|E
60|$|Now Rachel {{looked at}} the man angrily, playing with the little wand in her hand, whereon this induna shivered with terror, fearing lest she should point <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Rising, he came to Rachel and flung himself down before her.|$|E
60|$|The barkeeper looked sharply <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and <b>him,</b> {{then set}} out a bottle and a glass.|$|R
60|$|With {{my heart}} beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I {{rose out of}} my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of <b>it,</b> looking wildly <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Serve {{you right}} if I never picked you up till London-bridge,' he answered. 'Stand clear, Fulmort,' {{and with a}} run and a bound, he vaulted over the high hedge, and went {{crackling}} through the nodding bulrushes and reed-maces; while Lucy, having accomplished pulling {{up one of the}} latter, was pointing <b>it</b> lancewise <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> singing, ...|$|R
