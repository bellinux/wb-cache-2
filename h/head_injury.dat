5|$|Medieval and Renaissance {{surgeons}} {{continued the}} practice of trepanation for <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> In the Middle Ages, physicians further described <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> symptoms and the term concussion became more widespread. Concussion symptoms were first described systematically in the 16thcentury by Berengario da Carpi.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{pesticides}} {{and a history}} of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> have each been linked with Parkinson disease (PD), but the risks are modest. Never having smoked cigarettes, and never drinking caffeinated beverages, are also associated with small increases in risk of developing PD.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{identification}} of the so-called (fronto-) temporal lobe contusion is reviewed. Treatment of minor <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> actually starts with the right diagnosis. Injuries of the temporal lobe, characterized by a comparatively long period of post-traumatic amnesia should be distinguished from minor <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> (cerebral concussion). Treatment of minor <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> should include good information and explanation of the medical aspects of minor <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> to prevent the so called post-concussional syndrome, with long lasting sequelae. Changes of neurotransmitter metabolism in various kinds of <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> have been known for many years. Treatment with precursors of neurotransmitters (particularly physostigmine and L-DOPA) can be useful in unconsciousness and amnestic syndromes...|$|R

5|$|<b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> {{is present}} in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain {{to be the center of}} thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E
5|$|In the {{inertial}} effect, {{the lighter}} alveolar tissue is sheared from the heavier hilar structures, an effect similar to {{diffuse axonal injury}} in <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> It results {{from the fact that}} different tissues have different densities, and therefore different rates of acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|Seizures {{may also}} {{occur as a}} {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, <b>head</b> <b>injury,</b> toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
40|$|The short- and {{long-term}} neurologic impairment of children sustaining sports-related <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> has recently entered {{the forefront of}} medical literature, resulting in new guidelines on concussion management being provided to clinicians, coaches, and trainers. Yet, most parents have not been formally educated on <b>head</b> <b>injuries.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is to share the findings of a study conducted with 235 parents that identified their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of sports-related <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> in school-age students. The study found that 51 % of respondents were unaware that head trauma was more serious in children, 80 % were uninformed as to whether the school district had a policy on sports-related <b>head</b> <b>injuries,</b> 44 % did not know if there were medical guidelines for return to play, and 35 % did not know that repeated head trauma could cause dementia. Results of this research implore school nurses to improve patient and parental education when they care for and monitor students with <b>head</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Most are relative contraindications.|$|E

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study was conducted}} of the 880 children with <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> consecutively admitted to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa from July 1976 to June 1978. It confirmed a boy:girl ratio of about 2 : 1, with a peak of 3. 5 : 1 around 7 years of age. The largest number of <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> was in children under 1 year of age. Injuries were most common in summer and spring, and most were caused by falls. The most common place for <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> was in the home, but the single {{most common cause of}} injuries was bicycle accidents, which were responsible for 12 % of all the <b>head</b> <b>injuries.</b> Skull fractures were found in 30 % of all the patients. Of the 34 patients with severe <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> 8 (24 %) died, 9 (26 %) had a moderate residual disability and 17 (50 %) made a good recovery.

40|$|In 1974, {{work began}} on the first {{national}} survey of head and spinal cord injuries in the United States. The survey was a project of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke of the Public Health Service.

S. hospitals as inpatients between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 1974. To be medically eligible, patients must have experienced physical injury (except birth trauma) caused by an external, mechanical force. Probability sampling was used in a three-stage plan to select appropriate hospital records. Findings {{of the head and}} spinal cord injury survey follow: Of all age groups, 15 - to 24 -year-olds had the highest rate of <b>head</b> <b>injuries.</b> Males had a rate of <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> more than twice that of females. <b>Head</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred most often on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
