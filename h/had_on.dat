40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} has not econometrically, for countries with non-developed financial markets, estimated the impact domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality or the impact income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based {{on a very}} comprehensive panel data set, which includes 152 different countries, we econometrically estimate the impact changes in domestic credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality {{as well as the}} impact changes in income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account. Based on the econometric results in this paper, we are able to identify that the impact credit supply <b>has</b> <b>on</b> income inequality goes in opposite directions depending on if the financial market is developed or non-developed. Moreover, we were able to estimate the positive effects increased income inequality <b>has</b> <b>on</b> current account for countries with non-developed financial markets, a result previous research only has estimated theoretically...|$|R

Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position.
