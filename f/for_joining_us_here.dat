5000|$|Vice President-elect Pence, {{we welcome}} {{you and we}} truly thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> at Hamilton: An American Musical, we really do. We, sir,—we—are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new {{administration}} will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to {{work on behalf of}} all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations." ...|$|E

It would be just as well <b>for</b> you to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> now, as to go on to Seringapatam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I congratulate with England <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in the {{fellowship}} of slavery. It {{is not so}} terrible a thing as you imagine: we have long lived under it: and whenever you are disposed {{to know how to}} behave yourself in your new condition, you need go no further than me for a director. But, because we are resolved to go beyond you, we have transmitted a bill to England, to be returned here, giving the Government and six of the Council power for three years to imprison whom they please for three months, without any trial or examination: and I expect to be among the first of those upon whom this law will be executed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps some of {{the others}} may have got away, and may <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> today or tomorrow. If any are alive, they would be certain to come back here, when they thought the Malays had left." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Austrian armies, and the Russian too, [...] Will show {{nowhere in}} this. The thing that's done, [...] Be it a historied feat or nine days' fizz, [...] Will be done {{long before they}} <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] it said. [...] "Only one of Maqueda's {{ladies who}} had heard us and come to see who we were. When she learns I expect she will <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> as the girl says she's nervous and can't sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will wait}} {{a minute or two}} before I begin," [...] Hilda said. [...] "I have asked Dr. Leeds to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> He has been so very kind {{throughout}} the whole matter that we thought it was only fair that he should be here." ...|$|R
60|$|I must say, however, {{that the}} reason why this decree, or order, {{whichever}} it may be called, has been made, was to the end that men and women, who had large families of children, might be induced to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in Jamestown, {{as if we had}} not already mouths enough to feed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is a fine place, Sam," [...] answered Tom, [...] "and Nellie and I enjoy it {{just as much as}} Dick and Dora do." [...] Tom looked at his younger brother questioningly. [...] "I suppose now that you have graduated, Sam, you and Grace will be <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> some day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The band we saw {{must have}} been joined by another. There are {{certainly}} more than two thousand men there. They will undoubtedly carry the outer palisade. Many of our men will be killed, and many others {{will be unable to}} <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> I think that it will be much better to rely on this defence, alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We reached Mota (Sugar Loaf Island) in time {{to leave}} me for a night's visit to the people. I had time before the boat called next day at noon to see five or six of their villages. People quite {{accustomed}} to expect me--all most friendly, apparently pleased {{to be told that}} I would stop with them in the winter. Seven scholars <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here....</b>|$|R

40|$|Last Friday, 26 October, {{marked the}} end of Open Access Week 2012. This {{international}} event, which turned six this year, aims to inform researchers, academics and students about open access and inspire them to share not only this knowledge but also their research outputs. OpenUCT ran several successful events last week, (22 to 26 October) exploring open access and closely tied topics. For those of you who couldn't <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>here's</b> a brief recap of what went on...|$|R
5000|$|Another great {{version of}} the well {{documented}} [...] "The House Carpenter", which has travelled the Atlantic {{and can be found}} both in America and in Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. This particular version also echoes The Raggle Taggle Gypsy and Cuach Mo Lon Dubh Buí, where the exotic traveller entices a young wife away from her husband to her dismay. Julee Glaub Weem is the source for this unusual version, and she kindly <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> on backing vocals along with the great Tim O'Brien exchanging a verse and playing his mandolin.|$|R

The OBT starts on US 17/92 at the Polk County/Osceola County line a few miles south of Kissimmee. These names are used throughout Central Florida {{for the length of}} US 441 within the region.|$|R
50|$|Winchester {{was long}} the {{transportation}} {{hub of the}} lower Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Today, US 50 meets Interstate 81 there, as well as US 11, US 522, and State Route 7. <b>U.S.</b> Route 17 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 50 <b>here</b> from its national northern terminus as the route exits {{the city to the}} east and crosses the Shenandoah River.|$|R
40|$|The Act Out {{event is}} {{organized}} around the work of today’s Nordic women video artists, but in this essay I would like to propose a feminist approach {{to a number of}} video pieces by Portuguese women artists concerning issues related to gender, class and nationality, among other social-political themes, which they have in common with their Nordic counterparts <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today. There's not a long history of Portuguese video art or a Portuguese women's video art tradition related to feminist issues, like in Northern European countries. However, it's possible to trace features in contemporary Portuguese women video works to the third wave inclusive feminisms, namely the importance of women identities' multiplicity and difference and the complex interrelatedness between codings of gender, race, nationality, language, class, etc...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} waiter came to Mr. Dockwrath. [...] "What's this?" [...] said the attorney, {{taking up the}} bill and looking at it. The whole matter had been {{sufficiently}} explained to him, but nevertheless Mr. Moulder explained it again. [...] "In commercial rooms, sir, as no doubt you must be well aware, seeing that you have done us the honour of <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> the dinner bill is divided equally among all the gentlemen as sit down. It's {{the rule of the}} room, sir. You has what you like, and you calls for what you like, and conwiviality is thereby encouraged. The figure generally comes to five shillings, and you afterwards gives what you like to the waiter. That's about it, ain't it, James?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Weaver {{has done}} work with Disney {{in the late}} 1990s working {{alongside}} fellow Disney voice-overs Mark Elliot and Brian Cummings. One of his most notable Disney voice-overs is [...] "Thanks <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> this special preview. And now, our Feature Presentation!", a longer variation of [...] "And now, our Feature Presentation!", which is said {{at the start of}} most Disney films on videocassette on a [...] "Feature Presentation" [...] bumper.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{absurdity of}} the thing is, {{that we have an}} army in Sicily which might as well be at Jericho, for any use it is. If it <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>here,</b> it would make all the {{difference}} in the world; though certainly till the campaign opens it would have to be quartered at Lisbon, for it is as much as the wretched transport can do to feed us. Now the truth is, Portugal is a miserably poor country at the best of times, and does not produce enough for the wants of the people. Of course, it has been terribly impoverished by the war. The fields in most places have been untilled and, in fact, the greater portion of the population, as well as our army, has to be fed from England.|$|R

30|$|The guiding {{principle}} behind the organizational zoo series {{has been the}} belief that we can learn something about the general by studying the particular (Puranam and Håkonsson 2015). In that spirit, we took a deep dive approach {{to the case of}} GitHub and its transition from a boss-less into a more traditional hierarchy, hoping to illustrate the forces operating in all organizations that compel them to adopt certain organizational design solutions. We are very thankful to our panel of commentators <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> in this exercise and helping us to distil the lessons from this intriguing case.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, sir," [...] said Sir Henry Lee, whose {{feelings}} of hospitality, {{and of the}} fraternal reception due to a royalist sufferer, induced him to tolerate this intrusion more than {{he might have done}} otherwise. [...] "If you have fought or suffered for the King, sir, it is an excuse <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> and commanding our services in any thing in our power--although at present we are a family-party.--But I think I saw you in waiting upon Master Markham Everard, who calls himself Colonel Everard.--If your message is from him, you may wish to see me in private?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And in that," [...] said Bletson, {{smiling and}} bowing, [...] "the Lord-General {{has given us}} the most {{acceptable}} colleague {{that could have been}} added to our number. No doubt your authority <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> with <b>us</b> must be under warrant of the Council of State?" ...|$|R
60|$|Greatly to my relief, Sir Percival sent {{an apology}} <b>for</b> not <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> at breakfast. He {{had taken an}} early {{cup of coffee in}} his own room, and he was still engaged there in writing letters. At eleven o'clock, if that hour was convenient, he would do himself the honour of waiting on Miss Fairlie and Miss Halcombe.|$|R

And up next, a movie long thought to be lost before it was rediscovered and presented at last year's TCM Classic Film Festival. From Citation Films in nineteen sixty — Private Property. Oates and Corey Allen play a couple of sketchy drifters named Duke and Boots. They're hitchhiking their way across Southern California — for a threatening version of George and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. They spy an attractive woman driving a Corvette. Duke and Boots follow her home, take up residence in the vacant house next door, with the intention of spying on her and then seducing her.|$|R

60|$|It {{would be}} {{interesting}} to learn what place in the great Staatenbund or Bundes-staat would be given to possessions of the class of the West Indies, Mauritius, the West Coast, and such propugnacula of the Empire as Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, or Hong-Kong. What have we to offer Australia in return <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> in a share of such obligations as all these entail? Are her taxpayers anxious to contribute to their cost? Have her politicians either leisure or special competency for aiding in their administration? India, we must assume, would come within the province and jurisdiction of the Federation. It would hardly be either an advantage or a pleasure to the people of a young country, with all their busy tasks hot on their hands, to be interrupted by the duty of helping by men or cash to put down an Indian Mutiny, and even in quiet times to see their politicians attending to India instead of minding their own very sufficiently exacting business.|$|R

"Yet {{she failed}} to {{convince}} him with these arguments, and when she had given up all hope of winning him over to her own point of view, she went on, 'At least, then, nominate as emperor the roan who serves you with greatest loyalty and devotion.

50|$|About 1.5 mi into Sheldon, NY 98 {{passes the}} {{southern}} end of Tonawanda Creek, the source of which is located along the west side of NY 98. The route follows the water body along the Sheldon-Orangeville town line to a junction with US 20A just inside of the town of Orangeville. NY 98 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 20A <b>here,</b> following the latter northwestward to Varysburg, a small creekside hamlet in Sheldon. At the center of Varysburg, NY 98 leaves US 20A to follow Creek Road northward through the towns of Bennington and Attica, following the base of a large valley surrounding Tonawanda Creek. Due to the terrain of the area, the routing of NY 98 is fairly isolated from the remainder of the county until it reaches the outskirts of the village of Attica.|$|R

The conference provides a forum to introduce theoretical advances and to discuss practical experience, to learn about IE modelling and to explore the human dimensions of applying IE in corporate, public policy, and consumer decision making. The conference in Stockholm 2005 is a major event {{in the history of}} Industrial Ecology.

50|$|Past West Carthage, {{the route}} loosely follows the Black River across rolling {{farmland}} {{in the town}} of Champion to reach the hamlet of Great Bend, located across the Black River from the grounds of Fort Drum. Here, NY 26 meets NY 3 before crossing the river and entering Fort Drum. The route runs northwestward across the military reservation to the town of Le Ray, home to an intersection with US 11 just outside the Evans Mills village limits. NY 26 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 11 <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the second time, following the Indian River northeast across generally rural areas to reach the village of Philadelphia. The conjoined routes cross the river before splitting {{in the center of the}} community. At this point, NY 26 returns to a northwesterly alignment as it traverses rolling farmland for 6 mi to access the village of Theresa. Named Mill Street, the route crosses the Indian River again before changing names to Commercial Street and gradually curving to the southwest.|$|R
