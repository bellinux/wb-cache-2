In this study, we constructed a vector with a human interferon-a (hIFN-a) (without secretory signal sequence) gene cassette containing the immediate early promoter of human cytomegalovirus. Stably transfected bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> were obtained by G 418 selection, and hIFN-a transgenic embryos were produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Forty-six transgenic embryos were transplanted into surrogate cows, and five cows (10. 9 %) became pregnant. Two male cloned calves were born. Expression of hIFN-a was detected in transfected bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts,</b> transgenic SCNT embryos, and different tissues from a transgenic SCNT calf at two days old. In transfected bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts,</b> expression of intracellular IFN-a induced resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, increased apoptosis, and induced the expression of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase gene (PKR) and the 29 - 59 -oligoadenylate synthetase gene (29 - 59 OAS), which are IFN-inducible genes with antiviral activity.

Further insight into the underlying mechanisms of fetal wound healing may lead to new therapeutic approaches promoting adult scarless wound healing. Differences between fetal and adult wound healing {{are found in the}} extracellular matrix, the inflammatory reaction and the levels of growth factors present in the wound. This review focuses specifically on transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), as this growth factor is prominently involved in wound healing and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Although <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> do respond to TGF-β, they lack a proliferative and a contractile response and display short-lived myofibroblast differentiation, autocrine response, and collagen up-regulation in comparison with adult fibroblasts. Curiously, prolonged TGF-β activation is associated with fibrosis, and therefore, this short-lived response in <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> might contribute to scarless healing. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge on TGF-β signaling and the intracellular TGF-β signaling pathway in <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> Furthermore, this review also describes the various components that regulate the cellular TGF-β response and hypothesizes about the possible roles these components might play in the altered response of <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> to TGF-β. © 2013 by the Wound Healing Society...|$|R

40|$|Integumentary {{wounds in}} {{mammalian}} fetuses heal without scar; this scarless wound healing is intrinsic to fetal tissues and is notable for {{absence of the}} contraction seen in postnatal (adult) wounds. The precise molecular signals determining the scarless phenotype remain unclear. We have previously reported that the eta subunit of the chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide (CCT-eta) is specifically reduced in healing fetal wounds in a rabbit model. In this study, we examine the role of CCT-eta in fibroblast motility and contractility, properties essential to wound healing and scar formation. We demonstrate that CCT-eta (but not CCT-beta) is underexpressed in <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> compared to adult fibroblasts. An in vitro wound healing assay demonstrated that adult fibroblasts showed increased cell migration in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation, whereas <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> were unresponsive. Downregulation of CCT-eta in adult fibroblasts with short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) reduced cellular motility, both basal and growth factor-induced; in contrast, siRNA against CCT-beta had no such effect. Adult fibroblasts were more inherently contractile than <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> by cellular traction force microscopy; this contractility was increased by treatment with EGF and PDGF. CCT-eta siRNA inhibited the PDGF-induction of adult fibroblast contractility, whereas CCT-beta siRNA had no such effect. In each of these instances, the effect of downregulating CCT-eta was to modulate the behavior of adult fibroblasts so as to more closely approximate the characteristics of <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> We next examined the effect of CCT-et...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} dermal wound healing {{has long been}} used to {{elucidate}} the cellular and molecular processes guiding the connective tissue response to injury. Of particular interest are the mechanisms by which soluble mediators, including inflammatory signals, guide fibroblast activity within the wound bed. This thesis addresses the role of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in the regulation of fibroblast activities relevant to restoration of tissue structure and function. Although PGE 2 has been previously shown {{to play an important}} role in various wound healing steps, its precise contribution to the overall outcome of dermal repair is unclear. Using three well defined human dermal fibroblast phenotypes this study demonstrates that while PGE 2 signaling during dermal repair triggers pro-inflammatory cascades, its effects on fibroblast activities are putatively anti-fibrotic. Specifically, exogenous PGE 2 decreases the migratory and contractile potential of dermal fibroblasts through destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and inhibits endogenous collagen synthesis. While PGE 2 effects on fibroblast activity are largely conserved across phenotypes, <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> maintain a quantitatively diminished response to PGE 2 -induced alterations of cytoskeletal dynamics. Upon further analysis, this effect was shown to be representative of a larger intrinsic <b>fibroblast</b> phenotype. <b>Fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> were shown to maintain elevated rates of migration and contraction, as part of a generalized hyperactive dynamic state. Surprisingly, this phenotype was found to be sufficiently robust so as to persist despite changes in substrate and environmental constraints. In light of this finding, one additional approach was used to ascertain the robustness of the <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblast.</b> Transplantation of <b>fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> into an adult wound environment was used to assess whether the intrinsic <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblast</b> phenotype can survive the multitude of events comprising adult wound healing.

Fetal and adult tendon and dermal fibroblasts were isolated from pregnant sheep and rats and their fetuses and evaluated in monolayer and three-dimensional culture for migration, adhesion, growth, and extracellular matrix elaboration. <b>Fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> displayed serum-independent adhesion and growth, despite serum-dependent migration in monolayer culture. In addition, <b>fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> elaborated more type I collagen compared to adult dermal <b>fibroblasts.</b> Also, <b>fetal</b> tendon <b>fibroblasts</b> were shown to exhibit increased migration and collagen production compared to adult tendon fibroblasts in two-dimensional culture. Similar properties were found for three-dimensional analogs. Specifically, fetal tendon fibroblast-seeded constructs elaborated significantly more collagen compared to adult specimens; and <b>fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> displayed enhanced proliferation, total protein, and type I collagen production compared to adult dermal fibroblasts seeded on three-dimensional polymer scaffolds. Additionally, fetal dermal constructs exhibited increased mechanical properties when compared to adult samples. Taken together, these findings suggest that <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> are intrinsically different from adult <b>fibroblasts.</b> Furthermore, <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> possess properties (i. e., enhanced adhesion, growth, migration, and collagen production) that may give rise to the regenerative wound healing process observed in fetal skin and tendons.

The principle of the SCNT involves the reprogramming a somatic nucleus by injecting a somatic cell into a recipient oocyte whose nucleus has been removed. Therefore, the nucleus donor cells are considered as a crucial factor in SCNT. Cell cycle synchronization of nucleus donor cells at G 0 /G 1 stage can be induced by contact inhibition or serum starvation. In this study, acteoside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside compound, was investigated {{to determine whether it}} is applicable for inducing cell cycle synchronization, cytoprotection, and improving SCNT efficiency in canine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> Primary canine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> were treated with acteoside (10, 30, 50 μM) for various time periods (24, 48 and 72 hours). Cell cycle synchronization at G 0 /G 1 stage did not differ significantly with the method of induction: acteoside treatment, contact inhibition or serum starvation. However, of these three treatments, serum starvation resulted in significantly increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (99. 5 ± 0. 3 %) and apoptosis. The results also revealed that acteoside reduced ROS and apoptosis processes including necrosis in canine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts,</b> and improved the cell survival. Canine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> treated with acteoside were successfully arrested at the G 0 /G 1 stage.

We hypothesized delivery of <b>fetal</b> dermal <b>fibroblasts</b> would increase tissue organization and mechanical properties in comparison to adult dermal fibroblasts. However, at 1 and 8 weeks, the presence of dermal fibroblasts, either adult or fetal, had no significant effect on tissue histology or mechanical properties.

First, the effects of different types of donor cells, including <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> (FFs), adult fibroblasts (AFs), adult preadipocytes (APs), and adult blood mesenchymal (BM) cells, were investigated on the further in vitro and in vivo development. Compared to adult donor cells (AFs, APs, BM cells, respectively), FF cells resulted in a lower blastocyst/reconstructed embryo rate (30. 38 % vs. 37. 94 %, 34. 65 %, and 34. 87 %, respectively), but a higher overall efficiency on the number of piglets born alive per total blastocysts transferred (1. 50 % vs. 0. 86 %, 1. 03 %, and 0. 91 %, respectively) and a lower rate of developmental abnormalities (10. 87 % vs. 56. 57 %, 24. 39 %, and 51. 85 %, respectively). Second, recloning was performed with cloned adult fibroblasts (CAFs) and cloned <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> (CFFs).

These observations may provide a mechanism of action of anti-oestrogens that is independent of the presence of oestrogen receptor in the tumour epithelial cells, and thus provide an explantation for the counter-intuitive results of adjuvant anti-oestrogen action...|$|R

To clone pigs from differentiated cells, we microinjected the nuclei of porcine (Sus scrofa) <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> into enucleated oocytes, and development was induced by electroactivation. The transfer of 110 cloned embryos to four surrogate mothers produced an apparently normal female piglet. The clonal provenance of the piglet was indicated by her coat color and confirmed by DNA microsatellite analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} somatic nuclear {{transfer}} critically {{depends on the}} cell cycle stage of the donor nucleus and the recipient cytoplast. In this study we tested serum deprivation {{as well as two}} reversible cell cycle inhibitors, aphidicolin and butyrolactone I, for their ability to synchronize porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> at either G 0 stage or G 1 /S or G 2 /M transition. The synchronization efficiency of the various protocols was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), cell proliferation assays, and semiquantitative multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection of the cell cycle-regulated porcine Polo-like kinase mRNA (Plk-p). FACS measurements revealed that 66. 6 - 73. 3 % of the porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> were in G 0 /G 1 stage (2 C DNA content) in serum-supplemented medium. Short periods of 24 - 72 h of serum deprivation significantly increased the proportion of cells at G 0 /G 1 phase to 77. 9 - 80. 2 %, and mitotic activity had already terminated after 48 h. Prolonged culture in serum-deprived medium induced massive DNA fragmentation. Aphidicolin treatment led to an accumulation of 81. 9 +/- 4. 9 % of cells at the G 1 /S transition. Butyrolactone I arrested 81. 0 +/- 5. 8 % of the cells at the end of G 1 stage and 37. 0 +/- 6. 8 % at the G 2 /M transition. The effects of both chemical inhibitors were fully reversible, and their removal led to a rapid progression in the cell cycle. The measurement of Plk-p expression allowed discrimination between the presumptive G 0 phase induced by serum deprivation and the G 1 /S transition arrest achieved by chemical inhibitors. These data indicate that porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> can be effectively synchronized at various cell cycle stages without compromising their proliferation capacity...|$|R
40|$|A 70,XXX, + 18 {{karyotype}} {{was found}} by chorionic villus sampling, while the <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblast</b> culture of the affected fetus revealed a 47,XX, + 18 karyotype. From several possible mechanisms, we assume that a second gamete fusion occurred after the first cell division of the zygote. According to this interpretation, the mosaicism arose in very early pregnancy (at the two-cell stage). This discrepancy can therefore be explained by selection pressure, due to the differentiation processes in the embryonic tissues...|$|R
40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) -BB-stimulated {{glycosaminoglycan}} (GAG) synthesis/secretion in <b>fetal</b> lung <b>fibroblasts</b> {{is dependent upon}} sequential activation of the PDGF β-receptor, phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI- 3 K), the serine/threonine kinase Akt- 1, 2 and the GTPase Rab 3 D. Since the Akt pathway has been implicated in cell survival mechanisms, we investigated whether the pathway regulating GAG synthesis/secretion was anti-apoptotic. PDGF-BB treatment protected <b>fetal</b> lung <b>fibroblasts</b> against serumstarvation-induced apoptosis while wortmannin, an inhibitor of of PI- 3 K, abrogated this protective effect. Transfection of constitutively-active Akt into <b>fetal</b> lung <b>fibroblasts</b> also safe-guarded the cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation. In order {{to determine whether the}} anti-apoptotic response was due, at least in part, to GAGs, we treated lung fibroblasts with β-D-xyloside as well as with topically-applied GAGs, specifically those produced by <b>fetal</b> lug <b>fibroblasts.</b> β-D-xyloside increased GAG synthesis/secretion and diminished apoptosis. Application of sulfated GAGs, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, but not non-sulfated hyaluronan, also resulted in diminished apoptosis. Moreover, topically-applied sulfated GAGs increased BAD phosphorylation and diminished caspase 3 and 7 cleavage, indicating an anti-apototic response. These data are compatible with the PDGF-BB-GAG signaling pathway regulating programmed fibroblast death in the fetal lung. Glycosaminoglycans abrograte apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of collagen gene expression in normal diploid human <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> (KMS- 6 cells), and fibroblasts immortally transformed by treatment of KMS- 6 with Co- 60 gamma rays (KMST- 6 cells) {{was compared to}} that of ones tumorigenically transformed by treatment of KMST- 6 cells with Harvey murine sarcoma virus (KMST- 6 -Ras cells). Synthesized collagenous protein decreased to approximately 30 % of that of normal <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> in both transformed cell lines, and the relative rate of collagen synthesis to total protein synthesis decreased about sixfold in KMST- 6 cells and twelvefold in KMST- 6 -Ras cells. The m-RNA levels of type I collagen in both of these cell lines decreased to approximately 20 % of that of the control fibroblasts, whereas type III collagen m-RNA levels decreased to only 9 % of that of the control. The copy number of the collagen gene in both transformed cell lines was unaltered. The transcriptional rates of collagen α 1 (I) and collagen α 1 (Ill) in both cell lines decreased to 20 % and 7 % respectively of that of control. These data indicate that collagen synthesis was reduced at the transcriptional level in these transformed human fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the in vitro and in vivo development of bovine nuclear-transferred embryos. A bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblast</b> culture was established and used as nucleus donor. Slaughterhouse oocytes were matured in vitro for 18 h before enucleation. Enucleated oocytes were fused with <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> with an electric stimulus and treated with cytochalasin D and cycloheximide for 1 h followed by cycloheximide alone for 4 h. Reconstructed embryos were cultured for 7 - 9 days and those which developed to blastocysts were transferred to recipient cows. Of 191 enucleated oocytes, 83 (43. 5 %) were successfully fused and 24 (28. 9 %) developed to blastocysts. Eighteen freshly cloned blastocysts were transferred to 14 recipients, 5 (27. 8 %) of which were pregnant on day 35 and 3 (16. 7 %) on day 90. Of the three cows that reached the third trimester, one recipient died of hydrallantois 2 months before term, one aborted fetus was recovered at 8 months of gestation, and one delivered by cesarian section a healthy cloned calf. Today, the cloned calf is 15 months old and presents normal body development (378 kg) and sexual behavior (libido and semen characteristics) ...|$|R
40|$|Scarless {{healing of}} {{cutaneous}} wounds occurs in humans {{during the first}} two trimesters of development, but by birth all wounds are repaired with scar formation. To search for transcriptional regulatory genes that might mediate fetal tissue regeneration, we surveyed homeobox gene expression in proliferating <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> and in wounded and unwounded skin. Two novel human homeobox genes, PRX- 2 and HOXB 13, were identified that were differentially expressed during fetal versus adult wound healing. Both genes were predominantly expressed in proliferating <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> and developing dermis, and PRX- 2 was downregulated in adult skin. In a model of scarless fetal skin regeneration, PRX- 2 expression was strongly increased compared with unwounded skin and the signal was localized to the wounded dermis, the site of scarless repair. Conversely, in adult skin weak epidermal PRX- 2 expression was observed, mRNA levels were not increased by wounding, and no dermal expression was detected. HOXB 13 expression was decreased in wounded fetal tissue relative to unwounded fetal controls or wounded adult skin. Thus both HOXB 13 and PRX- 2 are expressed in patterns consistent with roles in fetal skin development and cutaneous regeneration...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{data on the}} {{importance}} of the adherence phenomenon of platelets to lymphocytes. In the present study rosette formation and agglutination of lymphocytes with autologous platelets were observed in children after surgery. Lymphocytes and platelets were separated by 'Lymphoprep' solutions from heparinized blood. Platelet-lymphocyte agglutinates were prepared in the presence of <b>inactivated</b> <b>fetal</b> calf serum and were counted on slides. Platelet-lymphocyte agglutinates were found to be significantly elevated during the first post-operative day. It is concluded that the enhancement of platelet adhesiveness to lymphocytes may be due to anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Histone H 3 lysine 36 (H 3 K 36) {{methylation}} {{is known}} to be associated with transcriptionally active genes, and is considered a genomic marker of active loci. To investigate the changes in H 3 K 36 methylation in pig, we determined the mono-, di-, and tri-methylations of H 3 K 36 (H 3 K 36 me 1, H 3 K 36 me 2 and H 3 K 36 me 3, respectively) in porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts,</b> oocytes and preimplantation embryos by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies and confocal microscopy. These analyses revealed that only H 3 K 36 me 3 in porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> consistently colocalized with transcription sites identified as actively synthesizing RNA based on fluorouridine (FU) incorporation. Treatment of cells with flavopiridol, which blocks transcription elongation, completely abrogated both H 3 K 36 me 3 signals and RNA synthesis. All three types of H 3 K 36 methylation were present and did not significantly differ during oocyte maturation. In parthenogenetic embryos, H 3 K 36 me 1 and -me 2 were detected in 1 -cell through blastocyst-stage embryos. In contrast, H 3 K 36 me 3 was not detected in most 1 -cell stage embryos. H 3 K 36 me 3 signals became detectable in 2 -cell stage embryos, peaked at the 4 -cell stage, decreased at the 8 -cell stage, and then became undetectable at blastocyst stages in both parthenogenetic and in vitro-fertilized (IVF) embryos. Unlike the case in IVF embryos, H 3 K 36 me 3 could not be demethylated completely during the 1 -cell stage in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. These results collectively indicate that H 3 K 36 me 3, but not H 3 K 36 me 1 or -me 2, is associated with transcription elongation in porcine <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts.</b> H 3 K 36 me 3 is developmentally regulated and may be a histone mark of embryonic gene activation in pig. Aberrant H 3 K 36 tri-methylation occurred during the nuclear reprogramming of SCNT embryos...|$|R
50|$|The DNA-associated protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the paired family of {{homeobox}} proteins. Expression is localized to proliferating <b>fetal</b> <b>fibroblasts</b> and the developing dermal layer, with downregulated expression in adult skin. Increases in expression of this gene during fetal but not adult wound healing suggest a possible role in mechanisms that control mammalian dermal regeneration and prevent formation of scar response to wounding. The expression patterns provide evidence consistent with a role in fetal skin development and a possible role in cellular proliferation.|$|R
