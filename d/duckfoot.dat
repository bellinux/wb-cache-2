In this configuration, submersible sewage pumps with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the wet well itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical guide rails and seal onto a permanently fixed [...] "duckfoot", which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the <b>duckfoot</b> and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the <b>duckfoot</b> where {{the weight of the}} pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.|$|E

The Bergers needed capital to improve the campus and to free them of 24/7/365 responsibility. They learned of the Foundation for Illinois Archaeology and its fledgling program at Kampsville, Illinois. A young and dynamic man, Clark Hinsdale, was building an educational component.

By 1983, negations resulted in a merger of the two non-profit corporations note that Non-profit corporations are not bought and sold. FIA then {{changed its name to}} The Center for American Archaeology (at Northwestern University). CAA paid off I-SEP’s debts and Bergers donated 70 acres of land. A new lodge designed to house 40 students was built. A lab building was provided. Additional research archaeologists were hired, and Bergers identified two major sites for research: Sand Canyon Pueblo, and the <b>Duckfoot</b> Site. Southwest archaeologists coordinated the research design and standards, academic supervision, and selection of staff archaeologists.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{for control}} of couch grass (Elymus repens L.) with reduced tillage and cover crops to achieve low risk of {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) leaching were investigated. Treatments with reduced post-harvest tillage (one or two passes with <b>duckfoot</b> cultivator), hoeing between rows in combination with a cover crop, and a cover crop mown twice during autumn were compared with treatments with conventional disc cultivation and the control without tillage or cover crop. The study was conducted on a sandy soil in Sweden with measurements of N and P leaching. A 2 -year experimental protocol was used, repeated twice. Treatments were implemented in the first year, and effects on couch grass (shoot density, shoot and rhizome biomass) were measured during autumn {{and in the second}} year. Significant effects of a single <b>duckfoot</b> cultivation and cover crop strategies were observed on couch grass shoot density in autumn but persistent effects were not verified. In conclusion, a single cultivation after harvest instead of repeated reduced the risk of N leaching and a cover crop in combination with hoeing or mowing effectively reduced it. Repeated cultivations resulted in mean annual N leaching of 26 kg N ha(- 1) compared with 20 kg in the treatment with one cultivation, 17 kg in the control, 16 and 12 kg in cover crop treatments with mowing and hoeing, respectively.

40|$|Intensively {{cultivated}} {{areas in}} {{the upper part of}} the Guadalentin catchment (southeast Spain) show a systematic spatial pattern of surface rock fragment cover (R(c)). The objective of this paper is to quantify and to explain this spatial rock fragment cover pattern. Therefore, a map of an intensively cultivated area of 5 km(2) was digitised, and for each pixel total topographic curvature was calculated. Next, rock fragment cover was determined photographically at 35 sites with a range of total slope curvatures. A linear relation between total curvature and rock fragment cover was found, except for narrow concavities. It was hypothesised that this pattern can be explained by a significant net downslope movement of rock fragments and fine earth by tillage. The displacement distances of rock fragments by tillage with a <b>duckfoot</b> chisel were measured by monitoring the displacement of tracers (painted rock fragments and aluminium cubes) on 5 sites having different slopes. The rate of tillage erosion for one tillage pass with a <b>duckfoot</b> chisel, expressed by the diffusion constant (k), equals 282 kg/m for up and downslope tillage and only 139 kg/m for contour tillage. Nomograms indicate that mean denudation rates in almond groves due to tillage erosion (3 to 5 tillage passes per year) can easily amount to 1. 5 - 2. 6 mm/year for contour tillage and up to 3. 6 - 5. 9 mm/year for up- and downslope tillage for a field, 50 m long and having a slope of 20 %. These figures are at least one order of magnitude larger than reported denudation rates caused by water erosion in similar environments. Hence tillage erosion contributes significantly to land degradation. The downslope soil flux induced by tillage not only causes considerable denudation on topographic convexities (hill tops and spurs) and upper field boundaries but also an important sediment accumulation in topographic concavities (hollows and valley bottoms) and at lower field boundaries. Kinetic sieving (i. e. the upward migration of rock fragments) by the tines of the <b>duckfoot</b> chisel also concentrates the largest rock fragments in the topsoil in such a way that a rock fragment mulch develops in narrow valleys and at the foot of the slopes. These results clearly indicate that tillage erosion is the main process responsible for the observed rock fragment cover pattern in the study area, Since the study area is representative for many parts of southern Spain where almond groves have expanded since 1970, the results have a wider application. They show to what extent intensive tillage of steep slopes has contributed to the increase in soil degradation, to changes in hillslope morphology (i. e. strong denudation of convexities, development of lynchets and rapid infilling of narrow valley bottoms) and to the development of rock fragment cover patterns which control the spatial variability of the hydrological and water erosion response within such landscapes. status: publishe...|$|E

In the four environments with high weed pressure, the weed ground cover was already higher at pod filling in the harrowing variant.

40|$|Tillage erosion is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as an important}} soil erosion process on agricultural land. In view of its potential significance, {{there is a clear}} need to broaden the experimental database far the magnitude of tillage erosion to include a range of tillage implements and agricultural environments. The study discussed in this paper sought to address the need for such data by examining tillage erosion by a <b>duckfoot</b> chisel plough in stony soils on steep slopes in a semi-arid environment. Results of the investigation of coarse fraction (rock fragment) translocation by tillage in this environment have been presented elsewhere and the paper focuses on tillage translocation and erosion of the fine earth. Tillage translocation was measured at 10 sites, representing both upslope and downslope tillage by a <b>duckfoot</b> chisel plough on five different slopes, with tangents ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 41. A fine-earth tracer, comprising fine earth labelled with Cs- 134, was introduced into the plough layer before tillage. After a single pass of the plough, incremental samples of plough soil were excavated and sieved to separate the fine earth from the rock fragments,Translocation of the fine-earth tracer was established by analysing the 134 Cs content of the samples of fine earth. These data were used to establish translocation distances for each combination of slope and tillage direction. Translocation distances of the fine earth were not significantly different from translocation distances of the coarse fraction. For all sites, except uphill on the 0. 41 slope, translocation distances were found to be linearly related to slope tangent. The soil flux due to tillage for each site was calculated using the translocation distance and the mass per unit area of the plough layer. For slopes with tangents < 0. 25, the relationship between soil flux and tangent was linear and the soil flux coefficient derived was 520 - 660 kg m(- 1) per pass. This is much larger than the coefficients found in other studies and this high magnitude is attributed to the non-cohesive nature and high rock fragment content of the soil in this investigation. A second contrast with previous studies was found in non-linearity in the relationship between soil flux and tangent when steeper slopes were included. This was a product of variation in plough depth between the steepest slopes and the remainder of the study area. On the basis of the study it is suggested that an improved understanding of tillage erosion may be obtained by considering the dual processes of tillage detachment (mass per unit area of soil subject to tillage) and tillage displacement (equivalent to translocation distance per pass) in assessing, comparing and modelling tillage translocation. An improved model is proposed that recognises the complexity of soil redistribution by tillage, provides a framework for process-based investigation of the controls on tillage fluxes, and allows identification of potential self-limiting conditions for tillage erosion.

40|$|The lateral 2 ̆ 2 corners 2 ̆ 2 where Kamb and Whillans Ice Streams (KIS and WIS) {{discharge}} into the Ross Ice Shelf share common geometries and ice mechanical settings. At both {{corners of the}} now-stagnant KIS outlet, shear margins of apparently different ages confine regions with a relatively flat, smooth surface expression. These features are called the 2 ̆ 2 <b>Duckfoot</b> 2 ̆ 2 on the northern, right-lateral side and the 2 ̆ 2 Goosefoot 2 ̆ 2 on the other. It has been suggested, on evidence found in ice internal layers, that the flat ice terrains on KIS were afloat in the recent past, {{at a time when}} the ice stream grounding line was upstream of its present location. The overdeepening in the bed just upstream of the KIS grounding line supports this view of the past geometry. The right-lateral margin at the outlet of the currently active WIS, the location of Subglacial Lake Englehardt (SLE), appears to have many similarities with the right lateral margin of KIS, though with a less developed looking inboard margin. This paper presents a mechanical analysis using surface and bed topography and velocity datasets comparing the <b>Duckfoot</b> flat ice terrain with the terrain around Subglacial Lake Englehardt. At both locations mechanical thinning along shear margins and lows in the bed topography redirects basal water routing towards the features. Here, I consider the history of these features and their role in ice stream variability by comparison of the relict and modern features and via numerical modeling of ice shelf grounding and ungrounding in response to variations in ice flow. We propose two scenarios for the development of flat ice terrains/subglacial lakes at the outlets of ice streams. In the first, development of a lake in the hydraulic potential low along a shear margin forces a margin jump as shearing develops along the inboard shore of the margin lake. This thesis presents evidence for an inboard (relative to the main outboard shear margin) zone of shear along the inboard shoreline of SLE, suggesting that subglacial lakes along shear margins are capable of facilitating shear margin jumps. In the second, grounding line advance around a relative low in the bed, creating adjacent margins along the lakeshores, forms a remnant lake. Discerning which of these scenarios is appropriate at the KIS outlet has implications for understanding the history of the ice stream grounding line. An ice flow model is used to place these local conditions in a regional context by studying the effect of internal perturbations, such as ice rise stagnation or inward margin jumps, on grounding line position. Bathymetry is important in determining ice stream flow in the ways that might not be otherwise realized in 1 -D flow model studies. In the numerical modeling experiments, grounding line advance across the KIS outlet is mediated by the overdeepening in the bed and proceeds not in the direction of ice flow but transverse to flow. This finding adds complexity to both a flowline view of grounding line migration and the theory that grounding lines are unstable in the presence of inward sloping bed topography...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{processing}} {{in plant}} production {{is a very}} impor-tant factor influencing the yield of a harvest. Also soil processing, not done {{in the right way}} and on time, re-duces the stability of yields and soil fertility. The main factor in soil processing is the clearing away of weeds, parasites and other diseases. Crucial also is the influ-ence of soil processing in the economical use of soil moisture. When producing huge amounts of crops, inap-propriate rainfall could have the main impact on yields. That is why we focus on the best results in reducing costs, lowering fuel consumption, time, working forces and soil consolidation. ANKEN et al. (1993) explain the requirements for studying the function of modern culti-vators. Similar conclusions were drawn by JÄGER and FUNK (1994). HŮLA and MAYER (1995) came to the same conclusions. They also examined in detail the fac-tors that influence the resistance of the working elements of the shovel cultivator. It is very important to know the exact weight and direction of forces over time Fx and Fz = f(t), because of finding out the impact of each factor on the need for energy during soil processing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Either the working parts of weeders or whole working sections have to be connected with a frame in order to follow the field’s surface independently and to achieve a constant depth of soil processing.

40|$|When {{a mixture}} of dry {{particles}} with different diameters is disturbed, a segregation will occur with the finest particles moving downwards and the largest particles moving upwards. The objective {{of this paper was}} to determine whether this principle could be used to explain the high stoniness of topsoils of cultivated fields in the Mediterranean. A dense cover of rock fragments reduces soil erosion and promotes infiltration and hence, maintaining a coarse top layer may be an important management practice in areas threatened by desertification. Field experiments were conducted to determine the change in vertical rock-fragment size distribution after a certain number of tillage passes, until steady state (no more change) was reached. Soil pits were prepared and filled with four layers of rock fragments. Each 4 -cm-thick layer contained a known distribution of rock-fragment sizes. One series of pits contained the coarsest layer initially at the bottom and the finest on top, while a second series showed an even distribution of coarse and fine particles throughout the profile. The pits were subjected to different tillage frequencies (max. of eight passes, all to a depth of 16 cm) by a caterpillar tractor pulling a chisel with a <b>duckfoot.</b> After the tillage operations, rock-fragment content (by mass) of each layer was determined by sieving and weighing, and rock-fragment cover (percentage) at the soil surface was assessed by photographical interpretation respectively. The experiments, conducted under dry conditions, demonstrated that there was a strong tendency for the coarsest fraction to accumulate in the top layers and for the finest fraction to accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} tilled layers. After two events, the coarsest fraction was already the dominant fraction in the surface layer for the first series of experiments (coarsest rock fragments initially at bottom). For the second series (equal distribution of rock-fragment sizes with depth), this already occurred after one event. The photographical interpretation of the surface rock fragment cover showed initially a rapid increase of intermediate sized fragments (0. 6 - 5. 0 cm) during the first series of experiments. After five tillage passes, the coarsest rock fragments were dominant at the surface. The rapid grading due to tillage observed in these experiments may explain the high rock fragment content of the topsoil in many cultivated shallow soils in the Mediterranean area. These results also suggest that in soils in which rock fragments on the surface are known to improve soil and water conservation, these benefits may be obtained after only one or two tined tillage operations in dry soil.

40|$|The Ekoodlaren (Eco cropper) {{is a new}} {{implement}} {{constructed to}} prepare the seedbed, to seed, to fertilize and to row weed in single or combined operations. The main purposes for the construction is to save time and money, and to reduce excessive packing of the soil. Its drilling and row hoeing qualities were examined at the Department of Soil Sciences in three series of field trials during 1991. Two of the series, 'Seed coulters: Different tillage methods' (Rl- 5015) and 'Seed coulters: Minimized tillage' (R 2 - 5016), were carried out on the Ultuna property. The third (R 2 -S 017), concerning row hoeing in small grains, {{was carried out in}} the county of Östergötland. In R 2 - 5015, the use of Ekoodlaren and three other drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations. The seedbed treatments were seeding after mouldboard plowing and harrowing, stubble cultivation and harrowing and direct drilling. In R 2 -S 016, three different drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations (zero, one and three harrowings) in both autumn ploughed and shallow cultivated plots. In R 2 - 5017, the work of Ekoodlaren was compared with a drill equipped with hoe coulters in one treatment. The other treatments concerned row hoeing and fertilizing with Ekoodlaren. The shape of the frame of the Ekoodlaren is a T. The seed box emanates from a Tive air drill. The load carrying wheels are mounted on bogies, where the working depth regulation mechanism and the coulters (<b>duckfoot</b> shovels) are also mounted. The placement of the seeds was carried out nearly as well by the Ekoodlaren as by the reference machines equipped with hoe coulters. Then number of emerged plants was slightly higher than for the reference drill in the row weeding trials. The stands of wintering weeds and volunteer plants were strongly decreased by the drill operation of the Ekoodlaren. The effect on annual weeds depended upon the conditions during the seeding operation. Rainy weather delayed the row weeding to a time when the crop was too developed for normal weeding operations in practical farming. Row weeding small grains did decrease the weed stand. The shovels did not remove any grain plants, but weeding did decrease the yield compared to the unworked Ekoodlaren treatment. The abnormal weather conditions (unusually wet) prevented any attempts to interpret the results for a more normal year. No notable yield differences occurred in the Ultuna trials, while in the row weeding trials, seeding with Ekoodlaren gave a higher yield in all treatments. In the Ultuna trials, the overall variances were small. This was not the case in the Östergötland trials due to a considerable weed stand (developed during previous cropping seasons) and unusually wet weather conditions. Results of other research, partly with the Ekoodlaren, concerning fuel consumption and required time for field work have shown slightly lower costs compared to conventional tillage methods and clear possibilities of saving time and fuel...|$|E
