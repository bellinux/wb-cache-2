40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} {{and application of}} a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor for neutron detection is described. The sensor provides images of neutron-induced single-event effects (SEEs) at 9 µm pixel resolution and a charge/pixel resolution of typically 36. 6 electronic charges. Example results are presented, showing the charge profiles resulting from single events observed during tests in a representative neutron spectrum. The sensor enables aspects of SEE phenomena to be studied directly in more detail than hitherto. 1. Single event effects in electronics Interactions between semiconductor electronic devices and energetic subatomic particles, such as neutrons, can adversely affect device performance in several ways. In particular, interaction with individual particles can disrupt the function of a device through spurious charge generation, sometimes also leading to permanent failure through a range of indirect mechanisms including latch-up. These effects are termed “single event ” effects (SEEs) as each results stochastically from a single interaction between a device and an <b>ionising</b> <b>particle,</b> rather than occurring as {{the cumulative effect of}} many interactions [1]. Neutrons, although not <b>directly</b> <b>ionising,</b> induce SEEs through nuclear interactions with constituent ions of the semiconductor lattice...|$|R

50|$|In {{the federal}} {{election}} of 18 May 2003, one candidate received 4,096 unexplained extra votes. After an inquiry the anomaly was attributed to a single event upset in an electronic voting machine, presumably caused by an <b>ionising</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} drastically limited both {{range and}} flight duration, but was used because of fears that <b>ionised</b> <b>particles</b> in the hot, rocket motor exhaust stream {{would interfere with}} the guidance radar signals; further development showed the fears were unfounded.|$|R
40|$|Inelastic nuclear {{interactions}} in silicon sensors can produce highly <b>ionising</b> <b>particles</b> {{and result in}} signals equivalent of up to ~ 1000 minimum <b>ionising</b> <b>particles.</b> These rare events have been observed to cause measurable deadtime in all 128 channels of the CMS Tracker APV 25 front-end readout chip. Analysis of beam test data, laboratory measurements and simulation studies have provided measurements of both {{the rate at which}} non-negligible deadtime occurs and the most probable deadtime resulting from a highly ionising event. Laboratory measurements also predict that through a suitable choice of a front-end hybrid resistor, the deadtime may be reduced. The inefficiency due to highly ionising events is predicted to be at the sub-percent level in CMS...|$|R

40|$|A novel Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) for charged {{particle}} tracking is presented. The partially depleted thin epitaxial layer of a low-resistivity silicon wafer {{is used as}} a sensitive detector volume from which the charge liberated by <b>ionising</b> <b>particles</b> is collected by diffusion. The sensor is a photodiode within a special structure allowing the high detection efficiency required for tracking applications. Two prototypes have been designed and fabricated using standard 0. 6 and 0. 35 micron CMOS processes. Results of the first prototype are presented, which is made of four arrays, each containing 6464 pixels with a readout pitch of 20 microns in both directions. Extensive tests made with a soft X-ray source (Fe) and beams of minimum <b>ionising</b> <b>particles</b> (pions of 15 and 120 GeV/c) at CERN have demonstrated the predicted performance. The individual pixel noise of around 12 ENC leads to an extremely favourable signal to noise ratio for minimum <b>ionising</b> <b>particles</b> for which over 1000 electrons can be collected {{at the peak of the}} Landau distribution. The new circuit in the 0. 35 -micron process on a thinner epitaxial layer seems to have similar good performance. These new devices are extremely promising for future high precision vertex detectors as they provide solutions with a very low material budget and with high resolution at relatively low cost due to their fabrication in a standard submicron CMOS technology...|$|R

5000|$|The first Townsend {{coefficient}} ( [...] α [...] ), {{also known}} as first Townsend avalanche coefficient is a term used where secondary ionisation occurs because the primary ionisation electrons gain sufficient energy from the accelerating electric field, or from the original <b>ionising</b> <b>particle.</b> The coefficient gives the number of secondary electrons produced by primary electron per unit path length.|$|R
40|$|Inelastic nuclear {{collisions}} of hadrons {{incident on}} silicon sensors can generate secondary highly <b>ionising</b> <b>particles</b> (HIPs) and deposit {{as much energy}} within the sensor bulk as several hundred minimum <b>ionising</b> <b>particles.</b> The large signals generated by these &# 8216;HIP events&# 8217; can momentarily saturate the APV 25 front-end readout chip for the silicon strip tracker (SST) sub-detector of the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment, resulting in deadtime in the detector readout system. This paper presents studies of this phenomenon through simulation, laboratory measurements and dedicated beam tests. A proposed change to a front-end component to reduce the APV 25 sensitivity to HIP events is also examined. The results are used to infer the expected effect {{on the performance of}} the CMS SST at the future large hadron collider. The induced inefficiencies are at the percent level and will have a negligible effect on the physics performance of the SST...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{results of test}} beams obtained for pions with energies between 2 and 10 GeV which interact in {{the volume of the}} highly granular CALICE Silicon-Tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter prototype (SiW ECAL). An algorithm optimised to ﬁnd interactions in the SiW ECAL at small hadron energies is developed. This allows identifying the interaction point in the calorimeter at an efficiency between 62 % and 83 % depending on the energy of the primary particle. The unprecedented granularity of the SiW ECAL allows for the distinction between different interaction types. This in turn permits more detailed examinations of hadronic models than was possible with traditional calorimeters. So far, it is possible to disentangle minimum <b>ionising</b> <b>particle</b> (MIP) events, elastic π-nucleus scattering and spallation reactions which lead to the start of a internuclear cascade or which result in a small number of highly <b>ionising</b> <b>particles.</b> Various observables are compared with predictions from hadronic physics lists as contained in the simulation toolkit geant 4...|$|R
