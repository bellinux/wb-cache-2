25|$|VISTA was {{conceived}} and {{developed by a}} consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by Queen Mary, University of London, and it became an <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> to ESO {{as part of the}} UK's ratification agreement. The telescope's design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council's UK Astronomy Technology Centre (STFC, UK ATC). Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at the December 2009 ceremony at ESO headquarters in Garching, which was attended by representatives of Queen Mary, University of London and STFC. Since then the telescope has been operated by ESO, capturing quality images since it began operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} attract greater {{research}} funds is needed to meet {{the goals of the}} plan, and the university has set a goal of $100million annually. Fourteen years later, in FY2013, research expenditures reached this goal. To help raise money the university mounted a $1billion capital campaign, of which the public phase began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008. In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S.university at the time. The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15million. By September 2006, the $1billion goal has been exceeded much in part to an <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> of software commercially valued at $513.95million by the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). In light of this, the board of trustees increased the goal of the $1billion capital campaign to $1.4billion by June 30, 2009. The new goal was met by October 1, 2008.|$|E

The order stated that a civil penalty in the amount of three times the amount of money spent on the mailer would be imposed on Campaign to Re-Elect Joe Arpaio 2012.

50|$|Three taxicab {{services}} {{exist in}} Salt Lake City: Ute Cab, City Cab, and Yellow Cab. In 2004, a controversy sprung up between entrepreneurs wishing {{to enter the}} taxi market in the city, and the mayor's office, which has maintained tight restrictions on the taxi fleet. The controversy was fueled by Yellow Cab's advocacy of Mayor Rocky Anderson's re-election campaign by displaying the mayor's campaign ads wrapped around the company's taxis, and further by {{the decision by the}} mayor's campaign not to report this as a political <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution.</b> Anderson drove a cab for Yellow Cab while in college.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or <b>in-kind</b> <b>contributions.</b> Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that <b>in-kind</b> <b>contributions</b> be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|R

50|$|UNHCR Cyprus {{would like}} to see more lawyers {{providing}} high quality counselling to asylum applicants, either through free legal counselling (as an <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution)</b> by registered lawyers or through further development of NGO capacity. It will also pursue more projects to enhance the understanding of the refugee problem among the Cypriot society. Misinformation in the country of asylum will only exacerbate the suffering of refugees, who have already experienced enough pain after having lost their homes and loved ones as a result of who they are or what they believe. UNHCR representation in Cyprus has in addition a mandate to mobilize resources, both for the country field operations as well as for the UNHCR’s operations around the world.|$|E
50|$|The ITER {{machine is}} {{extraordinarily}} complex, designed to comprise more than 1 million components. This complexity is compounded further by the intricate funding and <b>in-kind</b> <b>contribution</b> of those components by the seven ITER Members - China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union - under the 2006 ITER Agreement. The benefit of this arrangement {{is that the}} major powers pool their best expertise, share the costs, and receive equal access to the intellectual property and technology spin-offs, much like CERN. The challenge, on the other hand, is managing such an arrangement. It is perhaps {{not surprising that the}} ITER project had encountered management shortcomings, cost overruns and delays. A sharply critical 2013 audit, leaked to Raffi Katchadourian at The New Yorker, called for urgent reform.|$|E
