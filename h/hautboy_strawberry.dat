5000|$|The musk {{strawberry}} or hautbois strawberry (Fragaria moschata), is {{a species}} of strawberry native to Europe. Its French name hautbois strawberry may be anglicised as <b>hautboy</b> <b>strawberry.</b> The plants are hardy and can survive in many weather conditions and are cultivated commercially on a small scale, particularly in Italy. The fruit are small and round; they {{are used in the}} gourmet community for their intense aroma and superb flavour, which has been compared to a mixture of regular strawberry, raspberry and pineapple. [...] Popular cultivated varieties include 'Capron' and 'Profumata di Tortona'.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{historical}} landmark is {{the cottage}} Rockend, where the poet Banjo Paterson {{lived in the}} 1870s and 1880s. It was built circa 1850 and is still preserved {{and open to the}} public in Banjo Paterson Park, Punt Road. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate. The site joins the Bedlam Bay walk, where remnants of the Great North Road exists and the walls of the Bedlam Bay Ferry. Banjo Paterson lived in the sandstone house (now a restaurant) whilst attending Sydney Grammar School. The house was owned by his Grandmother and was frequented by many artists and writers. Banjo Paterson recalled in his radio interview in 1935 the river had declined and was now lined with factories. However he could still remember when;"the wood-boat and the fruit boats, something like 7 ton yachts in size and capacity, would hoist mainsail and jib in the early morning, and come howling down the river with the westerly wind behind them, hoping to get far enough down to meet the north-easter before the wind failed. If the wind died away and they were left in the doldrums - well, they didn’t worry. They anchored and caught themselves feeds of fish which they cooked on their little galley fires, the scent of frying re-bream mixing not unhappily with the aroma of guavas, grapes, and the big <b>hautboy</b> <b>strawberries</b> which now seem to have gone out of fashion. Then, when the tide turned, they would up with the anchor and drift down till they opened up to the harbour where there was always some sort of breeze. They would strike Sydney some time or other, and would deliver their cargo into horse-drawn carts and then point the boat’s nose up river again, back to the gardens and the spitting of fire wood with wedges and American axes." ...|$|R
