5|$|You'll Never <b>Eat</b> <b>Lunch</b> in This Town Again is an {{autobiography}} by Julia Phillips, detailing {{her career as}} a film producer and disclosing the power games and debauchery of New Hollywood in the 1970s and 1980s. It was first published in 1991 and became an immediate cause célèbre and bestseller. The book was reissued in 2002 after the author's death.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never <b>Eat</b> <b>Lunch</b> in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E

25|$|As was {{traditional}} in Monaco, {{the race}} {{began at the}} relatively late time of 15:30, allowing Prince Rainier and his family to <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> before viewing the event from the royal box on the start-finish straight. The race took place in warm, sunny conditions, with an ambient temperature of , and was watched {{by a total of}} approximately 48,000 spectators. As the drivers completed their reconnaissance laps from the pit-lane to the starting grid, an oil leak was discovered on Frentzen's Sauber, so he switched to the newly built spare car in time for the start.|$|E

His parents finally enrolled him in school (public or private is not clear). But his discipline problems continued. After one particularly violent temper tantrum, his father tied John's wrists together, tied him to a chest of drawers, and left him there all afternoon without allowing him to <b>eat</b> <b>lunch.</b> When Meigs learned that his son had untied himself, he spanked him with the rope.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his second}} Gubernatorial term, Kean was named President of Drew University, a small liberal arts {{university}} in Madison, New Jersey. Kean's considerable standing as a popular former governor of the state was helpful as he undertook an upgrading of the university's campus and academic programs by stressing the primacy of teaching, the creative use of technology in the liberal arts, and the importance of international education. During Kean’s presidency, applications to Drew increased by more than 40 percent; the endowment nearly tripled; and more than $60 million was committed to construction of new buildings and renovation of residence halls and other older buildings. Kean was extremely popular among the student body; he would frequently <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> unannounced with students in the dining hall, and was a regular spectator at Drew sporting events. Kean served as Drew's President until 2005, teaching a highly selective political science seminar.|$|E
500|$|... "The Steps", {{alternatively}} {{known as}} [...] "Low Steps" [...] or the [...] "Urban Beach", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term {{refers to the}} long series of granite steps leading from {{the lower part of}} campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure. On warm days when the weather is favorable, the Low Steps often become a popular gathering place for students to sunbathe, <b>eat</b> <b>lunch,</b> or play frisbee.|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene when}} Gale's {{neighbor}} calls police to report his murder, a clock in Gale's apartment reads 10:13. This is a deliberate {{reference to the}} number 1013, which frequently appeared in The X-Files, where Vince Gilligan worked {{as a writer and}} producer and Bryan Cranston as an actor. It refers to the name of X-Files creator Chris Carter's production company Ten Thirteen Productions, which in turn is a reference to Chris Carter's birthday, October 13. A copy of Everything's Eventual, {{a collection of short stories}} by Stephen King, can be seen in Gale's apartment. After Walter and Jesse are released by Gus, they <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> at Denny's, a coffee shop and family restaurant chain. During this scene, they are wearing matching T-shirts with country music singer Kenny Rogers on them. The T-shirts are deliberately not explained in the episode, but Vince Gilligan said he believed Mike simply bought the first articles of clean clothing he could find for Walter and Jesse after their clothes were soaked with Victor's blood. During the final scene of [...] "Box Cutter", when Walter walks back to his condominium, the Alex Ebert song [...] "Truth" [...] plays in the background.|$|E

Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street".

500|$|Until March 26, 2008, a -tall {{member of}} the species was a {{prominent}} [...] "centerpiece" [...] of the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in the Astoria section in the borough of Queens in New York City. The tree had been spared by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. The tree {{was the only one}} he left in the yard, and the staff would <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> with Noguchi under it. [...] "n a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree", said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By 2008, the old tree was found to be dying and in danger of crashing into the building, which was about to undergo a major renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven Woodshop, an artists' collective, to use the wood to create benches, sculptures and other amenities in and around the building. The tree's rings were counted, revealing its age to be 75, and museum officials hoped it would regenerate from a sucker.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} episode, comparing it positively to previous episodes [...] "Casino Night" [...] and [...] "Booze Cruise": [...] "not as heavy or emotional, certainly, {{but still a}} chance to see our Dunderheads in a charming and demonstrative not-quite-work environment." [...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E

500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us <b>eat</b> <b>lunch,</b> arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
500|$|The German minesweepers {{made good}} progress, despite minor damage from shell {{splinters}} and numerous near misses by Slava, Grazhdanin, Bayan, and the Russian shore batteries. During this period Slavas front turret became inoperable when a bronze {{rack and pinion}} gear bent so that the gear wheel could not be moved. Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown. Slava and her consorts were ordered north to allow the crews to <b>eat</b> <b>lunch,</b> but returned to the fray and opened fire on the minesweepers again at 10:04 with her rear turret at an approximate range of [...] The minesweepers had cleared a channel to the north while the Russians were eating and the dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage the Russian pre-dreadnoughts.

The first hit Slavas bow, [...] below the waterline, and exploded in the bow dynamo room, flooding that room, the forward 12-inch magazine and other bow compartments, while the second penetrated the capstan flat. The ship took on [...] of water which gave her a list of 8°, later reduced to 4° by counter-flooding. This also increased her forward draft to about [...] The third shell hit the port side armor abreast the engine room, but failed to penetrate. Two more shells struck her at 10:24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel. They damaged a six-inch magazine and the forward stokehold (boiler room) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes. However, the forward left six-inch magazine was flooded as a precaution. At 10:39 two more shells hit her, killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker. Around this time Slava and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while Bayan trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012 Greg Groogan of KRIV said [...] "there's nothing 'Cadillac' {{about the}} school", citing the air conditioners that often fail, small {{classrooms}} in the school's original section {{that were designed}} to house 15 students but routinely host classes of around 40 students, {{and a lack of}} shower facilities. The PE facilities have 15 shower heads to serve the entire male student body, numbering at 1,600.
