40|$|In this study, {{mathematical}} programming models are developed which aim to determine simultaneously the optimum combination of investment decisions, financing methods and tax strategy for capital budgeting, {{taking into account}} tax-induced interactions between cash flows. The tax treatment of finance leases and the corporate group tax relief provisions are included.

The commercial {{mathematical programming}} software XPRESS-MP is utilised to achieve operational use of the models in complex tax situations. A mathematical analysis of certain patterns of accelerated tax depreciation recently available in the UK for capital expenditure is presented. This analysis shows that, where there is a time lag between asset purchase and the incidence of tax relief, an optimal cost of capital may be derived at which the incremental value of the accelerated allowances is at a maximum. In the case of <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>depreciation</b> for plant and machinery, it is shown that this optimal cost of capital is independent of the proportion of the asset cost that may be allowed against tax in the first year.

40|$|The sum-of-years ’ digits {{depreciation}} method is an accelerated depreciation and amortization technique that is acceptable for financial reporting under U. S. and IASB accounting rules. Until 1981, {{it was an}} acceptable method for tax reporting in the U. S., and the aggressive nature of the method was an appealing characteristic for tax returns. Since 1981, {{little attention has been}} paid to its continued use in financial reporting. Academic research tends to group all accelerated {{depreciation method}}s together. However, <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> <b>depreciation</b> methods are more appealing because they are more flexible, are easier to apply to partial periods, and have common characteristics with current U.

It shows what type of companies use this method, what types of assets it is applied to, and what length of asset life is typically chosen. Sum-of-years ’ digits sees its most frequent use in the banking and regulated industries. It is primarily applied to intangible assets, such as acquired customer relationships. What is surprising for the non-regulated companies is that they are amortizing the assets more aggressively for financial reporting than they are for tax reporting.

50|$|Depreciation is {{a method}} of reallocating {{the cost of a}} {{tangible}} asset over its useful life span of it being in motion. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both tax and accounting purposes.The former affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the latter affects the net income that they report. Generally the cost is allocated, as depreciation expense, among the periods in which the asset is expected to be used. This expense is recognized by businesses for financial reporting and tax purposes. Methods of computing depreciation, and the periods over which assets are depreciated, may vary between asset types within the same business and may vary for tax purposes. These may be specified by law or accounting standards, which may vary by country. There are several standard methods of computing depreciation expense, including fixed percentage, straight line, and <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> methods. <b>Depreciation</b> expense generally begins when the asset is placed in service. For example, a depreciation expense of 100 per year for five years may be recognized for an asset costing 500.|$|R

This paper points {{out that there is}} no we 1 1 -defined way to raise capital taxes in general, because the taxation of income from capital depends on many different policy instruments including the statutory corporate income tax rate, the investment tax credit rate, <b>depreciation</b> lifetimes, <b>declining</b> <b>balance</b> rates for <b>depreciation</b> allowances, and personal tax rates on noncorporate income, interest receipts, dividends, and capital gains. Marginal excess burden is measured for each of these different capital tax instruments, using a general equilibrium model that encompasses distortions in the allocation of real resources over time, among industries, between the corporate and noncorporate sectors, and among diverse types of equipment, structures, inventories, and land. Although numerical results are sensitive to specifications for key substitution elasticity parameters, important qualitative results are not. We find that an increase in the corporate rate has the highest marginal excess burden, because it distorts intersectoral and interasset decisions as well as intertemporal decisions. At the other extreme, an investment tax credit reduction has negative marginal excess burden because it raises revenue while reducing interasset distortions more than it increases intertemporal distortions. In general, we find that marginal excess burdens of different capital tax instruments vary significantly. They can be more or less than the marginal excess burden of the payroll tax or the progressive personal income tax. ...|$|R
