Consequently, their diet is primarily made up of grasses and other plants that grow in clearings and savannas.|$|R

50|$|Morelet's {{crocodile}} can {{be found}} in freshwater habitats in Central America and along the Gulf of Mexico stretching through Belize, Guatemala, and to Mexico. The Belizean pine forests are an example of the type of ecoregion in which they occur.In their freshwater habitats, they prefer isolated areas that are secluded. This species of crocodile can mainly be found in freshwater swamps and marshes, which are located inland, and in large rivers and lakes. Both of these habitats are forested to help add cover.The Morelet can also be found along the coast in brackish waters and the <b>grassy</b> <b>savannas</b> on the Yucatán Peninsula. These crocodiles become much more distributed during the rainy seasons when flooding occurs and it is easier for them to move elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|In prehistoric times, {{particularly}} the Miocene epoch, {{portions of the}} landforms now in the area (then marshy and <b>grassy</b> <b>savanna)</b> were populated by {{a wide range of}} now extinct mammals, known in modern times by the fossil remains excavated {{in the southern part of}} the county. In the northern part of the county, significant coal and sand deposits were formed in even earlier geologic eras. Other areas of the county have ridges exposing ancient but intact (not fossilized) seashells, embedded in sandstone layers alternating with limestone. Layers of volcanic ash ejected from geologically recent but now extinct volcanoes, compacted and now tilted by compressive forces, may be seen at the site of some road excavations. This county is an agglomeration of several distinct geologic terranes, as is most of the greater San Francisco Bay Area, which is one of the most geologically complex regions in the world. The great local mountain Mount Diablo has been formed and continues to be elevated by compressive forces resulting from the action of plate tectonics and at its upper reaches presents ancient seabed rocks scraped from distant oceanic sedimentation locations and accumulated and lifted by these great forces. Younger deposits at middle altitudes include pillow lavas, the product of undersea volcanic eruptions.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the organic}} carbon inventory, its stable isotopic {{composition}} and radiocarbon content were used to deduce vegetation history from two soil profiles in arboreal and <b>grassy</b> <b>savanna</b> ecotones in the Brazilian Pantanal. The Pantanal is a large floodplain area with grass-dominated lowlands subject to seasonal flooding, and arboreal savanna uplands which are only rarely flooded. Organic carbon inventories were lower in the <b>grassy</b> <b>savanna</b> site than in the upland arboreal savanna site, with carbon decreasing exponentially with depth from the surface in both profiles. Changes in C- 13 of soil organic matter (SOM) with depth differed markedly between the two sites. Differences in surface SOM C- 13 values reflect the change from C- 3 to C- 4 plants between the sites, as confirmed by measurements of C- 13 Of vegetation and the soil surface along a transect between the upland closed-canopy forest and lowland <b>grassy</b> <b>savanna.</b> Changes of C- 13 in SOM with depth at both sites are larger than the 3 - 4 per mil increases expected from fractionation associated with organic matter decomposition. We interpret these as recording past changes in the relative abundance of C- 3 and C- 4 plants at these sites. Mass balances with C- 14 and C- 13 suggest that past vegetational changes from Cg to Cg plants in the <b>grassy</b> <b>savanna,</b> and in the deeper part of the arboreal savanna, occurred between 4600 and 11 400 sp, when major climatic changes were also observed in several places of the South American Continent. The change from C- 4 to C- 3, observed only in {{the upper part of}} the arboreal savanna, was much more recent (1400 sp), and was probably caused by a local change in the flooding regime...|$|E
