We modelled the net cost of adding <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> for patients with virological failure and retaining patients without resistance on first-line therapy, rather than switching all failures to second-line therapy. Methods Costs were estimated for three scenarios: routine maintenance (standard care without <b>resistance</b> <b>testing,</b> switch all failures to second line); <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure, switch those with resistance); and limited <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure {{in the first three}} years, switch those with resistance). A Markov model was used to estimate the cost of each arm over five years after first line initiation. Rates of treatment failure, viral resistance and treatment costs were estimated with primary data from a large HIV treatment cohort at a public facility in Johannesburg. Future costs were discounted at 3 %. Results Virological failure rates over five years were 19. 8 % in routine maintenance and 20. 2 % in <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> and limited testing; 16. 8 % and 11. 4 % of failures in routine and limited testing, respectively, did not have any resistance mutations, resulting in 3. 1 % and 2. 0 % fewer patients switching to second-line ART by the end of five years. Treatment costs were estimated at US$ 526 and $ 1268 per patient per year on first-line and second-line therapy, respectively; a <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> cost $ 242. The total average cost per patient over five years was $ 2780 in routine maintenance; $ 2775 in resistance testing; and $ 2763 in limited <b>testing.</b> Conclusions Incorporating <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> into treatment guidelines in South Africa is potentially cost-neutral and can identify other reasons for failure, conserve treatment options, and generate information about emerging resistance patterns. </p...|$|R

DESIGN: Multinational cohort study. METHODS: Individuals in EuroSIDA with virological failure (> 1 RNA measurement > 500 on ART after > 6 months on ART) after 1997 were included. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> following virological failure and aORs {{for the detection of}} resistance among those who had a test were calculated using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Compared to 74. 2 % of ART-experienced individuals in 1997, only 5. 1 % showed evidence of virological failure in 2012. The odds of <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> declined after 2004 (global P < 0. 001). Resistance was detected in 77. 9 % of the <b>tests,</b> NRTI <b>resistance</b> being most common (70. 3 %), followed by NNRTI (51. 6 %) and protease inhibitor (46. 1 %) resistance. The odds of detecting resistance were lower in tests done in 1997 - 1998, 1999 - 2000 and 2009 - 2010, compared to those carried out in 2003 - 2004 (global P < 0. 001). <b>Resistance</b> <b>testing</b> was less common in Eastern Europe [aOR 0. 72, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 55 - 0. 94] compared to Southern Europe, whereas the detection of resistance given that a test was done was less common in Northern (aOR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 21 - 0. 39) and Central Eastern (aOR 0. 47, 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 76) Europe, compared to Southern Europe.
