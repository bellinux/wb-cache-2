These cells enter proliferative cycle and progress through G 1 and into S phase {{in the presence of}} cytokines and 5 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HI-FCS). Cytokine-stimulated Lin- <b>Ho(low)</b> /Rho(low) cells took 36 to 40 hours to complete first division and only 12 hours to complete each of 5 subsequent divisions. These cells require 16 to 18 hours to transit through G 0 /G 1 period and 28 to 30 hours to enter into mid-S phase during the first cycle. Up to 56 % of Lin- Rho(low) /Ho(low) cells are high-proliferative potential (7 factor-responsive) colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC). At isolation, HPP-CFC are quiescent, but after 28 to 30 hours of culture, greater than 60 % are in S phase. Isoleucine-deprivation of Lin- <b>Ho(low)</b> /Rho(low) cells in S phase of first cycle reversibly blocked them from entering into second cycle. After the release from isoleucine-block, these cells exhibited a G 1 period of less than 2 hours and entered into mid-S phase by 12 hours. Thus, the duration of G 1 phase of the cells in second cycle is 4 to 5 times shorter than that observed in their first cycle. Similar cell cycle kinetics are observed with Lin-/Sca+ population of bone marrow cells. Stem cell factor (SCF) alone, in the presence of HI-FCS, is as effective as a cocktail of 2 to 7 cytokines in inducing quiescent Lin-/Sca+ cells to enter into proliferative cycle. Aphidicolin treatment reversibly blocked cytokine-stimulated Lin-/Sca+ cells at G 1 /S boundary, allowing their tight synchrony as they progress through first S phase and enter into second G 1. For these cells also, SCF alone is sufficient for their progression through S phase. These studies indicate a very short G 1 phase for stem cells induced to proliferate and offer experimental approaches to synchronize murine hematopoietic stem cells...|$|E

40|$|The nests and nest-building {{behavior}} of the Japanese giant flying squirrel, Petaurista leucogenys, were investigated at shrine groves, afforested areas and villages in the Kyushu and Kanto districts during 1972 - 1982, together with some observation of the nest-building behavior in captivity. Thte results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. The flying squirrel always preferred tree follows to places on branches as the nesting site. A few branch nests were found only in cases which suitable, natural tree hollows were scarce. 2. Density of the nests was highest at shrine groves and lowest at afforested areas. Presence of old and big trees seemed to be advantageous for the animal to get suitable tree hollows. 3. The attic and tree hollow nests were common also in and around villages, thus the animal seemed to be nt affected so much by human activities. 4. This animal showed a preference to tree hollows as the nesting site, whose entrances are 8 - 20 cm in diameter, and was unconcerned about the bulk and ground height of the hollows. The tree <b>holow</b> nests were distributed all over woodlands without distinction of the center and margin. 5. This animal had the nest-building behavior involving two independent devices to utilize tree hollows as the nests, i. e. gnawing small hollow entrances and carrying nest materials into the nests. 6. Frequency of occurrence of the nest-building behavior in Petaurista leucogenys was lower than in Callosciurus caniceps and Sciurus carolinensis. This {{may be caused by}} the facts that the tree hollow nests rarely break and a small amount of the nest material is enough for this animal. 7. This animal had a strong preference to the bark of the Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica, as the nset materials. The nest-building behavior was divided into the following units-peeling, chewing, shredding, folding and bundling of the materials. 8. Some differences in nest material treatment were found between Petaurista leucogenys.
