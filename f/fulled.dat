The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, <b>fulled,</b> dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E

His successor, Henry of Blois, transformed the manor house here into a mighty castle in 1138. Bridgwater Castle {{was built in}} 1202 by William Brewer. It passed to the king in 1233 and in 1245 repairs were ordered to its motte and towers. During the 11th-century Second Barons' War against Henry III, Bridgwater was held by the barons against the King.

500|$|The parish of Exmoor Forest {{was part}} of the Hundred of Williton and Freemanners. During the Middle Ages, sheep farming for the wool trade came to {{dominate}} the economy. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, <b>fulled,</b> dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During the 16th and 17th centuries the commons were overstocked with agisted livestock, from farmers outside the immediate area who were charged for the privilege. This led to disputes about the number of animals allowed and the enclosure of land. In the mid-17th century James Boevey was the warden. The house that he built at Simonsbath {{was the only one in}} the forest for 150 years. When the royal forest was sold off in 1818, John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for £50,000. He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land. He and his family also built most of the large farms in the central section of the moor as well as [...] of metalled access roads to Simonsbath and a [...] wall around his estate, much of which still survives.|$|E

[...] As the place name indicates, Shipley had a history as sheep grazing land, so wool was plentiful, and the River Aire was a ready source of water for powering water mills and cleaning processes. [...] There was a fulling mill in Shipley by 1500 and two more by 1559. [...] Another mill was built by the Dixon family {{on the banks of the}} Aire in 1635. [...] New Mill on the far side of Hirst Wood was built in the 1740s and by the late 18thcentury between 9,000 and 10,000 pieces of broadcloth were being <b>fulled</b> annually at Shipley's mills. [...] Much work was undertaken in workers' cottages which had 'loomshops' for spinning yarn. [...] Home workshops were once a common sight along the River Aire and often had external flights of steps. Examples can be seen in the cottages at Jane Hills along the canal in Saltaire.|$|E
