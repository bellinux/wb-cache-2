25|$|At the 2014 General Assembly of the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI), Dr. Demetrios Matsakis, the United States Naval Observatory's Chief Scientist for Time Services, {{presented}} the reasoning {{in favor of}} the redefinition and rebuttals to the arguments made against it. He stressed the practical inability of software programmers to allow for the fact that leap seconds make time appear to go backwards, particularly when most of them do not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> leap seconds exist. The possibility of leap seconds being a hazard to navigation was presented, as well as the observed effects on commerce.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed instruction manuals had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon that not only did few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had never even seen a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E

[...] Matt Burns of The Post wrote, [...] "Take the polarizing summer single 'SexyBack', a repetitive song with little structure that doesn't know when to stop, all centered on a ridiculous declaration. Somehow, it works." [...] The Diamondbacks Michael Greenwald reported that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was [...] "lyrically, musically and vocally the weakest song" [...] on the album. A writer of The State Journal-Register was not impressed with the song and concluded, with SexyBack' is the most annoyingly dumb song to hit Billboards No. 1 since 'Hollaback Girl'". Guy Blackman of The Sunday Age wrote: [...] "The distorted vocals and stilted production of first single 'Sexyback' make Timberlake's claim to be 'bringing sexy back'... seem almost laughable."

You'd think it takes massive balls to do something like that, but given the shrill, squeaking vocals cheeping through his ghastly little gobhole, it's safe to assume he's got testes the size of capers. He's practically a human dog whistle, the shrieking, high-pitched, mosquito-lunged ponce." ...|$|E

2500|$|The school newspaper, The Towerlight, {{announced}} that in February 2008, the school administration {{was planning to}} implement a [...] "Free Speech Policy". The policy defines several things that would be considered free speech, and that students would be restricted to where they could assemble and have demonstrations or protests. This has caused serious backlash from the students, and has solicited various protests on campus and vocal dissent from the Student Government Association as well. Jenny Haley, the SGA president at the time, said the policy was not discussed nor negotiated with the SGA and that she feels {{it is a mistake}} to exclude students from the decision making process. It was also noted that during a meeting with the administration to discuss the policy, several administrators said that the only input initially solicited from students for the Free Speech policy was from a committee called the Student Leadership Council that consists of student leaders who are in charge of large student groups. Several of the students contested that not only did they not know who was on this committee, but that most of them did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> kind of committee even existed.|$|E
