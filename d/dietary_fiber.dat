40|$|Abstract—The {{possibility}} of application the <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> in production of crackers {{was observed in}} this work, {{as well as their}} influence on rheological and textural properties on the dough for crackers and influence on sensory properties of obtained crackers. Three different <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers,</b> oat, potato and pea fibers, replaced 10 % of wheat flour. Long fermentation process and baking test method were used for crackers production. The changes of dough for crackers were observed by rheological methods of determination the viscoelastic dough properties and by textural measurements. Sensory quality of obtained crackers was described using quantity descriptive method (QDA) by trained members of descriptive panel. Additional analysis of crackers surface was performed by videometer. Based on rheological determination, viscoelastic properties of dough for crackers were reduced by application of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers.</b> Manipulation of dough with 10 % of potato fiber was disabled, thus the recipe modification included increase in water content at 35 %. Dough compliance to constant stress for samples with <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> decreased, due to more rigid and stiffer dough consistency compared to control sample. Also, hardness of dough for these samples increased and dough extensibility decreased. Sensory properties of final products, crackers, were reduced compared to control sample. Application of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> affected mostly hardness, structure and crispness of the crackers. Observed crackers were low marked for flavor and taste, due to influence of fibers specific aroma. The sample with 10 % of potato fibers and increased water content was the most adaptable to applied stresses and to production process. Also this sample was close to control sample without <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> by evaluation of sensory properties and by results of videometer method.

40|$|Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, such as Sphingomonas paucimobilis (S. paucimobilis), {{are among}} the most {{widespread}} causes of nosocomial infections. Up to now, no definitive guidelines exist for antimicrobial therapy for S. paucimobilis infections. As we have shown that some <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> exhibit pronounced immune-regulatory properties, we hypothesized that specific immune active <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> might modulate the responses against S. paucimobilis. We studied the immunomodulatory effects of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> against S. paucimobilis on cytokine release and maturation of human dendritic cells (DCs) in co-cultures of DCs and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). S. paucimobilis infection resulted in increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by DCs/IECs; these effects were strongly attenuated by specific <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers.</b> Chicory inulin, sugar beet pectin, and both starches had the strongest regulatory effects. IL- 12 and TNF-alpha were drastically diminished upon exposure to chicory inulin and sugar beet pectin, or both starches. High-maize 260, was more effective in the reduction of chemokine release than the others fibers tested. In summary, chicory inulin, sugar beet pectin, High-maize 260, and Novelose 330 attenuate S. paucimobilis-induced cytokines. These results demonstrate that <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> with a specific chemical composition can be used to manage immune responses against pathogens such as S. paucimobilis...|$|R

Flaxseeds are a good source of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers,</b> and a large proportion of these are water-soluble viscous fibers. Method Here, we examine the effect of flaxseed <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> in different food matrices on blood lipids and fecal excretion of fat and energy in a double-blind randomized crossover study with 17 subjects. Three different 7 -d diets were tested: a low-fiber control diet (Control), a diet with flaxseed fiber drink (3 /day) (Flax drink), and a diet with flaxseed fiber bread (3 /day) (Flax bread). Total fat and energy excretion was measured in feces, blood samples were collected before and after each period, and appetite sensation registered 3 times daily before main meals. Results Compared to control, Flax drink lowered fasting total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by 12 and 15 %, respectively, (p Conclusion Both Flax drink and Flax bread resulted in decreased plasma total and LDL-cholesterol and increased fat excretion, but the food matrix and/or processing may be of importance.

40|$|Background: Micelle {{formation}} of cholesterol with lecithin and bile salts {{is a key}} process for intestinal absorption of lipids. Some <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> commonly used to reduce the lipid content in the body are thought to inhibit lipid absorption by binding to bile salts and decreasing the lipid solubility. Amongst these, α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) is reportedly {{one of the most}} powerful <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> for decreasing blood cholesterol. However, it is difficult to believe that α-CD directly removes cholesterol because it has a very low affinity for cholesterol and its mechanism of action is less well understood than those of other <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers.</b> To identify this mechanism, we investigated the interaction of α-CD with lecithin and bile salts, which are essential components for the dissolution of cholesterol in the small intestine, and the effect of α-CD on micellar solubility of cholesterol. Results: α-CD was added to Fed-State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FeSSIF), and precipitation of a white solid was observed. Analytical data showed that the precipitate was a lecithin and α-CD complex with a molar ratio of 1 : 4 or 1 : 5. The micellar solubility of cholesterol in the mixture of FeSSIF and α-CD was investigated, and found to decrease through lecithin precipitation caused by the addition of α-CD, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, each of several other water-soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> was added to the FeSSIF, and no precipitate was generated. Conclusion: This study suggests that α-CD decreases the micellar solubility of cholesterol in the lumen of the small intestine via the precipitation of lecithin from bile salt micelles by complex formation with α-CD. It further indicates that the lecithin precipitation effect on the bile salt micelles by α-CD addition clearly differs from addition of other water-soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers.</b> The decrease in micellar cholesterol solubility in the FeSSIF was the strongest with α-CD addition...|$|R
