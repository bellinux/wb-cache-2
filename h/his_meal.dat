5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E

The Commissioner believed that this amount should have been included in income, and determined a tax deficiency. Kowalski argued that the cash meal allowance was not compensatory, but was furnished for the convenience of the employer and therefore wasn’t income under I.R.C. §61(a), and that alternatively, it was excluded under I.R.C. §119.|$|E

25|$|Durvasa {{felt that}} Ambarisha had {{violated}} the respect {{due to a}} guest by breaking his fast before the guest had taken <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> and in his rage created a demon to kill Ambarisha, out of a strand of his hair. Narayana's Sudarshana Chakra intervened, destroyed the demon and started chasing Durvasa himself. Durvasa went to Brahma and Shiva for protection. Both pleaded their inability to save him. Durvasa next went to Narayana himself, {{who said that he}} could do nothing as he was bound by the blemishless devotion of Ambarisha and suggested that the sage seek the king's pardon. Durvasa took this advice and returned to Ambarisha, who prayed to Vishnu to recall the Sudarshana and save the sage, whereby the discus ceased to afflict him.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, {{at the age}} of 80, the Buddha {{announced}} that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place {{had nothing to do with}} his passing and that <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha. Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.|$|E

Most sources agree that they were sent by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins. While dying, Conrad ordered Isabella not to give Tyre to anyone but Richard of England or to the new king of Jerusalem. When Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, who was Philip of France's lieutenant in the Holy Land, urged Isabella to deliver Tyre to him, she shut herself up in the fortress and refused to open its gates.|$|E

25|$|The seafood safari episode {{saw many}} firsts for the Great BBQ Challenge. The first dessert to be cooked {{entirely on the}} BBQ, the first entree and the first tears of the series. Restaurateur Fenton shocked the judges with his {{signature}} dish, the great Aussie pavlova with boozy summer fruits. Darwin cook Lisette served up antipasto and Perth IT professional Laz had all the right flavours with his stir fry vegetables and lamb chops. During the screen test Fenton's explosive nature impressed Mark and Julia while Laz came out on top with his clear delivery and knowledge base. The final challenge was to cook up a seafood feast. Laz's cook in the bag technique came under criticism from Ben as he didn't clean the flat plate between courses and mixed <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> with the charred remains of the previous dish. Fenton's Moreton Bay bugs prepared with Asian flavours, secured the win from the judges and moved him to tears and into the semi finals.|$|E

25|$|Titus' revenge {{may also}} have been {{influenced}} by Seneca's play Thyestes, written in the first century AD. In the mythology of Thyestes, which is the basis for Seneca's play, Thyestes, son of Pelops, King of Pisa, who, along with his brother Atreus, was exiled by Pelops for the murder of their half-brother, Chrysippus. They take up refuge in Mycenae and soon ascend to co-inhabit the throne. However, each becomes jealous of the other, and Thyestes tricks Atreus into electing him as the sole king. Determined to re-attain the throne, Atreus enlists the aid of Zeus and Hermes, and has Thyestes banished from Mycenae. Atreus subsequently discovers that his wife, Aerope, had been having an affair with Thyestes, and he vows revenge. He asks Thyestes to return to Mycenae with his family, telling him that all past animosities are forgotten. However, when Thyestes returns, Atreus secretly kills Thyestes' sons, Pelopia and Aegisthus. He cuts off their hands and heads, and cooks the rest of their bodies in a pie. At a reconciliatory feast, Atreus serves Thyestes the pie in which his sons have been baked. As Thyestes finishes <b>his</b> <b>meal,</b> Atreus produces the hands and heads, revealing to the horrified Thyestes what he has done.|$|E

500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, saw that a few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished <b>his</b> <b>meal.</b> [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of it stuck to his beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, and ate it. [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E

500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4 stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost-typical superhero background.

He said, [...] "I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes [...] Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others." [...] The Houston Chronicles Bruce Westbrook considered it [...] "the best Marvel movie to date, it's as well-written and character-driven as some of today's Oscar contenders, and its story doesn't stall with hollow flamboyance." [...] The Austin Chronicles Kimberly Jones praised the film, the actors, and felt that though an unproven director, [...] "Johnson has just signed <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> ticket with this marriage of big brains, big brawn, and–most happily–big heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode name is {{a parody}} of One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss. [...] The sushi bar that the Simpson family visits is located on a street called Elm Street, a {{reference}} to the A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise. While waiting for Homer to finish <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> at the sushi bar, Bart and Lisa sneak into the bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, [...] "Theme from Shaft" [...] by Isaac Hayes. In the karaoke room, a gentleman introduces himself as Richie Sakai, a reference to a producer on The Simpsons with the same name. He proceeds to sing the 1971 song [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] by Cher. Homer sings his own version of the gospel hymn [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] while listening to Lisa playing her saxophone one last time. When Homer arrives at his home after leaving Moe's Tavern, he hammers on one of the windows of the house and shouts Marge's name.

[...] As Homer awaits his death, he listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape.|$|E
500|$|During the 1938 tour of England, Hassett smuggled a “wet, muddy, and complaining” {{mountain}} goat (put a waistcoat on the goat, {{according to}} some sources) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O'Reilly while the team was staying at Grindleford, after they had fallen asleep. They awoke to unexpected smells and bleating. During the 1948 tour of England, he {{was reported to have}} unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room, and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust. During the same summer, Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function. It was after midnight, but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road. He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he [...] "just thought we'd pop in". The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers. In the Third Test of the same tour, after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook, Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman’s helmet, before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer. During the 1953 tour of England, a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett's jacket. Initially declining the waiter's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning, Hassett acquiesced and while taking off his jacket, noticed a spot on his trousers. He then silently pointed to the spot, removed his trousers and handed them to the waiter, before continuing to eat <b>his</b> <b>meal</b> in his underpants.|$|E
