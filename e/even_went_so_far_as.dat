He <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to launch an invasion of Italy with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire and invited European artists to his capital, including Gentile Bellini.|$|E
5|$|The Dominicans {{soon came}} into {{conflict}} with the established colonists. They refused to take confessions or give sacraments to Spaniards who mistreated Indians, and <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to imprison a dean and excommunicate {{the president of the}} Audiencia Real. Colonial opposition to the actions of the Dominicans reached such dangerous levels that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. Las Casas based himself in the former, and friar Tomás Casillas took charge of Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The territory of Chiapas was subdivided into a number of regions based on prehispanic divisions; these were the Chiapaneca, Lakandon, Mokaya, Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Zoque. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority.|$|E
5|$|When Prince John rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset {{put aside}} their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey {{strengthened}} Doncaster's defences {{and went to}} the aid of Puiset, who was besieging Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself. Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the primacy of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in Maine; Richard over-ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.|$|E

While the DRT initially objected to the Attorney General's report, and <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to file a lawsuit to prevent the transfer, the organization eventually said that it would work with the Texas GLO to preserve the Alamo for future generations.|$|E

25|$|Since {{they were}} not trained in {{building}} design, the padres could only try to emulate the architectural aspects of structures they remembered from their homeland.

Subh-i-Azal gradually alienated himself from {{a large proportion of}} the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants.

25|$|Answering {{the charge}} that Catholics were widely {{supporting}} the abolitionist movement, Bishop England noted that Gregory XVI was condemning only the slave trade and not slavery itself, especially as it existed in the United States.

25|$|On 16 December 1740 Prussian troops invaded Silesia under King Frederick the Great. This was {{the first}} of three Silesian Wars fought between Austria and Prussia in this period (1740–1742, 1744–1745 and 1756–1763). Soon other powers began to exploit Austria's weakness. Charles VII claimed the {{inheritance}} to the hereditary lands and Bohemia, and was supported by the King of France, who desired the Austrian Netherlands. The Spanish and Sardinians hoped to gain territory in Italy, and the Saxons hoped to gain territory to connect Saxony with the Elector's Polish Kingdom.

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2016 by Mathieu Ossendrijver based on tablets {{found in the}} British Museum provides evidence that the Babylonians <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to have a concept of objects in an abstract mathematical space. The tablets date from between 350 and 50 B.C.E., revealing that the Babylonians understood and used geometry even earlier than previously thought. Ossendrijver showed that the Babylonians used a method for estimating the area under a curve by drawing a trapezoid underneath, a technique previously believed to have originated in 14th century Europe. This method of estimation allowed them to, for example, find the distance Jupiter had traveled in {{a certain amount of}} time.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was time}} for him to choose an heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu. Zhu Gaoxu had an athletic-warrior {{personality}} which contrasted sharply with his elder brother's intellectual and humanitarian nature. Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future Hongxi Emperor), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from Xie Jin. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located. He <b>even</b> <b>went</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to undermine Xie Jin's counsel and eventually killed him.|$|E
