5000|$|The outer {{continental}} shelf of Louisiana is laced with listric growth faults, which formed during the Pliocene-Pleistocene Epochs, that detach onto salt-withdrawal surfaces.

[...] Using recent models of salt deformation, seismic interpretation, and section restoration, it has been determined that there are three major salt structures in the Louisiana locality, all forming in the last couple million years. [...] These are reactive <b>diapirs,</b> active <b>diapirs,</b> and passive <b>diapirs.</b> [...] Reactive <b>diapirs</b> initiate and grow beneath grabens from normal faults, by rising up into the top layers of the crust through cracks formed by the grabens.

Like many of the real salt structures, model <b>diapirs</b> p ierced wi thou t developing a pillow stage because they rose along basin margin faults wh ich propagated u p through the overburden from the basement during thick-skinned extension. Once their overburden was weakened by faulting, differential loading forced model <b>diapirs</b> to rise as long as buoyant material was supplied. Some real salt <b>diapirs</b> initially rose as conformable pillows during the early Triassic, became diapiric during middle Triassic and spread broad overhangs during slow sedimentat ion in late Triassic and Jurassic times.

40|$|Salt <b>diapirs</b> {{have been}} modeled {{as having a}} large effect on the thermal {{maturity}} of surrounding sediments {{as a result of}} the high thermal conductivity contrast between halite and other lithologies. The goal of this study was to confirm these and other theoretical predictions through sampling of three salt structures in the western Pyrenees, Spain. Stratigraphic units around these three <b>diapirs</b> were targeted based on their lithologies and positions relative to the <b>diapirs.</b> Samples were analyzed for vitrinite reflectance and quartz cementation to determine their levels of thermal maturity. Remote sensing instruments were used to attempt to measure present day heat flow above the <b>diapirs,</b> and available well logs and seismic data were analyzed to determine the subsurface extent and orientation of the <b>diapirs.</b> Vitrinite reflectance revealed that sediments closest to the Ribera Alta and Orduna <b>diapirs</b> were undermature compared to regional values. The extent of the thermal anomalies around the Ribera Alta and Orduna <b>diapirs</b> extended to approximately 1. 5 times the radii of the <b>diapirs.</b> Samples located above the Gernika salt weld were generally more mature than samples located below the weld, and samples closest to the root of the weld were less mature than samples further from the root. Remote sensing proved ineffective in this locality due to the high moisture content in surface vegetation. Determining the effects of salt on the thermal maturity of surrounding sediments is important because it allows a more comprehensive understanding of source rock maturity and reservoir porosity preservation within the context of petroleum systems in basins that contain salt...|$|R

The {{difference between the two}} <b>diapir</b> bases, is that one, termed a plug-fed thrust, has a sediment cap over the top, preventing the salt from freely flowing until building pressure forces it through the cap; the other, a plug-fed extrusion, lacks the sediment cap and is allowed to flow freely.|$|E

The current deformation style of active salt detachments beneath delta and deep-water fold-thrust belts in the Gulf of Mexico is poorly constrained. The combination of seismic interpretation and seismic attribute analysis provides greater resolution for identifying fault patterns that are otherwise unresolved in conventional seismic amplitude displays. These techniques {{are applied to}} the Ship Shoal and North-West Gulf Coast 3 D seismic volumes, and used to investigate the geometry of low signal amplitudes within six interpreted salt <b>diapirs.</b> The ridge enhancement filter and similarity attributes display a strong correlation with faults and fractures observed over a range of magnitudes, and identify structural relationships between salt <b>diapirs</b> and the surrounding sedimentary overburden. Conventional seismic amplitude displays show salt <b>diapirs</b> as ductile and homogenous structures.

The focus {{of this study is}} on the SW group of the five main groups of large-scale mud <b>diapirs</b> with seabed elevation of 30 m or more above the surrounding seabed and with very complex seabed geometries. Diapiric sediment has been transferred to seabed from deep sources, in places from more than 500 m below modern seabed and from strata more than 24 million years old. Interpretations of the fossil biota, sediment properties and seismic reflection profiles indicate that there is submetre scale heterogeneity in the composition and age of sediments cropping at or near seabed on the large-scale mud <b>diapirs.</b> Interpretations from the seismic reflection profiles and the fossil data from one site on the large-scale <b>diapirs</b> indicate that the large-scale mud diapirism postdates approximately 5 million years ago and might have been initiated as late as 1. 1 million years ago. The evidence suggests that rapid large-scale mud diapirism is not occurring at the present day. In contrast, interpretations of the regional geological setting and the sub-seabed data indicate that there are large areas with potential for modern, active and small-scale diapirism. Reconnaissance sample surveys indicate that some of the steepest slopes on the large-scale <b>diapirs</b> are composed of rock and overlain by thin soft sediments with gravel at seabed. A numerical static stability model is presented that predicts the general conditions under which the modern seabed will become unstable on the large-scale <b>diapirs.</b> The model predicts that thin-skin seabed failures prevent thick accumulations of normally consolidated sediment on the steep flanks of the large-scale mud <b>diapirs.</b> These failures will contribute to the variability of the seabed substrates...|$|R
40|$|Geochemical {{consequences}} of composite <b>diapirs</b> formed in subduction zones {{have been studied}} using a thermomechanical numerical model of an ocean-continent subduction zone. This model includes dehydration of subducted crust, aqueous fluid transport, partial melting, and melt emplacement. Subduction of crustal material to sublithospheric depth results {{in the formation of}} a tectonic rock mÃ©lange composed of basalt, sediment, and hydrated /serpentinized mantle. At asthenospheric depth, this rock mÃ©lange may evolve into partially molten <b>diapirs</b> and rise through the mantle prior to emplacement (relamination) at crustal levels. We have investigated the composition and the geochemical evolution of liquids derived from such composite <b>diapirs</b> by analyzing the differing proportions of the crustal end-members in the source, i. e., basalt and sediment. Our results show that the proportions of the components (in the diapiric mÃ©lange) are limited to short-range variations within an interval of Xb [=volume fraction of basalt/(basalt + sediment) ] = 0. 40. 8, yielding melt with a relatively stable granodioritic major element composition. Hence, granodioritic melt is transported by rising composite <b>diapirs</b> to crustal levels, contributing to the growth of the continental crust. In addition to this, we have calculated Sr and Nd isotopic initial ratios of the diapiric mÃ©lange as a function of time, based on the fraction of the components in the mÃ©lange. Liquids derived from composite <b>diapirs</b> inherit the geochemical characteristics of the composite source and show distinct temporal variations of radiogenic isotopes depending on the changing values of Xb.
