40|$|Abstract. The <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> shelf basin, {{which is}} a fault {{subsidence}} during the Cenozoic Era, locates in the <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> continental shelf. In this paper, balanced section technique {{has been applied to}} analyzing the differential evolution in the <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> shelf basin south of Cenozoic tectonic and summarizing the control factors of tectonic activities on the petroleum accumulation. Our study results will provide essential data and basis for the distribution of the Cenozoic oil and gas and promote the development of the petroleum exploration in the <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> shelf basin. Regional geological overview The <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> shelf basin is located to the east of Fujian and Zhejiang rise regions and also to the west of Diaoyu Island fold belt, and it is a Mesozoic and Cenozoic superimposed basin developed on Craton basement [1]. After the late Mesozoic, multiphase tectonic movement made the tectonic structure of the <b>East</b> China <b>Sea</b> shelf basin was "zoning from east to west and blocking from south to north " in terms of plane and "fault in the east and overtop in the west, and fracture in the lower and depression in the upper [2].

Other important islands include Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks in the <b>East</b> <b>Sea</b> and Ganghwa Island {{at the mouth of the}} Han River. Although the eastern coastline of South Korea is generally unindented, the southern and western coasts are jagged and irregular. The difference is caused by the fact that the eastern coast is gradually rising, while the southern and western coasts are subsiding.|$|E

25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (<b>East</b> <b>Sea</b> of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E
25|$|As {{a part of}} {{traditional}} folklore, dragons appear {{in a variety of}} mythological fiction. In the classical novel Journey to the West, the son of the Dragon King of the West was condemned to serve as a horse for the travellers because of his indiscretions at a party in the heavenly court. Sun Wukong's staff, the Ruyi Jingu Bang, was robbed from Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the <b>East</b> <b>Sea.</b> In Fengshen Yanyi and other stories, Nezha, the boy hero, defeats the Dragon Kings and tames the seas. Chinese dragons also appear in innumerable Japanese anime movies and television shows, manga, and in Western political cartoons as a personification of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese respect for dragons is emphasized in Naomi Novik's Temeraire novels, where they were the first people to tame dragons and are treated as equals, intellectuals, or even royalty, rather than beasts solely bred for war in the West. Manda is a large Chinese dragon that appears in the Godzilla storyline. A golden three-headed dragon also appears in the comic book series God Is Dead.|$|E
25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength. In 1987 the Navy consisted (as it does now) of the naval headquarters in Beijing; three fleet commands – the North Sea Fleet, based at Qingdao, Shandong; the <b>East</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet, based at Ningbo; and the South Sea Fleet, based at Zhanjiang, Guangdong – and about 2,000 ships. The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General Staff Department. In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this protective ring and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E
