25|$|The medical {{name for}} {{bedwetting}} is nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> The condition {{is divided into}} 2 types: primary nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (PNE) and secondary nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>enuresis</b> occurs after {{a patient}} goes through an {{extended}} period of dryness at night (roughly six months or more) and then reverts to nighttime wetting. Secondary <b>enuresis</b> can be caused by emotional stress or a medical condition, such as a bladder infection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enuresis</b> (involuntary urinating in sleep) in children. The {{effect may}} not be {{sustained}} following treatment, and alarm therapy {{may be more effective}} in both the short-term and the long-term. Combining a tricyclic (such as clomipramine) with anticholinergic medication, may be more effective for treating <b>enuresis</b> than the tricyclic alone.|$|E
25|$|New {{studies show}} that {{antipsychotic}} drugs can have {{a side effect of}} triggering <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{bedwetting}} is {{a developmental}} delayâ€”not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only {{a small percentage}} (5% to 10%) of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations. Bedwetting is frequently associated with {{a family history of}} the condition. Nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> is considered primary (PNE) when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (SNE) is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{behavioral}} {{methods are}} recommended as initial treatment. <b>Enuresis</b> alarm therapy and medications {{may be more}} effective but have potential side effects.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists may use a {{definition}} from the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV, defining nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> as repeated urination into bed or clothes, occurring twice per {{week or more}} {{for at least three}} consecutive months in a child of at least 5 years of age and not due to either a drug side effect or a medical condition. Even if the case does not meet these criteria, the DSM-IV definition allows psychologists to diagnose nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> if the wetting causes the patient clinically significant distress.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tofranil among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA). It is mainly used {{in the treatment of}} major depression and <b>enuresis</b> (inability to control urination).|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal <b>enuresis,</b> {{also called}} bedwetting, is {{involuntary}} urination while asleep {{after the age}} at which bladder control usually occurs. Bedwetting in children and adults can result in emotional stress. Complications can include urinary tract infections.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that diet impacts <b>enuresis</b> in children. Constipation and Impacted bowels from poor diet can back up stool in the colon, putting undue {{pressure}} on the bladder creating loss of bladder control.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> {{could be}} the {{presenting}} symptom of type 1 diabetes mellitus, classically associated with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; weight loss, lethargy, and diaper candidiasis may also be present in those with new-onset disease.|$|E
25|$|Bedwetting can be {{connected}} to emotional or physical trauma. Trauma can trigger a return to bedwetting (secondary <b>enuresis)</b> in both children and adults. In addition, caregivers cause some level of emotional trauma when they punish or shame a bedwetting child.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine affects {{numerous}} neurotransmitter systems {{known to}} be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), <b>enuresis</b> and numerous other mental and physical conditions. Imipramine is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in some pain conditions.|$|E
25|$|Primary nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (PNE) is {{the most}} common form of bedwetting. Bedwetting counts as a {{disorder}} once a child is old enough to stay dry, but continues either to average at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or to not sleep dry without being taken to the toilet by another person.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. It is similar in efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide. It has also been used to treat nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, imipramine is used with xylazine to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions.|$|E
25|$|DDAVP is most {{efficient}} {{in children with}} nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine production greater than 130% of expected bladder capacity for age) and normal bladder reservoir function (maximum voided volume greater than 70% of expected bladder capacity for age). Other children who are likely candidates for desmopressin treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|MacDonald (1963) {{observed}} {{in his most}} sadistic patients a triad of childhood cruelty to animals, firesetting and <b>enuresis</b> or frequent bed-wetting. Such maladaptive childhood behaviors often result from poorly developed coping mechanisms. This triad, although not intended to predict criminal behavior, provides the warning signs of a child under considerable stress. Children under substantial stress, particularly in their home environment, frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as these, in order to alleviate the stress produced by their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|It is TGA-labeled for {{migraine}} prevention, also {{in cases}} of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because {{it needs to be}} taken regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression also needs to be treated. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched agent for prevention of frequent tension headaches.|$|E
25|$|Disruptions of PPI are {{studied in}} humans {{and many other}} species. The most studied are deficits of PPI in schizophrenia, {{although}} this disease {{is not the only}} one to be associated with such deficits. They have been noted in panic disorder (Ludewig, et al., 2005), schizotypal personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder(Swerdlow et al., 1993), Huntington's disease, nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> and attention deficit disorder (Ornitz et al. 1992), and Tourette's syndrome (Swerdlow et al. 1994; Castellanos et al. 1996). According to one study, people who have temporal lobe epilepsy with psychosis also show decreases in PPI, unlike those who have TLE without psychosis. Therefore, PPI deficits are not typical to specific disease, but rather tell of disruptions in a specific brain circuit.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are used}} {{primarily}} in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used {{in the treatment of}} a number of other medical disorders, including anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), Neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, trichotillomania, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial cystitis (IC), nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|Acupuncture: While {{acupuncture}} is safe in most adolescents, {{studies done}} to assess its effectiveness for nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> are of low quality.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Enuresis</b> is an [...] "unconscious, involuntary, and nonviolent act and {{therefore}} linking it to violent crime is more problematic than doing so with animal cruelty or firesetting".|$|E
2500|$|Asking {{caregivers}} {{of children with}} sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, <b>enuresis,</b> and behavioral problems; ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychological Psychological issues (e.g., {{death in}} the family, sexual abuse, extreme bullying) are {{established}} {{as a cause of}} [...] (a return to bedwetting), but are very rarely a cause of PNE-type bedwetting. Bedwetting can also be a symptom of a pediatric neuropsychological disorder called PANDAS. When <b>enuresis</b> is caused by a psychological or neuropsychological disorder, the bedwetting is considered a symptom of the disorder. <b>Enuresis</b> has a psychological diagnosis code (see previous section), but it is not considered a psychological condition itself. [...] (See section on psychological/social impact, below) ...|$|E
2500|$|Babies {{have little}} socialized control over {{urination}} within traditions or families {{that do not}} practice elimination communication and instead use diapers. [...] Toilet training {{is the process of}} learning to restrict urination to socially approved times and situations. Consequently, young children sometimes suffer from nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturers have {{designed}} [...] "training pants" [...] which {{bridge the gap}} between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process. [...] These are similar to infant diapers in construction but they can be put on like normal underwear. [...] Training pants are available for children who experience <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Stress Stress {{is not a}} {{cause of}} primary nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (PNE), but is well {{established}} {{as a cause of}} returning to bedwetting (...) [...] Researchers studying children who have yet to stay dry find [...] "no relationship to social background, life stresses, family constellation, or number of residencies." [...] On the other hand, stress is a cause of people who return to wetting the bed. Researchers find that moving to a new town, parent conflict or divorce, arrival of a new baby, or loss of a loved one or pet can cause insecurity, contributing to returning bedwetting.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), its sometimes intolerable side-effect profile was considered more tolerable. Therefore, it became extensively used as a standard antidepressant and later served as a prototypical drug {{for the development of}} the later-released TCAs. Today it is no longer used as commonly, but is sometimes still prescribed as a second-line treatment for treating major depression [...] It has also seen limited use in the treatment of migraines, ADHD, and post-concussive syndrome. Imipramine has additional indications for the treatment of panic attacks, chronic pain, and Kleine-Levin syndrome. In pediatric patients, it is relatively frequently used to treat pavor nocturnus and nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Motivational {{therapy in}} nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> mainly {{involves}} {{parent and child}} education. Guilt should be allayed by providing facts. Fluids should be restricted 2 hours prior to bed. [...] The child {{should be encouraged to}} empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night {{that he or she is}} dry. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. This method is particularly helpful in younger children (<8 years) and will achieve dryness in 15-20% of the patients.|$|E
2500|$|This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5â€“2Hz and having a peak-to-peak amplitude >75 Î¼V. (EEG standards define delta waves to be from 0 to 4Hz, but sleep standards in both the original R model (Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales in the [...] "R sleep scoring manual."), as well as the new 2007 AASM guidelines have a range of 0.5â€“2Hz.) This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal <b>enuresis,</b> sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20â€“50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3.|$|E
2500|$|Sergey Aleksandrovich Golovkin {{was born}} on 26 November 1959, in Moscow, Soviet Union. His father was an alcoholic, and his parents {{divorced}} in 1988. Golovkin {{was born with a}} birth defect in his sternum, often suffering from bronchitis and indigestion. In school, Golovkin was considered a loner, and his male classmates noted how he had no interest in girls. He was known to have suffered from <b>enuresis,</b> and was afraid that his classmates would smell his urine. Golovkin was a classmate of Armen Grigoryan, the future front-man of Krematorij. When Golovkin was 13-years-old he began to show [...] tendencies, including catching a cat in the street and bringing it home, where he hanged it.|$|E
2500|$|Prior and Glaser {{describe}} the lists as [...] "wildly inclusive" [...] and state {{that many of}} the behaviors in the lists are likely to be the consequences of neglect and abuse rather than located within the attachment paradigm. Descriptions of children are frequently highly pejorative and [...] "demonizing". Examples given from lists of attachment disorder symptoms found on the internet include lying, avoiding eye contact except when lying, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, fascination with fire, blood, gore and evil, food related issues (such as gorging or hoarding), cruelty to animals and lack of conscience. They also give an example from the Evergreen Consultants in Human Behavior which offers a 45-symptom checklist including bossiness, stealing, <b>enuresis</b> and language disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Children {{may have}} {{problems}} with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as it sends a [...] "message of permission" [...] to urinate in their sleep. [...] Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, {{and that of the}} children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet. In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these [...] "comfort" [...] cases, and that [...] "these behaviors are a significant cause of <b>enuresis</b> and incontinence." [...] He called for further studies to be done on the topic.|$|E
