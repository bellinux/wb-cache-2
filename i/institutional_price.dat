Forced transactions represent a significant cost of financial distress for mutual funds.

40|$|States support higher {{education}} affordability by providing direct funding to {{higher education}} institutions (i. e., state appropriations) and students (i. e., financial aid). However, research examining {{the effectiveness of these}} state expenditures on higher education – and which types students receive the greatest benefit from these expenditures – is sparse. In this study, I examine the relationship between state higher education student financial aid policy and <b>institutional</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviors, focusing on pricing differences across student need and academic ability. Drawing on concepts from the principal-agent framework, resource dependence theory, and previous research on this state-institution relationship (i. e., Doyle, Delaney, & Naughton, 2009), I hypothesize that <b>institutional</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviors respond to changes in state aid in one of three ways: comply with, compensate for, or absorb state financial aid expenditures. Using a combination of state-, institutional-, and student-level data for the academic years 2003 - 04, 2007 - 08, and 2011 - 12, I examine the interactive effects of state financial aid expenditures and student characteristics on <b>institutional</b> <b>pricing</b> behaviors. In addition, I explore the possibility that the direction and magnitude of these interactive effects differ depending on the degree of institutional dependence on state appropriations. I find that institutions respond to changes in state need-based and non-need-based student financial aid expenditures in systematic ways. Findings indicate that institutional aid and net price shift toward alignment with changes in state need- and non-need-based aid expenditures. Moreover, in the analyses that examined differences by institutional appropriation dependence, results suggest that less appropriation dependent institutions are most responsive to state financial aid changes. As public higher education tuition levels continue to rise (Baum, 2013) and affordability among the neediest students declines (Burd, 2014), state higher education finances will continue play central role in the future of higher education access and student success. Findings from this study highlight the importance of continued state investment in need-based student financial aid to promote higher education affordability...|$|R

40|$|Tax-based federal {{student aid}} [...] the Hope Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Tax Credit and Tuition Deduction [...] marks a new {{paradigm}} for federal aid by offering tax incentives for postsecondary enrollment aimed at the middle-class. In this dissertation, I examine how the programs impact postsecondary enrollment, how colleges and universities respond to the programs, and I explore how taxpayers who are limited to one program select among the three options. In the first Chapter, I exploit policy-induced variation in tax-based aid eligibility to estimate its casual effect on college enrollment. I find that tax-based aid increases full-time enrollment {{in the first two}} years of college for 18 - 19 year-olds by 2. 2 percentage points (6. 7 percent). Yet, the enrollment increase comes at a steep price. Between 7 and 13 inframarginal youths are subsidized for each marginal youth that is induced to enroll in college. In the second chapter, I explore how colleges and universities respond to tax- based federal student aid. I demonstrate the importance of benefit incidence analysis by showing that the intended cost reductions of tax-based federal student aid are substantially offset by <b>institutional</b> <b>price</b> increases. Contrary to the goal of policymakers, I find that tax-based aid crowds out institutional aid dollar-for-dollar. Unfortunately, it is not clear how institutions utilize these captured resources, so that the ultimate incidence of the programs is uncertain. In the third chapter, I show that roughly one in five taxpayers who are eligible for more than one tax-based federal student aid program, and who are limited to one program per student per year, select a program that offers a smaller reduction in combined federal and state tax liability. I offer three explanations for this pattern of tax-based aid selection, including salience in program value, tax evasion and inertia in program selection. Collectively, the results from these chapters suggest that the benefits of tax- based federal student aid have come at a heavy price. The modest postsecondary enrollment increase for middle-income youths is achieved via a substantial transfer to colleges and universities, while complexity in program rules introduces substantial frictions for taxpayer...|$|E
40|$|This study extends {{two bodies}} of research, one that {{analyzes}} <b>institutional</b> <b>price</b> response to student financial aid {{and a second}} that examines the effect of state merit-based aid programs on institutions, by examining changes in tuition and fees, room and board charges, and institutional aid expenditures following {{the introduction of the}} Bright Futures merit-based aid program in Florida. Applying an economic theoretical framework to postsecondary education pricing, this study explores how institutions respond to the introduction of a new aid subsidy and how this response varies for different types of postsecondary institutions. Using descriptive and ordinary least squares regression analyses that include year fixed-effects and other controls, this study uses institutional data for the 1993 - 1994 to 2000 - 2001 academic years from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and the Florida Bright Futures program to explore postsecondary price changes in Florida relative to a control group of institutions in selected southeastern states. The findings show that the introduction of Bright Futures was associated with an increase in tuition and fees at public four-year and public two-year institutions in Florida as well as an increase in room and board rates in public four-year institutions in Florida but no change in price at private four-year institutions in Florida. Some caution is warranted in interpreting these findings to mean that the aid subsidy alone caused the increase in price because the analyses show no change in price at institutions in Florida with the highest concentration of Bright Futures scholarship recipients. One explanation for the change in price in public sector institutions is that Florida had such low tuition rates relative to the U. S. average that Florida policymakers acted to close the price gap with surrounding states. The absence of a significant price change at private four-year institutions in Florida and institutions with high concentrations of Bright Futures recipients may suggest that these institutions responded to the increased flow of scholarship recipients by becoming more academically selective rather than by increasing their price. The study's findings have implications for policy and research. Specifically, the findings highlight the need for states to monitor the effect of state financial aid programs on prices in each sector in order to determine what portion of the subsidy is captured by students and what portion is captured by institutions. The study also identifies directions for future research...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{order flow}} competition and institutional trading in modern global financial markets. It {{consists of three}} essays addressing issues on the performance drivers of an alternative trading platform, the impact of HFT activity on institutional execution cost, and broker trading behaviour and market share in the primary market. The empirical findings in these essays provide valuable insights {{into a number of}} market participants, such as sophisticated and institutional investors, brokers, regulators, exchange market operators and academics. The first essay, presented in Chapter 4, examines the determinants of Chi-X’s market share in a global context. The introduction of alternative trading venues that compete with listing exchanges has been brought about by regulatory reform and technological advances over the past decade. This essay is the first study into the performance drivers of a prominent alterative trading venue (Chi-X) in an international context. The findings in this essay contribute to the understanding of factors that influence a trader’s order routing decision and ultimately a venue’s market share. The results indicate that Chi-X's market share is negatively related to trading fees and latency relative to the primary exchange, while differences in adverse selection risk have an immaterial effect. Chi-X's market share is found to be positively related to liquidity relative to the primary exchange, measured by bid-ask spread, depth and percentage time that it displays best bid or offer. Venue market share is negatively related to order-to-trade ratio and positively related to average trade size, which suggests a trader’s preference to interact with natural and accessible liquidity. Furthermore, trading tends to concentrate on the primary exchange during market downturns and when volatility is high, while tick constraint stocks tend to trade more on Chi-X to avoid queuing at the touch on the primary exchange. Moreover, there is an improvement in market liquidity in regions where Chi-X was introduced during relatively normal market conditions. The second essay, presented in Chapter 5, examines the presence of High Frequency Trading (HFT) around large institutional trades and their price impact on NASDAQ and NYSE. The findings contribute to the understanding of HFT around institutional trades and its effect on realised execution costs. The focus on <b>institutional</b> <b>price</b> impact adds to the current literature around HFT's impact on conventional market quality metrics, such as spreads and depth, while addressing concerns that HFT adds to the difficulty of executing institutional orders, despite its perceived association with liquidity provision. The results in this chapter indicate that the impact of HFT participation on institutional execution costs vary between buy trades and sell trades. This essay also documents that institutional buy trades present higher execution costs, when the level of HFT participation is high. In contrast, institutional sell trades could be executed at better prices {{with a high level of}} HFT participation. The contrasting results can be attributable to the difference in the nature of HFTs and their respective ability and costs to short sell. Moreover, there is no evidence that HFT activities are beneficial or detrimental for the largest five percent of institutional trades. The third essay, presented in Chapter 6, studies the trading volume and market shares of brokers surrounding Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs) in the Australian primary market based on a unique broker ID dataset provided by ASX. Further regression analysis is conducted in this essay to examine the key determinants of the behaviour of affiliated and unaffiliated brokers around SEOs. The findings contribute to the understanding of broker affiliation around SEOs as well as providing insights into the key factors that influence a broker’s market share. The results suggest that broker affiliation has a significant impact on broker trading volume and market share on both the announcement days and issuance days. However, there is no significant evidence showing that lead managers or co-managers outperform other underwriters. Rather, the results indicate that co-managers are not expected to gain any abnormal volume or market share. Moreover, broker reputation, market capitalisation and relative offer size of the offering firm are shown as the primary characteristics influencing broker performance.

40|$|Abstract: In three essays, the {{implications}} of the costly contracting approach in accounting are investigated. First, the consequences of changing the set of acceptable accounting techniques in the banking and insurance industry are examined. The regulations imposed by a government agency alter the contracting equilibrium and cause some contractual parties to wield more power in the new equilibrium. Second, the contractual function of accounting earnings, cash flows, and accruals as <b>institutional</b> <b>prices</b> is used to predict their cross-sectional and dynamic statistical behavior. These properties of accounting numbers are the outcome of an evolutionary process in which procedures survive only if they are efficient within the contracting mechanism of firms. Cross-sectional differences in the properties of these numbers {{can be explained by the}} wide variety of contracting mechanisms employed by firms, each of which face a myriad of contracting partners and circumstances. Managers are found to use accounting earnings to improve contracting with outside parties. Third, the organization of audit firms is examined. The organizational architecture of audit firms is related to the role of auditing in a firm's contracting process. The value of the services provided by auditors as adjudicators depends on the degree to which they are able to guarantee the independence and competence of their certification procedures. The contractual arrangements of audit firms are explored, primarily focussing on the changes that occur owing to limiting the legal liability of auditors. The efficiency of the organization of the firm is evaluated in terms of the 'fit' between its contractual arrangements and the demands placed on the audit firm by customers and by owners of production factors. ...|$|R

40|$|We review {{basic facts}} about higher {{education}} finance in the United States and analytical, empirical and policy issues in that realm. Examining trends {{in higher education}} finance, we demonstrate growth in the share of revenues provided by government up to about 1980, with a steady decline thereafter. Student financial aid, a feature of growing importance, is awarded to students on the basis both of financial need and academic (and other) merit, with merit influencing not only total amounts of aid received but also the "quality" of aid packages, as indexed by the fraction of aid {{in the form of}} grants rather than loans or work. Although nearly two-thirds of American high school graduates now attend some form of post-secondary education, both whether and where they attend are importantly influenced by family background. Among students who score well on aptitude tests in high school, 95 % of those from affluent family backgrounds attend college immediately following graduation, while only about 75 % of those from low SES backgrounds do. High-income students {{are also more likely to}} attend private universities and colleges than are lower-income students, who are particularly likely to attend community colleges. Much more attention has been devoted to examining the demand for higher education than to explaining its supply. We review a number of topics on the supply side, including the state of evidence concerning the pricing and output levels of government financed and of nonprofit institutions as well as concerning the impact of government financial aid policies on <b>institutional</b> <b>pricing</b> and aid decisions.

If there is a gap between market and shadow prices, this raises a question. By what set of prices are the economic agents' actions guided?
