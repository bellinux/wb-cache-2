5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child characters are {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear. Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same <b>free</b> <b>range</b> of motion associated with hand-drawn characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed that the type of veal that was being used was more-likely to be <b>free</b> <b>range</b> veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply no way a $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it was not because of the boycotts but because {{there was a lack of}} consumer demand. In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E

25|$|Except {{for a few}} {{flocks of}} toms kept for semen production, {{commercial}} turkeys generally never live past {{the point at which}} they reach market weight. Heritage turkeys are capable of the full normal lifespan of wild turkeys. Breeding hens are commonly productive for 5–7 years and breeding toms for 3–5 years.

25|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. Cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, prompting some farmers to use beak trimming as a preventative measure, although reducing stocking rates would eliminate these problems.

In South-East Asia, a lack of disease control in <b>free</b> <b>range</b> farming has been associated with outbreaks of Avian influenza.|$|E

25|$|Javas {{are valued}} for their dual-purpose characteristics. Though they are slow-growing {{compared}} to the broilers used by the commercial chicken industry today, they produce a good carcass. Hens lay a respectable amount of large, brown eggs and will go broody. Javas are particularly known as good foragers, needing less supplementary feed than many breeds when allowed to <b>free</b> <b>range.</b> Like many large breeds, they {{are known to be}} docile in temperament, and hardy in inclement weather. In general, Javas are particularly suitable for keepers of smaller flocks who require a good dual-purpose chicken.|$|E
25|$|At the outset, it {{was only}} {{intended}} for the breed to be white in color; white birds are preferred for commercial meat production in the West, as they produce a particularly clean-looking carcass. In the 1930s, the Partridge Chantecler was generated by crossing Partridge Wyandottes, Partridge Cochins, Dark Cornishes, and the rose comb type of Brown Leghorns to produce a chicken more adapted to <b>free</b> <b>range</b> conditions.

Thus, most keepers keep Sebrights in confinement rather than allowing them to <b>free</b> <b>range.</b> [...] Due to their genetic make-up, males may on occasion be born infertile, further complicating breeding.|$|E

40|$|In {{automated}} transport systems, the origin-destination combinations {{are normally}} connected through a fixed layout, not representing the shortest path. The flexibility {{of these systems}} is limited and often the infrastructure is not optimally used. With the introduction of more powerful onboard computers and advanced sensor technology, the positioning and navigating possibilities of AGVs increased. However the routes, although virtual, are still fixed. A new step ahead would be to determine each path dynamically. This would use the <b>free</b> <b>ranging</b> capacities of AGVs to its full potential.

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{primates}} are considered seasonal breeders, but {{the set of}} factors, such as food availability, day length and temperature, that influence the timing of reproductive events for both wild and captive individuals remains unclear. Here, we examine the role of factors in shaping breeding patterns in Rhinopithecus roxellana, a temperate colobine primate. We used circular statistics to describe and compare the patterns of reproductive seasonality among individuals in 13 captive groups and two <b>free</b> <b>ranging</b> but provisioned groups at various locations throughout China. Almost 90 % of births occurred in March, April and May in adult females residing in both <b>free</b> <b>ranging</b> (n =  131) and captive groups (n =  407). Births occurred principally in 2 – 4 {{months prior to the}} peak of food availability, while conceptions occurred in 1 – 2 months after the peak of food availability in <b>free</b> <b>ranging</b> but provisioned groups. Day length (latitude) had a significant effect on the timing of reproduction. However, females that experienced a wide variation of temperature between the lowest and highest monthly average temperature had a later conception date. These results support that day length and temperature might be factor influencing the timing of reproductive activity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSilicon-on-insulator {{racetrack}} resonators {{can be used}} as multiplexers in wavelength division multiplexing applications.
