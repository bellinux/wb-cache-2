The group includes Blokkøya, Kvalbeinøya and Havmerra. The islets are named after Christian Schare, who along with four others, was forced to overwinter here after they <b>had</b> lost <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> <b>on</b> September 3, 1833. All but one (who had died) were saved on June 22, 1834.|$|R

After its escape was engineered by Wheelie {{in an effort to}} get to <b>their</b> <b>ship,</b> the Decepticons pursued it but appeared once again as Wheelie and the alien attempted to flee the planet in a rocket, wounding Varta. Wheelie let them take the rocket to save the alien's life. However, Wheelie had sabotaged the rocket and it exploded, taking the Decepticons with it.|$|R
60|$|To a {{newcomer}} Columbina certainly offered no special attractions. Only {{a few years}} before it had been nothing but a point where the ranchmen <b>had</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>their</b> steers <b>on</b> the railroad, with a tiny stockyard and a small ranchmen's hotel and saloon combined. Now the boom city, if such it might be called, consisted of a long straggling main street with a much dilapidated boardwalk on one side only. In {{the middle of the street}} the mud was all of a foot deep, and through this wagons and automobiles plowed along as best they could. All of the buildings were of wood, and none of them more than three stories in height. There were half a dozen general stores, the same number of eating and drinking places, and two buildings which were designated as hotels, O'Brian's being one and Smedley's the other. There was also a long, shed-like moving picture theater advertised to be open twice a week, in the evening.|$|R
60|$|Here I {{found my}} first Captain's widow alive, who had buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances, and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after I {{went down to}} Yorkshire, where all my family were expired, except two sisters, and as many {{of one of my}} brother's children. I found no {{provision}} had been made for me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that I was but in a very slender station. Indeed the Captain did me a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I <b>had</b> delivered <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> <b>on</b> the Desolate Island, upon which they made me a present of 200L. sterling. I next went to Lisbon, taking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I met the Portuguese Captain who had taken me on board on the African coast; but, being ancient, he had left off the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that we did not know each other at first, till I discovered myself more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began to enquire of my concerns; and then the old gentleman {{told me that it was}} nine years since he had been at Brazil, where my partner was then living, but my trustees were both dead; that he believed I should have a good account of the product of my plantation; that the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my trustees to give an estimate of my share to the procurator fiscal, who, in case of my not returning, had given one third to the king & the rest to the monastery of St. Augustine: but if I put in my claim, or any one for me, it would be returned, except the yearly product which was given to the poor. I then desired him to tell me what improvement he thought had been made of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my while to look after it? he answered, he did not know how much it was improved; but this he was certain of, that my partner was grown vastly rich upon his half of it; and, that he had been informed, that the kind had 200 moidores per annum of his third part. He added, that the survivors of my trustees were nervous of an ingenuous character; that my partner could witness my title, my name being registered in the country, by which means I should indefensibly recover considerable sums of money, but, answered, I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made you only my heir? This, said he, was true but, there being no affidavit made of my death he could not act as my executor. However, he had ordered his don,(then at Brazil), to act by procuration upon my account, and he had taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted himself for eight years with my partner and trustees for the profits, of which he would give me a very good account.|$|R
