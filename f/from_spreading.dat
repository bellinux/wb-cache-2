5|$|Some of {{the moons}} of Saturn, {{including}} Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection <b>from</b> <b>spreading.</b> However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, a {{wildfire}} {{among the}} hills adjacent to Machu Picchu threatened the site until fire fighters could cut {{a ring of}} trees to prevent the fire <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> to the ruins. In early 2010, heavy rainfall affected Machu Picchu and Cuzco. On January 25, 2010, 2,000 tourists were stranded near Machu Picchu when a landslide blocked the railroad connecting the site with Cuzco. The tourists were evacuated by ten helicopters, including four from the United States military on loan from the embassy in Lima.|$|E
5|$|In Metroid Fusion, Samus {{returns to}} SR388, where a {{parasitic}} organism infects and nearly kills her. Galactic Federation scientists surgically remove {{large portions of}} her corrupted Power Suit and inject her with the Metroid hatchling's DNA to save her. To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to crash into the planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} they had returned, the attack began. Indian warriors set fire to several houses and stables, but a {{favorable}} wind kept the fires <b>from</b> <b>spreading.</b> Children used the water drawn by the women {{to put out the}} fires. A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection <b>from</b> <b>spreading.</b> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Hong Kong's {{transfer}} to China, the territory has suffered coincidentally an economic double-blow: Asian Financial Crisis and the H5N1 avian flu pandemic. The then-Financial Secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, adopted a radical measure {{to make use}} of British Hong Kong foreign currency reserves and restored Hong Kong's financial stability. In December 1997, officials had to destroy 1.4 million livestock in order to contain the H5 virus <b>from</b> <b>spreading.</b>|$|E

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The forward section capsized almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors <b>from</b> <b>spreading,</b> many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E

5|$|The {{centre of}} these {{architectural}} developments was the region encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived {{as evidence of}} the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the Kalyani region in the northeast to the Bellary region in the east and to the Mysore region in the south. In the Bijapur–Belgaum region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the Hemadpanti temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples {{can be found in the}} Konkan region, the presence of the Western Ghats probably prevented the style <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> westwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} killed 159 men, {{and destroyed}} {{both of the}} rear turrets. The fire was prevented <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> to the shell magazines, which could have destroyed the ship, by the quick action of the executive officer, who ordered both magazines be flooded. The Pumpenmeister Wilhelm Heidkamp was severely injured when he turned the red-hot valves to flood the magazines. At 11:01, Seydlitz struck back at Lion, and with a single 28cm shell, knocked out two of Lions engines. Shortly thereafter, a pair of 30.5cm shells fired by Derfflinger struck Lion, one at the waterline. The penetration allowed water to enter the port feed tank—this hit eventually crippled Lion, the sea water contamination forced the ship's crew {{to shut down the}} port engine. At 11:25, Seydlitz was struck on her armored belt amidships by a third and final shell, which did little damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{marginalization}} of the Iranian Bahá'ís by current governments {{is rooted in}} historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement <b>from</b> <b>spreading</b> by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions. Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Bahá'ís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Bahá'í community and its institutions were initiated. In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Bahá'ís were killed. Bahá'í schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Bahá'í marriages were not recognized and Bahá'í texts were censored.|$|E
