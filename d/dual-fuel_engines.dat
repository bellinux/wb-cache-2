40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Natural gas {{substitution}} for diesel {{can result in}} significant reduction in pollutant emissions. Based on current fuel price projections, operating costs would be lower. With a high ignition temperature and relatively low reactivity, natural gas can enable promising approaches to combustion engine design. In particular, the combination of low reactivity natural gas and high reactivity diesel may allow for optimal operation as a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine, which has potential for high efficiency and low emissions. In this computational study, a lean mixture of natural gas is ignited by direct injection of diesel fuel in {{a model of the}} heavy-duty CAT 3401 diesel <b>engine.</b> <b>Dual-fuel</b> combustion of natural gas-diesel (NGD) may provide a wider range of reactivity control than other dual-fuel combustion strategies such as gasoline-diesel dual fuel. Accurate and efficient combustion modeling can aid NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> control and optimization. In this study, multi-dimensional simulation was performed using a nite-volume computational code for fuel spray, combustion and emission processes. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and multi-zone reaction modeling enables simulation in a reasonable time. The latter approach avoids expensive kinetic calculations in every computational cell, with considerable speedup. Two approaches to combustion modeling are used within the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework. The first approach uses direct integration of the detailed chemistry and no turbulence-chemistry interaction modeling. The model produces encouraging agreement between the simulation and experimental data. For reasonable accuracy and computation cost, a minimum cell size of 0. 2 millimeters is suggested for NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> combustion. In addition, the role of different chemical reaction mechanism on the NGD dual-fuel combustion is considered with this model. This work considers fundamental questions regarding combustion in NGD dual-fuel combustion, particularly about how and where fuels react, and the difference between combustion in the dual fuel mode and conventional diesel mode. The results show that in part-load working condition main part of CH 4 cannot burn and it has significant effect in high level of HC emission in NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> The CFD results reveal that homogeneous mixture of CH 4 and air is too lean, and it cannot ignite in regions that any species from C 7 H 16 chemical mechanism does not exist.

50|$|Petrol/gasoline {{engines are}} limited in the variety {{and quality of the}} fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a {{carburetor}} required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary air-fuel ratio for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the compression ratio of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too low an octane rating), the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels.
