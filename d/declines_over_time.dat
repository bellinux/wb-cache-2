5|$|Voyager 1 {{has three}} {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs) {{mounted on a}} boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power {{at the time of}} launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs <b>declines</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> (due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples), but the craft's RTGs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity <b>declines</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E

50|$|Heteroskedasticity {{occurs when}} the amount of error is {{correlated}} with an independent variable. For example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income. Low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. Heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. For example, as statistical offices improve their data, measurement error decreases, so the error term <b>declines</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{reservation}} wage {{may change}} <b>over</b> <b>time</b> {{if some of}} the conditions assumed by McCall are not met. For example, a worker who fails to find a job might lose skills or face stigma, in which case the distribution of potential offers that worker might receive will get worse, the longer he or she is unemployed. In this case, the worker's optimal reservation wage will <b>decline</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Likewise, if the worker is risk averse, the reservation wage will <b>decline</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> if the worker gradually runs out of money while searching. The reservation wage would also differ for two jobs of different characteristics; that is, there will be a compensating differential between different types of jobs.|$|R

50|$|VEGF-A and the {{corresponding}} receptors are rapidly up-regulated after traumatic injury of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). VEGF-A is highly expressed in the acute and sub-acute stages of CNS injury, but the protein expression <b>declines</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> This time-span of VEGF-A expression corresponds with the endogenous re-vascularization capacity after injury. This would suggest that VEGF-A / VEGF165 could be used as target to promote angiogenesis after traumatic CNS injuries. However, there are contradicting scientific reports about the effects of VEGF-A treatments in CNS injury models.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture in Belarus is a {{shrinking}} {{sector of the}} Belarusian economy. The share of agriculture in GDP declined from 11.6% in 2000 to 7.4% in 2007, while the share of agriculture in total employment dropped from 14.1% to 9.9% over the same period. The decrease in agricultural employment is a long-term trend and {{back in the early}} 1990s agriculture's share was as high as 19% of the number of employed. The decrease of agricultural labor parallels the general urbanization trends, as the share of rural population in Belarus steadily <b>declines</b> <b>over</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
