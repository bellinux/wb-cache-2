He was gelded both for his temperament as well as his lack of good breeding, which meant that he would have been unlikely to be in much demand as a breeding stallion. A Golden Chance Farm foal, John Henry was from breeding that might best be described as plebeian. His sire, Ole Bob Bowers, once sold for just $900 and was not in much demand by breeders. His dam, Once Double, was an undistinguished runner and producer, but was sired by Double Jay, a graded stakes race winner who had proven to be a useful broodmare sire.|$|R
40|$|Abstract - Maternal {{behaviour}} {{and contact}} between {{cow and calf}} is limited or absent in modern dairy systems due to the wide use of <b>bucket</b> <b>feeding.</b> This {{is also the case}} in organic dairy systems. An increasing number of individual farmers are not satisfied with the artificial <b>bucket</b> <b>feeding</b> system. In order to improve the welfare of their dairy cattle, a number of organic farms introduced suckling systems. On the dairy farms that make use of a suckling system calves are suckled by their mother or a nurse cow, for a duration that ranges from three days up to three months. We evaluated on-farm the growth and production of calves reared in a <b>bucket</b> <b>feeding</b> system or a suckling system. Suckling systems make better use of the growing potential of calves in the first months of their lives. A high weaning weight may result in a lower age at first calving and a higher weight at calving. Higher bodyweight at calving also has a positive effect on milk production in the first lactation. ...|$|R

Horses were placed in stalls equipped with 2 buckets hung {{side by side on}} a wall. To familiarize horses with 2 options of <b>feed</b> <b>buckets,</b> each was given 10 min in the stall with 1 kg oats per bucket. A 6 x 6 Latin square with a 3 x 2 factorial treatment structure was used.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} and evaluate two interventions, Ergo Bucket Carrier (EBC) and Easy Lift (EL), for youths (and adults) to handle water/feed buckets on farms. BackgroundThe physical activities of both adult and youth farm workers contribute to the development of low-back disorders (LBDs). Many of the activities youths perform on farms are associated with increased LBD risk, particularly, the handling of water and <b>feed</b> <b>buckets.</b> MethodsSeventeen adult and youth participants (10 males and seven females) participated in this study. To assess the risk of LBDs, the participants were instrumented with a three-dimensional spinal electrogoniometer while lifting, carrying, and dumping water buckets using traditional method and the two interventions. ResultsFor both the adult and youth groups, the results showed that the two interventions significantly decrease the magnitudes of LBD risk in many of the tasks evaluated. Overall, the use of the EBC resulted in a 41 % reduction in the level of LBD risk for the carrying task, and a reduction of 69 % for the dumping task. Using the EL, on the other hand, is especially effective for lifting tasks (55 % reduction in LBD risk). Results of the subjective response were consistent with the objective evaluations. ConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential for ergonomic interventions in reducing LBD risk during the common farming task of bucket handling. ApplicationPotential application of this study includes the introduction of the EBC and EL in family farms to reduce the LBD risk among youth and adult farmers.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the prevalence of pyloric and fundic abomasal lesions in Swiss veal calves at slaughter and to compare the occurrence of non-perforating abomasal lesions between two different production programs ('Naturafarm' and 'conventional'). 'Conventional'-production settings met the minimal standards as defined by the Swiss animal welfare legislation, whereas 'Naturafarm' production complied with increased animal welfare requirements. In order to identify risk factors for the development of abomasal lesions, information on management, housing, and feeding was obtained by a questionnaire. A total of 125 abomasa were randomly selected in one large abattoir. They were examined macroscopically, and the occurence of lesions in either the fundic or pyloric region of the abomasum was recorded separately. Animals raised in the 'conventional'-production setting revealed a significantly higher prevalence of lesions in the fundic part.

40|$|That {{data from}} polar {{orbiting}} satellites have detected a widespread increase in photosynthetic activity {{over the last}} 20 years in the grasslands of the Sahel is justifies investigating {{its role in the}} tropical carbon cycle. But this task is undermined because ground data that are generally used to support the use of primary production models elsewhere are lacking. In this paper, we profile a Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model of primary production parameterised with satellite information, and test it for the West African Sahel; solar radiation is absorbed by plants to provide energy for photosynthesis, while moisture shortfalls control the efficiency of light usage. In particular, we show how an economical use of existing, yet meagre data sets can be used to circumvent nominal, yet untenable approaches for achieving this for the region. Specifically, we use a cloudiness layer provided with the NOAA/NASA 8 km Pathfinder Land data archive (PAL) data set to derive solar radiation (and other energy balance terms) required to implement the model (monthly time-step). Of particular note, we index growth efficiency via transpiration by subsuming rangeland-yield formulations into our model. This is important for partially vegetated landscapes where the fate of rainfall is controlled by relative vegetation cover. We accomplish this by using PAL-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to partition the landscape into fractional vegetation cover. A bare soil evaporation model that <b>feeds</b> into <b>bucket</b> model is then applied, thereafter deriving actual transpiration (quasi-daily time-step). We forgo a formal validation of the model due to problems of spatial scale and data limitations. Instead, we generate maps showing model robustness via Monte Carlo simulation. The precision of our Gross Primary Production (GPP) estimates is acceptable, but falls off rapidly for the northern fringes of the Sahel. We also map the locations where errors in the driving variables are mostly responsible for the bulk of uncertainty in predicted GPP, in this case the water stress factor and the NDVI. Comparisons with an independent model of primary production, CENTURY, are relatively poor, yet favourable comparisons are made with previous primary production estimates found for the region in the literature. A spatially exhaustive evaluation of our GPP map is carried out by regressing randomly sampled observations against integrated NDVI, a method traditionally used to quantify absolute amounts of primary production. Our model can be used to quantify stocks and flows of carbon in grasslands over the recent historical period. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Producers included in the study each had herds of 30 or more milk cows, representing 78 percent of the milk cows in the U. S. The average total of cattle and calves on each operation was 169. 4. The main breed on 94. 9 % of operations was Holstein. Slightly over 46 percent of operations stated reproductive problems as the cause of low milk production of cows culled from the herd. Newborn calves were separated from their mothers before nursing on 28. 0 percent of operations and less than 12 hours after birth on 39. 6 percent of operations. On 64. 0 percent of operations, calves received their first feeding of colostrum via hand <b>feeding</b> from a <b>bucket</b> or bottle. Of operations using hand feeding, 94. 6 % fed first milk from the mother (as opposed to other colostrum or substitute) to calves. Calves received, on average, between two and four quarts of colostrum during the first 24 hours. A variety of liquid feeds were used after colostrum was fed; the two most widely utilized were milk replacer (59. 0 percent of operations) and milk from cows recently calved (51. 9 percent of operations). Calves were weaned from liquid ration at an average age of 7. 9 weeks. The average age of heifers at first calving was 25. 9 months. The most common illness among dairy heifer calves was scours (53. 8 percent of operations), with respiratory problems as the second most common illness (12. 1 percent of operations). Scours was estimated to cause 52. 2 percent of deaths (4. 4 percent of calves born) among dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning; respiratory problems were estimated to cause 34. 8 percent of deaths (0. 8 percent of heifer inventory) among heifers from weaning age to first calving.

MaghirangThe United States grain {{handling}} {{infrastructure is}} facing major challenges to meet worldwide customer demands for wholesome, quality, and safe grains and oilseeds {{for food and}} feed. Several challenges are maintaining grain quality during handling; reducing dust emissions for safety and health issues; growing shift from commodity-based to specialty (trait-specific) markets; proliferation of genetically modified crops for food, feed, fuel, pharmaceutical, and industrial uses; and threats from biological and chemical attacks. This {{study was conducted to}} characterize the quality of grain and <b>feed</b> during <b>bucket</b> elevator handling to meet customer demand for high quality and safe products. Specific objectives were to (1) determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of feed pellets and corn; (2) characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling; (3) develop and evaluate particle models for simulating the flow of grain during elevator handling; and (4) accurately simulate grain commingling in elevator boots with discrete element method (DEM). Experiments were conducted at the research elevator of the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR) to determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of corn-based feed pellets and corn. Repeated handling did not significantly influence the durability indices of feed pellets and corn. The feed pellets, however, had significantly greater breakage (3. 83 % per transfer) than the corn (0. 382 % per transfer). The mass of particulate matter < 125 Î¼m was less for feed pellets than for corn. These corn-based feed pellets can be an alternative to corn in view of their handling characteristics. Another series of experiments was conducted in the same elevator to characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling. Dust samples were collected from the lower and upper ducts upstream of the cyclones in the elevator. Handling corn produced {{more than twice as much}} total dust than handling wheat (185 g/t vs. 64. 6 g/t). Analysis of dust samples with a laser diffraction analyzer showed that the corn samples produced smaller dust particles, and a greater proportion of small particles, than the wheat samples. Published data on material and interaction properties of selected grains and oilseeds that are relevant to DEM modeling were reviewed. Using these material and interaction properties and soybeans as the test material, the DEM fundamentals were validated by modeling the flow of soybean during handling with a commercial software package (EDEM). Soybean kernels were simulated with single- and multi-sphere particle shapes. A single-sphere particle model best simulated soybean kernels in the bulk property tests. The best particle model had a particle coefficient of restitution of 0. 6; particle static friction of 0. 45 for soybean-soybean contact (0. 30 for soybean-steel interaction); particle rolling friction of 0. 05; normal particle size distribution with standard deviation factor of 0. 4; and particle shear modulus of 1. 04 MPa. The single-sphere particle model for soybeans was implemented in EDEM to simulate grain commingling in a pilot-scale bucket elevator boot using 3 D and quasi- 2 D models. Pilot-scale boot experiments of soybean commingling were performed to validate these models. Commingling was initially simulated with a full 3 D model. Of the four quasi- 2 D boot models with reduced control volumes (4 d, 5 d, 6 d, and 7 d; i. e., control volume widths from 4 to 7 times the mean particle diameter) considered, the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model predictions best matched those of the initial 3 D model. Introduction of realistic vibration motion during the onset of clear soybeans improved the prediction capability of the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model. The physics of the model was refined by accounting for the initial surge of particles and reducing the gap between the bucket cups and the boot wall. Inclusion of the particle surge flow and reduced gap gave the best predictions of commingling of all the tested models. This study showed that grain commingling in a bucket elevator boot system can be simulated in 3 D and quasi- 2 D DEM models and gave results that generally agreed with experimental data. The quasi- 2 D (6 d) models reduced simulation run time by 29 % compared to the 3 D model. Results of this study will be used to accurately predict impurity levels and improve grain handling, which can help farmers and grain handlers reduce costs during transport and export of grains and make the U. S. grain more competitive in the world market...|$|R
40|$|On {{dairy farms}} the {{tradition}} are {{to take the}} calf away from its mother directly after birth and <b>bucket</b> <b>feed</b> it. This model often leads to abnormal behaviours of the calves. To make the environment for the animals better {{and to ensure that}} the consumers get a product that is produced in an ethical way, the calves could be allowed to suckle. This work includes a summary of literature that deals with natural behaviour of cattle and effects of allowing the calf to suckle. It also includes own studies made on EkenÃ¤s ecological farm, near Flen, where they allowed the dairy calves suckle. The calves suckle their own dam for the first three weeks and thereafter unfamiliar cows up to ten weeks of age. The studies were made during the autumn 1995. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe how the cows and calves behaved in this system and its effects on growth, udder health and milk production, identify problems and suggest changes. Behavioural observations were made on six calves and their damd during the first and the 12 :th day after they were moved from their individual calving pen to the early lacting cow group (HG) in the uninsolated barn. After three weeks together with their own dam in the HG the calve was separated from its mother and moved to a group of cows that were in the end of their lactation (LG). The calves were studied the first and 7 :th day in this group. The calves were weighed regularly and their mothers were control milked during the period. In HG almost every suckling was in the opposite parallel position. They suckled on average 6, 25 times/ 19 h and each suckling bout lasted on average 6, 4 min. In HG the dam initiated more suckling bouts than did the calf but the calves terminated more suckling bouts. In LG the calves suckled 9, 8 times/ 19 h and the calves initiated all of the suckling bouts. When the suckling bout ended it was difficult to see if it was the aggression of the cow that finally got the intended effect or if the calf was satisfied The number of attempts (initiations that never led to a suckling bout) was higher in LG than in HG and more of them ended because of the cows aggressive behaviour against the calf. In HG there was only one cross-suckling (the calf suckled an alien cow) and that lasted only for 4 minutes. In LG the calves suckled on several cows. The cows produced on average 11, 1 l/ day when the calves were together with them and suckled and 19, 5 l/day after the separation. The daily weight gain of the calves was 627 g in HG and 854 g in LG. The conclusions of the study is that it was peaceful in HG but very restless in LG therfore it is suggested to have all lactating cows in one group resulting in that the calves can suckle the dam until weaning. In this way there would be less transfer of animals, more peaceful groups and less disturbed suckling bouts...|$|R

Average daily gain for this category was 474 g/d in the Â¼, 510 g/d in the Â½ and from 575 to 610 g/d in the other four groups, with a linear trend on HVB gene fraction (gI = 0, 171 Â± 0, 065 g/d), attributed to the observed fact that the calves with higher Bos indicus fraction did not adapt well to <b>bucket</b> <b>feeding.</b> This lower growth rate was compensated as heifers, category in which the F 1 displayed the highest daily weight gain (371 g/d), which decreased from 309 g/d in the Â¼ to 256 g/d in the > 31 / 32 HVB. The additive-dominant model adequately fitted the daily gains in F 1 and backcross heifers, {{but not in the}} 5 / 8 inter se cross, suggesting the a presence of epistasis. Excluding this last group, estimates were gI = - 0, 006 Â± 0, 023 and hI = 0, 113 Â± 0, 020 g/d...|$|R
