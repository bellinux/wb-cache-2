Two formulations of slow release fertilizer were prepared namely the Leonardite and Zeolite slow release fertilizer and the Leonardite slow release fertilizer. Theirnutrient releasing rates were investigated and comparedwith {{that of the}} commercially availableslow release fertilizer which contained N 8 :P 24 :K 24. Specifically the slow release fertilizers were formulated from leonardite, zeolite and other fertilizer materials such as ammonium phosphate and potassium chloride. Each formulation was then pelletized and baked at 100 °C for 1 hr to remove water; then they were kilned at 150 °C for 1 hr. All the kilned fertilizers were analyzed subsequently by using the <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>Test</b> Kit (KU. 5) to determine the releasing rates of the main N, P and K nutrients. Each fertilizer was immersed in distilled water and shakenat the speed of 150 rpm for 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr and 2 hr. The nutrients released into the distilled water were determined following the standard methodology. The {{results indicated that the}} nutrient releasing rates of the slow release fertilizer prepared from Leonardite and Zeolite were less than those observed in the commercial fertilizer...|$|E

Nitrogen {{availability}} during grain-filling may restrict grain protein accumulation, particularly in high yielding environments. Slow-release fertilizers could potentially sustain nitrogen availability during the grain-filling period. The {{aim of this study}} was to increase plant nitrogen uptake, grain yield and grain protein response of spring wheat cultivar ‘Amaretto’, using combinations of a regular and slow-release compound NPK fertilizer. Fertilizer treatment effects on grain yield was modest, however, slow-release fertilizer treatments lowered grain protein content as well as grain, straw and total plant N compared with control treatment. The total plant N was 10 to 27 kg ha- 1 lower following application of slow-release fertilizer.

Observations of many investigators {{as well as}} the results of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>tests</b> have pointed out the extra-ordinarily high nitrogen requirement of grasses for optimum yields, especially bromegrass. A comprehensive study was done about the influence of rate and time of applications of different nitrogenous fertilizers on the intake of nitrogen by bromegrass. This experiment was conducted to compare applications of anhydrous ammonia with applications of other nitrogen fertilizers as to their effects on yield and composition of bromegrass. Very large increases in yield of forage were obtained with each fertilizer, and significant increases were obtained with each added increment of nitrogen compared to unfertilized forage.

40|$|Uniform Rate of {{fertilizer}} Application (URA) practice is disregarding the productive {{potential of the}} various areas within the field. Thus, some area is less fertilized and other is over fertilized. It {{is also an important}} issue recently that nitrogen from fertilizers may be subjected to lost into atmosphere or enters streams through surface or subsurface drainage (leaching).

Biochars were produced from two different feedstocks (dairy manure-wood mixture, MAe; biosolid-wood mixture, BSe) at four different pyrolysis temperatures (250, 350, 450, and 550 A degrees C). Results showed that P in feedstock was fully recovered in the biochars.

Each treatment was composed of 16 plants at a distance planting of 20 cmx 40 cm between hills and rows respectively. Application of fertilizer was done basal and harvesting was conducted twice starting from 30 days and 34 days. With the three treatments compared, effect of fertilizer applied was measured in terms of plant height, leaf area length, weight of marketable leaves, weight of marketable plant, number of leaves per plant and the leaf area infestation. Consistent result, except for leaf area pest infestation showed that those plants applied with vermicompost manifested the highest mean.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} on a sandy soil in Niger to evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of various P fertilizers for millet production during 1985 to 1987. The P <b>fertilizers</b> <b>tested</b> were two finely ground phosphate rocks (PR) indigenous to Niger (Tahoua and Parc W rocks), PR partially acidulated with H 2 SO 4 at 50 % acidulation level (PAPR), single superphosphate (SSP), and triple superphosphate (TSP). In 1985, application rates were 0, 6. 5, 13. 0, and 19. 5 kg P ha− 1 {{for each of the}} P fertilizers. In 1986, half of the plots received the same rates of P as in 1985 and half of the plots received no additional P. In 1987, P additions were repeated only in half of the plots that received P during 1986. A significant (P = 0. 05) millet response to P was observed in all the trials. The major findings of this study were: (i) finely ground Tahoua PR was more effective than Parc W PR because of its higher reactivity and was 82 to 91 % as effective as SSP for millet production in both the initial and two subsequent seasons; (ii) partial acidulation of Parc W PR can significantly increase its agronomic effectiveness in the first year, but not in terms of residual effect; (iii) partial acidulation was not a desirable technology for increasing the effectiveness of Tahoua PR, because its high Fe 2 O 3 plus Al 2 O 3 content resulted in a product containing relatively low amounts of water-soluble P; and (iv) over a period of 3 yr, one initial application of a large dose of P fertilizer was found to be more effective than three small annual applications in terms of total grain productio...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that slag-based silicon fertilizers have beneficial effects on the growth and disease resistance of rice.

To date, few researches have been done to compare the differences in plant performance and disease resistance between different slag-based silicon fertilizers applied at the same rate of plant-available Si. In the present study both steel and iron slags were chosen to investigate their effects on rice growth and disease resistance under greenhouse conditions. Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used {{to examine the effects of}} slags on ultrastructural changes in leaves of rice naturally infected by Bipolaris oryaze, the causal agent of brown spot. The results showed that both slag-based Si <b>fertilizers</b> <b>tested</b> significantly increased rice growth and yield, but decreased brown spot incidence, with steel slag showing a stronger effect than iron slag. The results of SEM analysis showed that application of slags led to more pronounced cell silicification in rice leaves, more silica cells, and more pronounced and larger papilla as well. The results of TEM analysis showed that mesophyll cells of slag-untreated rice leaf were disorganized, with colonization of the fungus (Bipolaris oryzae), including chloroplast degradation and cell wall alterations. The application of slag maintained mesophyll cells relatively intact and increased the thickness of silicon layer. It can be concluded that applying slag-based fertilizer to Si-deficient paddy soil is necessary for improving both rice productivity and brown spot resistance. The immobile silicon deposited in host cell walls and papillae sites is the first physical barrier for fungal penetration, while the soluble Si in the cytoplasm enhances physiological or induced resistance to fungal colonization...|$|R

Laurina called 'Bourbon Pointu', {{and set out to}} determine growing practices and post-harvest treatments enabling the production of an inimitable coffee. The project involved the development of 106 experimental cultivation plots. The first phase of the project, from 2002 to 2007, was used to establish technical/commercial references for the production and processing of high added-value "grands crus" coffees. Soils were characterized and farms potentially suitable for the production of quality coffee were identified. Over that period more than 1126 samples were collected and analysed in diffuse reflectance from 1100 nm to 2500 nm using a NIRSystem FOSS 5000 spectrometer (Port Matilda, USA). In that way, a Near Infrared (NIR) spectral database specific to Bourbon Pointu (BP) coffees was compiled. A principal components analysis was performed on the spectral database in order to calculate Mahalanobis distances from the average spectrum for each spectrum and then fix boundaries for the population. Based on these results, samples differing from pure BP, such as "Bourbon rond", were removed from the database. The database was constructed by removing samples corresponding to abandoned trials such as certain post-harvest treatments or <b>fertilizer</b> <b>tests.</b> This led to a specific database for BP comprising 670 spectra of green coffees. From that collection, 250 random samples were analysed at the CIRAD laboratories, using reference methods, for their caffeine, chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, fat, sucrose and moisture contents. Those values were added to CIRAD¿s Arabica NIR database to develop specific calibration for BP coffees using Partial Least Squares Regression. This approach revealed {{that it was possible to}} authenticate BP coffee from Réunion using NIRS fingerprinting. The calibrations developed in this study made it possible to quantify the content of 6 major quality-related chemical compounds in BP green coffee. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|One typical {{symptom of}} crop {{damage caused by}} {{fertilizer}} is the occurrence of tipburn. In general, lettuce is cultivated at low temperatures and low-light conditions to inhibit tipburn caused by a calcium disorder. Tipburn should be avoided because it significantly reduces the salability of the crop [24, 25]. Therefore, to investigate the chemical damage caused by the <b>test</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> the number of tipburns per transplanted seedling was counted at the 13 th day after transplanting. Considerable (29 %) tipburn damage was observed in the groups treated with high-concentration (diluted 1 / 500) r-Ringer, but not in any concentrations of AGH-Ringer or conventional treatments (data not shown). While tipburn is generally considered a calcium deficiency problem, symptoms may appear despite sufficient calcium supply in the soil. The problem lies in the plant’s inability to move sufficient calcium to the leaves rapidly. Calcium moves from the root to {{the leaves of the}} plant with water drawn by the transpiration process. These results suggest that the reason for the lack of tipburn in the AGH-Ringer treated group is that calcium movement is facilitated by a vitamin C–calcium complex. This means that the <b>test</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is safe for plant growth as it does not cause chemical damage.|$|R

40|$|Low-cost {{methods are}} needed to enhance various {{bioremediation}} technologies, from natural attenuation to heavily engineered remediation of subsurface hydrocarbon contamination. Many subsurface sites have insufficient quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus, resulting in poor bioactivity and increased remediation time and costs. The addition of conventional fertilizers can improve bioactivity, but often the nutrients dissolve quickly and migrate away from the contaminant zone before being utilized by the microbes. Through this project, conducted by the Energy & Environmental Research Center, polymers were developed that slowly release nitrogen and phosphorus into the subsurface. Conceptually, these polymers are designed to adhere to soil particles in the subsurface contamination zone where they slowly degrade and release nutrients over {{longer periods of time}} compared to conventional <b>fertilizer</b> applications. <b>Tests</b> conducted during this study indicate that some of the developed polymers have excellent potential to satisfy the microbial requirements for enhanced bioremediation...|$|R
30|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to combine the Pheroid technology with FeSO 4 or nanostructured FePO 4 to develop a novel foliar Fe <b>fertilizer,</b> and to <b>test</b> it for enhancement of seed Fe concentrations in soybeans compared with commonly used foliar fertilizers like FeSO 4 and FeSO 4 with citrate. The results obtained showed that none of the formulations caused any change in soybean seed Fe, Zn, P, PA, and protein concentrations. The cause for this could either come from the formulation of the treatment, or from the chosen crop.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} analyses long-run and short-run co-movements {{among the}} three variables “international prices,” “domestic prices, ” and “import prices ” of phosphate <b>fertilizers</b> using co-integration <b>test,</b> Granger causality test, and VEC model. The findings revealed that the domestic phosphate fertilizer market in Vietnam has well integrated into the international phosphate market since shifts in the domestic phosphate fertilizer price have been in long-run equilibrium {{with those in the}} international phosphate fertilizer price. Furthermore, changes in the domestic phosphate fertilizer price were brisker than those in the import price and were uncorrelated with the import prices...|$|R
30|$|Transcriptional {{profiling}} {{has identified}} genes associated with adaptive responses to phosphorus (P) deficiency; however, distinguishing stress response from tolerance has been difficult. We report gene expression patterns in two rice genotypes (Nipponbare and NIL 6 - 4 which carries a major QTL for P deficiency tolerance (Pup 1)) grown in soil with/without P <b>fertilizer.</b> We <b>tested</b> the hypotheses that tolerance of NIL 6 - 4 {{is associated with}} (1) internal P remobilization/redistribution; (2) enhanced P solubilization and/or acquisition; and (3) root growth modifications that maximize P interception. Genes responding to P supply far exceeded those differing between genotypes. Genes associated with internal P remobilization/redistribution and soil P solubilization/uptake were stress responsive but often more so in intolerant Nipponbare. However, genes putatively associated with root cell wall loosening and root hair extension (xyloglucan endotransglycosylases/hydrolases and NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase) showed higher expression in roots of tolerant NIL 6 - 4. This was supported by phenotypic data showing higher root biomass and hair length in NIL 6 - 4.|$|R
40|$|Organic farming {{requires}} {{the use of}} practices such as crop rotation, green manure and compost application instead of chemical compounds to enhance farm productivity. In this study, effects of two pre-crops (vetch-wheat mixture and broccoli) and additional fertilization (AF) strategy (compost and commercial <b>fertilizer)</b> were <b>tested</b> on organic production of two main crops (tomato and zucchini) and on soil fertility. The main aim of this on-farm trial is to evaluate the applicability of the results obtained over four years study under experimental conditions. Pre-crops and AF strategy had no significant effect on zucchini yield; highest tomato yield was recorded after vetch-wheat mixture and AF. At the end of the cycle soil organic matter statistically increased in vetch-wheat mixture with AF plots. Soil nitrogen (N) levels increased slightly in all treatments but this increase was not significantly different from the initial level of N. Vetch-wheat mixture and tomato rotation with AF provided the highest gross-margin due to a higher yield...|$|R
40|$|Antherura rubra Lour {{is one of}} the {{critical}} plant at Cibodas Botanical Garden. Study of cultivation through vegetative propagation of A. Rubra is rare. Therefore, the research of A. rubra on various of media and inorganic fertilizers is required to conserve A. rubra at Cibodas Botanical Garden. This study was conducted at the Nursery - Cibodas Botanic Garden for 10 months. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design (RBD) with four replications. Treatments consisted of three combinations of natural compost media with three levels of inorganic fertilizer (0, 1 g/L, and 2 g/L), three katalek compost combination with three levels of inorganic fertilizer and a control (top soil without inorganic <b>fertilizers).</b> Variable <b>tested</b> consists of plant height, number of leaves, and dry weight shoot and root as an indicator of growth A. rubra Lour The results showed that the growth of seedlings A. rubra Lour on katalek compost media's with one dose of levels inorganic fertilizer growth better than other treatments...|$|R
