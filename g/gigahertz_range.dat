50|$|Negative {{magnetic}} permeability was originally achieved in a left-handed medium at microwave frequencies by using arrays of split-ring resonators. In most natural materials, the magnetically coupled response starts to taper off at frequencies in the <b>gigahertz</b> <b>range,</b> which implies that significant magnetism {{does not occur}} at optical frequencies. The effective permeability of such materials is unity, μeff = 1.

50|$|Finding {{materials}} that stimulate emission {{was needed for}} the development of the SASER. The generation of coherent phonons in a double-barrier semiconductor heterostructure was first proposed around 1990. The transformation of the electric potential energy in a vibrational mode of the lattice is remarkably facilitated by the electronic confinement in a double-barrier structure. On this basis, physicists were searching for materials in which stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission, is the dominant decay process. A device was first experimentally demonstrated in the <b>Gigahertz</b> <b>range</b> in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes true {{point-to-point}} wiring—without terminal strips—with {{very short}} connections, is used {{at very high}} radio frequencies (in the <b>gigahertz</b> <b>range)</b> to minimise stray capacitance and inductance; the capacitance between a circuit-board trace and some other conductor, and the inductance of a short track, become significant or dominant at high frequencies. In some cases careful PCB layout on a substrate with good high-frequency properties (e.g., ceramic) is sufficient.

50|$|The {{proposed}} structures {{go beyond}} the wire/SRR composites in {{that they do not}} rely on SRRs to synthesize the material parameters, thus leading to dramatically increased operating bandwidths. Moreover, their unit cells are connected through a transmission-line network and they may, therefore, be equipped with lumped elements, which permit them to be compact at frequencies where the SRR cannot be compact. The flexibility gained through the use of either discrete or printed elements enables planar metamaterials to be scalable from the megahertz to the tens of <b>gigahertz</b> <b>range.</b> In addition, by utilizing varactors instead of capacitors, the effective material properties can be dynamically tuned. Furthermore, the proposed media are planar and inherently support two-dimensional (2-D) wave propagation.

50|$|As briefly {{mentioned}} above, {{naturally occurring}} {{materials such as}} conventional lenses and glass prisms are unable to significantly interact with the magnetic field of light. The significant interaction (permittivity) occurs with the electric field. In natural materials, any useful magnetic interaction will taper off in the <b>gigahertz</b> <b>range</b> of frequencies. Compared to interaction with the electric field, the magnetic component is imperceptible when in terahertz, infrared, and visible light. So, a notable step occurred with the invention of a practical metamaterial at microwave frequencies, because the rudimentary elements of metamaterials have demonstrated a coupling and inductive response to the magnetic component commensurate with the electric coupling and response. This demonstrated the occurrence of an artificial magnetism, and was later applied to terahertz and infrared electromagnetic wave (or light). In the terahertz and infrared domain, it is a response {{that has not been}} discovered in nature.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper reviews {{experimental}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) and computational molecular dynamics (MD) investigations of the structural and dynamical behavior of cations, anions, H 2 O, and CO 2 on the surfaces and in the interlayer galleries of layer-structure minerals and their composites with polymers and natural organic matter (NOM). The interaction among mineral surfaces, charge-balancing cations or anions, H 2 O, CO 2, and NOM are dominated by Coulombic, H-bond, and van der Waals interactions leading to statically and dynamically disordered systems and molecular-scale processes with characteristic room-temperature frequencies varying from at least as small as 10 (2) to > 10 (12) Hz. NMR spectroscopy provides local structural information about such systems through the chemical shift and quadrupolar interactions and dynamical information at frequencies from the sub-kilohertz to <b>gigahertz</b> <b>ranges</b> through the T- 1 and T- 2 relaxation rates and line shape analysis. It {{is often difficult to}} associate a specific structure or dynamical process to a given NMR observation, however, and computational molecular modeling is often effective in providing a much more detailed picture in this regard.
