50|$|In 1858 he {{described}} the Griess <b>diazotization</b> reaction which would {{form the basis for}} the Griess test for detection of Nitrite. Most of his work related to brewing remained confidential, but his additional work on organic chemistry was published by him in several articles.|$|E
50|$|Roxarsone is a {{derivative}} of phenylarsonic acid (C6H5As(O)(OH)2). It was first {{reported in a}} 1923 British patent that described the nitration and <b>diazotization</b> of arsanilic acid. When blended with calcite powder, it is used in poultry feed premixes and is usually available in 5%, 20% and 50% concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Iodobenzoic acid, or o-iodobenzoic acid, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula IC6H4COOH. The synthesis of 2-iodobenzoic acid via the <b>diazotization</b> of anthranilic acid is commonly performed in university organic chemistry labs. One {{of its most}} common uses is as a precursor for the preparation of IBX and Dess-Martin periodinane, both used as mild oxidants.|$|E
50|$|A Sandmeyer {{reaction}} by <b>diazotization</b> of 2-(4-aminophenyl)propanenitrile (1) {{followed by}} acid hydrolysis leads to phenol (2), which undergoes nitration and reduction to give aminophenol (3). Hydrolysis of the nitrile and esterification produces ester 4, which {{is converted to}} benoxaprofen (5) by acylation with p-chlorobenzoyl chloride, followed by cyclization and then by saponification of the ethyl ester.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Iodobenzoic acid can be {{synthesized}} via a Sandmeyer reaction {{consisting of}} the <b>diazotization</b> of anthranilic acid followed by a diazo replacement. First anthranilic acid is treated with nitrous acid in order to convert the amino group into the diazo group. The diazo group is ejected, yielding a carbocation which is then attacked by highly nucleophilic I− anion.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} the azide moiety is sodium azide. As a pseudohalogen compound, sodium azide generally displaces an appropriate leaving group (e.g., Br, I, OTs) to give the azido compound. Aryl azides may be prepared by displacement of the appropriate diazonium salt with sodium azide, or trimethylsilyl azide; nucleophilic aromatic substitution is also possible, even with chlorides. Anilines and aromatic hydrazines undergo <b>diazotization,</b> as do alkyl amines and hydrazines.|$|E
50|$|Several peri-naphthalenes are {{prepared}} via nitrations. Dinitration of naphthalene gives 1,8-dinitronaphthalene, which undergoes hydrogenation to the diamine. The diamine {{can also be}} produced by reaction of the 1,8-diol with ammonia at high temperatures. The peri-naphthalene 1-amino-naphthalene-8-sulfonic acid is a precursor to other peri-naphthalenes. It is prepared by nitration of naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid followed by reduction. <b>Diazotization</b> followed by loss of N2 gives the naphthosultone. This species reacts with NaOH to give sequentially 1-hydroxynaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid and then the 1,8-diol.|$|E
50|$|The Griess test is an {{analytical}} chemistry test which detects {{the presence of}} nitrite ion in solution. One of its most important uses is the determination of nitrite in drinking water. The test has also been widely used {{for the detection of}} trace explosives containing nitro groups. It is usually necessary to release the nitrite ion from the organic explosive before analysis. This is normally done by alkaline hydrolysis. The Griess <b>diazotization</b> reaction on which the Griess reagent relies was first described in 1858 by Peter Griess.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Bromopyridine is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula BrC5H4N. It is a colorless liquid {{that is used}} as an intermediate in organic synthesis. It can be prepared from 2-aminopyridine via <b>diazotization</b> followed by bromination. [...] It reacts with butyllithium to give 2-lithiopyridine, a versatile reagent. [...] Pyrithione can be prepared in a two-step synthesis from 2-bromopyridine by oxidation to the N-oxide with a suitable peracid followed by substitution using either sodium dithionite or sodium sulfide with sodium hydroxide to introduce the thiol functional group.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{process begins}} with <b>diazotization</b> of the amine by nitrous acid. The diazonium {{group is a}} good leaving group, forming nitrogen gas when displaced from the organic structure. This displacement can occur via a rearrangement (path A), in {{which one of the}} sigma bonds adjacent to the diazo group migrates. This migration results in an expansion of the ring. The resulting carbocation is then attacked by a molecule of water. Alternately, the diazo group can be displaced directly by a molecule of water in an SN2 reaction (path B). Both routes lead to formation of an alcohol.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{rim of the}} cyclooctane B ring {{containing}} the first 5 carbon atoms was synthesized in a semisynthesis starting from naturally occurring L-serine (scheme 1). This route started with conversion of the amino group of the serine methyl ester (1) to the diol ester 2 via <b>diazotization</b> (sodium nitrite/sulfuric acid). After protection of the primary alcohol group to a (t-butyldimethyl) TBS silyl ether (TBSCl / imidazole) {{and that of the}} secondary alcohol group with a (Bn) benzyl ether (benzyl imidate, triflic acid), the aldehyde 3 was reacted with the methyl ester of isobutyric acid (4) in an Aldol addition to alcohol 5 with 65% stereoselectivity. This group was protected as a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) ether (again through an imidate) in 6 which enabled organic reduction of the ester to the aldehyde in 7 with DIBAL.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this thin slurry. After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the <b>diazotization</b> reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small periodic charges, smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. Under nitrogen atmosphere the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a <b>diazotization</b> reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure azinphos-methyl in form of white crystals.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{synthesis}} of Sudan I is the formation of a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine, which is called <b>diazotization.</b> In most cases this is done by reacting a primary amine like aniline with nitrous acid, which is made in situ from sodium nitrite {{in the presence of a}} strong inorganic acid like hydrochloric acid. Diazonium salts formed from primary aliphatic amines are too unstable and will spontaneously decompose in nitrogen gas and a carbocation that will react further to form alkenes, alkyl halides, and alcohols, with alcohols as the major product.The strong acid protonates one of the oxygen atoms to form nitrous acid (1), after which it is protonated again making the hydroxyl group a good leaving group to split off as water. The remaining part is a nitric oxide cation (2).The amine group on aniline then performs a nucleophilic attack on the nitrogen atom of the nitric oxide cation (3). The oxygen on the nitrosamine group is protonated twice (4), making it a good leaving group to split off as water(5), after which the benzene diazonium salt is formed (6). It is important to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture below 5 ˚C, otherwise the diazonium salt will become too unstable and spontaneously decompose as described earlier.The second step in the synthesis of Sudan I is the azo coupling. Firstly, 2-naphthol is activated under alkaline condition to form 2-naphtholate (7). The acidic mixture with the diazonium salt is then added, which leads to a nucleophilic attack by 2-naphthanolate on the diazonium ion (8). Because the reaction mixture is now acidic, the oxygen atom gets protonated which leads to the elimination of the hydrogen atom bonded on the α position, which results in the formation of the Sudan I dye (9).|$|E
40|$|The solid-solid {{reactions}} of some electron-donors with sulfanilic acid {{in the presence}} of solid sodium nitrite afford azo dyes by self-catalyzed <b>diazotization</b> of sulfanilic acid (2) under solvent-free conditions with moderate yields. Also the {{reactions of}} some electron-donors with <b>diazotization</b> of o-nitroaniline (5), m-nitroaniline (6) and p-nitroaniline (7) {{in the presence of}} solid sodium nitrite catalyzed by p-toluenesul-fonic acid (PTSA) afford azo dyes under solvent-free conditions in good yields. This new method totally avoids the use of acids, alkalies, and toxic and/or expensive solvents in <b>diazotization</b> and diazo coupling reactions...|$|E
30|$|The nitrite and nitrate (NOx) {{concentration}} {{was determined}} by simple Griess reaction (Guevara et al. 1998). Briefly the assay consists of two steps: <b>diazotization</b> of sulphanilic acid with nitrite ion and coupling of this product with diamine, which results in a measurable pink metabolite that measured at 540  nm. Before <b>diazotization</b> reaction, all nitrate ions present in tissue were converted to nitrite ions {{by the action of}} NADPH-dependent nitrate reductase.|$|E

3000|$|Further, the {{construction}} triazole ring on 15 to provide 16 comprises <b>diazotization</b> reaction followed by cyclization. The reported reactions for <b>diazotization</b> (NaNO 2 -acetic acid) involve highly acidic {{conditions that are}} found to be not suitable as it leads to deprotection compound 15 and formation of other unknown impurities which are difficult to remove. The alternative diazotizing agents such as alkyl nitrite (isoamyl nitrite in bromoform) is not suitable for <b>diazotization</b> on an industrial scale, since they are expensive, decompose during storage, corrosive and requires exclusively organic medium (ether, acetonitrile, THF, etc.,). Diazonium salts obtained under classical conditions are potentially explosive substances and thus need a very safer mechanism to handle in the plant scale. <b>Diazotization</b> using cation exchange resin along with mild acidic reagent such as P-toluene sulphonicacid (TsOH) with sodium nitrite in acetonitrile and water mixture releases brown fumes of gaseous nitrogen oxide which is again not safe in the production environment (Filimonov et al. 2008; Gorlushko et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2010; Moon et al. 2010).
