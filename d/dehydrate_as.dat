40|$|Background: Many rapidly {{developing}} systems rely on {{the regulated}} translation of stored transcripts {{for the formation of}} new proteins essential for morphogenesis. The microspores of the water fern Marsilea vestita <b>dehydrate</b> <b>as</b> they mature. During this process both mRNA and proteins required for subsequent development are stored within the microspores as they become fully desiccated and enter into senescence. At this point microspores become transcriptionally silent and remain so upon rehydration and for the remainder of spermatogenesis. Transcriptional silencing coupled with the translation of preformed RNA makes the microspore of M. vestita a useful system in which to study post-transcriptional regulation of RNA. Results: We have characterized the distribution of mRNA as well as several conserved markers of subnuclear bodies within the nuclei of desiccating spores. During this period, nuclear speckles containing RNA were seen to aggregate forming a single large coalescence. We found that aggregated speckles contain several masked mRNA species known to be essential for spermatogenesis. During spermatogenesis masked mRNA and associated speckle proteins were shown to fragment and asymmetrically localize to spermatogenous but not sterile cells. This asymmetric localization was disrupted by RNAi knockdown of the Marsilea homolog of the Exon Junction Complex core component Mago nashi. Conclusions: A subset of masked mRNA is stored in association with nuclear speckles during the dormant phase of microspore development in M. vestita. The asymmetric distribution of specific mRNAs to spermatogenous but not sterile cells mirrors their translational activities and appears to require the EJC or EJC components. This suggests a novel role for nuclear speckles in the post-transcriptional regulation of transcripts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The thermal {{behavior}} of a poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) aqueous solution (30 wt%) during a heating-and-cooling cycle is studied using FTIR spectroscopy in combination with 2 D correlation analysis. The FTIR spectral data of O-H, CH 3 -O, and C-H stretching vibration regions provide detailed changes of hydrophilic and hydro-phobic groups of PVME. Hydrogen bonds between hydro-philic groups and water and hydration interactions between hydrophobic groups and water are confirmed to be completely reversible in the heating-and-cooling cycle. Two-dimensional correlation method helps us to understand the microdynamics mechanism of phase separation {{behavior of}} PVME 30 wt % aqueous solution. During the heating process, the initially hydrated CH 3 groups start to <b>dehydrate</b> <b>as</b> the first action of phase separation, and the initially hydrated CH 2 groups follow to start their dehydration; interestingly, water molecules leave CH 2 groups very fast, and the whole dehydration process of CH 2 groups finishes even earlier than that of CH 3. After hydrophobic groups finish their dehydrations, hydrogen bonds between hydrophilic group and water start to dissociate. 1 : 2 adducts formed between PVME and water dissociate first and transfer to the 1 : 1 adducts, whereas with further heating, 1 : 1 adducts eventually dissociate and release free water and free CH 3 -O. PCMW method is used as supplement to determine changing conditions of various chemical structures. During the phase separation, O-H hydrogen bond in 1 : 2 adduct is found to dissociate between 35. 5 and 39 C in a style, whereas the 1 : 1 adduct (also considered as free water) increases between 35. 5 and 39 C in a style.

40|$|Hydrogel {{polymers}} {{are used}} for the manufacture of soft (or disposable) contact lenses worldwide today, but {{have a tendency to}} dehydrate on the eye. In vitro methods that can probe the potential for a given hydrogel polymer to dehydrate in vivo are much sought after. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) {{has been shown to be}} effective in characterising water mobility and binding in similar systems (Barbieri, Quaglia et al., 1998, Larsen, Huff et al., 1990, Peschier, Bouwstra et al., 1993), predominantly through measurement of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1), the spinspin relaxation time (T 2) and the water diffusion coefficient (D). The aim of this work was to use NMR to quantify the molecular behaviour of water in a series of commercially available contact lens hydrogels, and relate these measurements to the binding and mobility of the water, and ultimately the potential for the hydrogel to <b>dehydrate.</b> <b>As</b> a preliminary study, in vitro evaporation rates were measured for a set of commercial contact lens hydrogels. Following this, comprehensive measurement of the temperature and water content dependencies of T 1, T 2 and D was performed for a series of commercial hydrogels that spanned the spectrum of equilibrium water content (EWC) and common compositions of contact lenses that are manufactured today. To quantify material differences, the data were then modelled based on theory that had been used for similar systems in the literature (Walker, Balmer et al., 1989, Hills, Takacs et al., 1989). The differences were related to differences in water binding and mobility. The evaporative results suggested that the EWC of the material was important in determining a material's potential to dehydrate in this way. Similarly, the NMR water self-diffusion coefficient was also found to be largely (if not wholly) determined by the WC. A specific binding model confirmed that the we was the dominant factor in determining the diffusive behaviour, but also suggested that subtle differences existed between the materials used, based on their equilibrium we (EWC). However, an alternative modified free volume model suggested that only the current water content of the material was important in determining the diffusive behaviour, and not the equilibrium water content. It was shown that T 2 relaxation was dominated by chemical exchange between water and exchangeable polymer protons for materials that contained exchangeable polymer protons. The data was analysed using a proton exchange model, and the results were again reasonably correlated with EWC. Specifically, it was found that the average water mobility increased with increasing EWe approaching that of free water. The T 1 relaxation was also shown to be reasonably well described by the same model. The main conclusion that can be drawn from this work is that the hydrogel EWe is an important parameter, which largely determines the behaviour of water in the gel. Higher EWe results in a hydrogel with water that behaves more like bulk water on average, or is less strongly 'bound' on average, compared with a lower EWe material. Based on the set of materials used, significant differences due to composition (for materials of the same or similar water content) could not be found. Similar studies could be used in the future to highlight hydrogels that deviate significantly from this 'average' behaviour, and may therefore have the least/greatest potential to dehydrate on the eye...|$|E

3000|$|From 44 to 41  Ma {{before the}} present (the early {{period of the}} {{deposition}} of Es 3 z [...]), the top boundary of the strata was buried at 1700  m at temperatures of 90  °C, and the bottom boundary was buried at 2380  m at temperatures of 120  °C. According to Surdam’s studies (Surdam et al. 1984, 1989), significant organic acid generation occurs during burial evolution. The temperature range of the maximum concentration of short-chain carboxylic acids is 75 – 90  °C (a peak of kerogen releasing oxygen-containing groups), and the optimum temperature for organic acid preservation is 80 – 120  °C. At lower temperatures, organic acids may be decomposed by bacteria. When the temperature rose to 120 – 160  °C, carboxylate anions were converted into hydrocarbons and CO 2 by thermal decarboxylation, raising the concentration of CO 2 in solution and reducing the concentration of organic acids. However, the presence of organic acids maintained the pH of the fluids at 5 – 6 during this time. When the temperature was higher than 160  °C, the organic acids were completely converted to CO 2, and the pH of the solution during this time was mainly controlled by the concentration of CO 2. During this stage, the organic matter in Es 4 x [...] had begun to mature and released a large quantity of organic acids. The temperature range during this stage was favorable {{for the preservation of}} organic acids, which caused the pH of the formation water to become acidic. Because of the shallow burial, the development of primary porosity, and good pore connectivity, the strata also exhibited the properties of an open hydrologic system with normal fluid pressure. In this environment, feldspar dissolved to form secondary pores. This resulted in the precipitation under appropriate conditions of authigenic kaolinite and first phase quartz overgrowths. As stated above, the time of the early feldspar dissolution as determined by the homogenization temperatures of aqueous inclusions in the quartz overgrowths was approximately dated to 42  Ma before the present, which {{is the same as the}} feldspar dissolution under an organic acid environment. A study by Wang (2010) suggested that gypsum began to convert to anhydrite through dehydration as the formation temperature exceeded 90  °C, and large-scale dehydration can be expected during 100 – 150  °C. Thus, at approximately 42  Ma, significant amounts of gypsum started to <b>dehydrate</b> <b>as</b> the bottom temperature reached 100  °C, with a portion of OH− and Ca 2 + dissolving in the water from dehydration of gypsum. However, the concentration of organic acids in the strata during this period reached a maximum, which caused the formation water to remain acidic. Under conditions of acidic formation water, Ca 2 + does not precipitate as carbonate. As the temperature reached 100  °C, smectite gradually transformed into illite through the middle state of the mixed-layer of illite/smectite (I/S) in alkaline potassium-rich solutions (Wang 2010). Although the temperature reached the conversion temperature of smectite to I/S, and although the formation water was rich in K+ and Al 3 + because of feldspar dissolution, smectite was not converted to I/S because of the presence of the acidic formation water. Although secondary pores were abundant during this stage, primary pores still dominated the reservoir spaces in the SPDZs in Es 4 x [...] because of the short dissolution time (only 3  Ma) and the development of primary pores (Fig.  6). From 41 to 24.6  Ma before the present (late depositional period of the Dongying Formation), the top boundary of the strata was buried at 3090  m at temperatures of 130  °C, and the bottom boundary was buried at 3690  m at temperatures of 150  °C. The decarboxylation of organic acids began during this period, which formed CO 2 and hydrocarbons and significantly reduced the concentration of organic acids. Gypsum entered the large-scale dehydration stage, during which the presence of alkaline water controlled the pH of the formation water. In this alkaline environment, smectite quickly transformed into I/S, which released metal ions such as Ca 2 +, Na+, Fe 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Si 4 +. In this alkaline environment, which was rich in K+, Fe 2 +, and Mg 2 +, the early kaolinite was rapidly converted to illite and chlorite. Under alkaline conditions with Ca 2 +, Fe 2 +, and Mg 2 +, detrital quartz and the early stage overgrowths dissolved to form secondary pores, and significant amounts of carbonate cements precipitated to fill primary pores and early feldspar pores. The reservoirs in Es 4 x [...] exhibit three stages of hydrocarbon accumulation. The first stage occurred from the end of the depositional period of Es 2 (or the early depositional period of Es 3 z [...]) to the late depositional period of the Dongying Formation, from approximately 38  Ma (or 41  Ma) to 24.6  Ma before the present. The second and third stages experienced continuous charging of hydrocarbons, which occurred from the mid-late depositional period of the Guantao Formation to the present (Song et al. 2009 a, b). A study by Sui et al. (2010) showed that when the nearshore subaqueous fans in the northern zone of the Minfeng Sag were buried deeper than 3200  m, the inner fan sub-facies acted as lateral seals for the hydrocarbon reservoirs. Therefore, the middle fan could have formed lithologic traps because of the lateral plugging of the inner fan and the normal lacustrine mudstone seal. Thus, when the organic matter became highly mature, massive amounts of oil and gas migrated into the top part of the “fan-anticlines” and middle fan lithologic traps at depths greater than 3200  m, which formed early hydrocarbon reservoirs. A study on the evolution of formation pressure showed that this hydrocarbon charging period was accompanied by fluid overpressure, which protected the reservoir pores. The point contacts of grains and abundant primary pores can still be identified in the Fengshen 1 well (Wang 2007) (Appendix Fig. 10 A). Carbonate cementation was significantly inhibited in reservoirs with hydrocarbon charging, and the present reservoirs are characterized by a lower amount of euhedral carbonate cements (Appendix Fig. 10 B). However, reservoirs without hydrocarbon charging were intensely filled by carbonate cements because of the long duration of the alkaline environment. A statistical analysis of the percentage of secondary pores after carbonate cementation showed that the reservoir spaces in the SPDZs were mainly primary pores, and the percentage of secondary pores was less than 15  % (Wang 2010) (Fig.  6).|$|E
