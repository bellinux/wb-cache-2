5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by <b>humic</b> acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are <b>humic</b> acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali {{and less likely to}} contain contaminants from the sample's environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.|$|E
5|$|Phallus hadriani is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and thus}} obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to coastal dunes, while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and <b>humic</b> forest soils, and live in symbiosis with xerophilous grasses and the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia. The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by <b>humic</b> acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>humic</b> acids {{may prevent}} excess salination, {{especially}} given excessive irrigation. <b>Humic</b> acids can fix both anions and cations and eliminate them from root zones. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include saltbush, a plant found {{in much of}} North America and in the Mediterranean regions of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes viridis is {{endemic to}} the Philippines. It has been {{recorded}} from coastal areas of Dinagat and Samar, and {{from a number of}} surrounding micro-islands. Plants generally grow terrestrially on <b>humic</b> and rocky soils, often in direct sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Most {{microbial}} {{cells are}} electrochemically inactive. Electron transfer from microbial cells to the electrode is facilitated by {{mediators such as}} thionine, methyl viologen, methyl blue, <b>humic</b> acid and neutral red. Most available mediators are expensive and toxic.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{sturgeon}} is {{a critically}} endangered species native to China. It is largely dispersed over the main streams of the Yangtze River and coastal regions of Qiantang River, Minjiang River, and Pearl River. The adults are predators that consume any aquatic animal {{that can be}} swallowed, while the young feed on aquatic insects, larvae, diatoms, and <b>humic</b> substances.|$|E
25|$|Igapó {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by sandy acidic soils that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water {{is due to the}} acidic organic <b>humic</b> substances (e.g. tannins) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as <b>humic</b> and fulvic acids”. Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal biomass. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest phosphorus concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to anoxic conditions which limits plant growth.|$|E
25|$|Upland {{lakes and}} reservoirs: Typically {{located in the}} {{headwaters}} of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, protozoa or algae will be present. Where uplands are forested or peaty, <b>humic</b> acids can colour the water. Many upland sources have low pH which require adjustment.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{that it is possible to}} form a reactive barrier by adding something to the soil which will cause the uranium to become fixed. One method of doing this is to use a mineral (apatite) while a second method is to add a food substance such as acetate to the soil. This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In peat-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the <b>humic</b> acids, this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.|$|E
25|$|The Sabana Formation was {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene glaciations and interglacials ("ice ages"). The fluctuations in climate in the Eastern Colombian Andes {{have been studied}} around Lake Fúquene {{at an altitude of}} , {{to the north of the}} Bogotá savanna. During the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene, the paleoecology of the region varied drastically, marking movements of the upper tree line and the types of vegetation. Pollen analysis shows that páramo vegetation was abundant from 30 ka to 17,500 years ago, with an increase in Andean forest frequency dated at 15.6 ka. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years BP, a decrease in Andean forest percentage is observed, indicative of a colder climate than before. This period has been named the Fúquene stadial. The stadial is followed by an interstadial (Guantivá), with an increase in lake levels of Lake Fúquene. The wetter periods of the interstadial covered earlier paleotopography with <b>humic</b> sediments.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of bogs have the correct {{conditions}} for preservation of mammalian tissue. Most of these are located in colder climates near bodies of salt water. For example, {{in the area of}} Denmark where the Haraldskær Woman was recovered, salt air from the North Sea blows across the Jutland wetlands and provides an ideal environment for the growth of peat. As new peat replaces the old peat, the older material underneath rots and releases <b>humic</b> acid, also known as bog acid. The bog acids, with pH levels similar to vinegar, conserve the human bodies {{in the same way as}} fruit is preserved by pickling. In addition, peat bogs form in areas lacking drainage and hence are characterized by almost completely anaerobic conditions. This environment, highly acidic and devoid of oxygen, denies the prevalent subsurface aerobic organisms any opportunity to initiate decomposition. Researchers discovered that conservation also required that they place the body in the bog during the winter or early spring when the water temperature is cold—i.e., less than 4°C (40°F). This allows bog acids to saturate the tissues before decay can begin. Bacteria are unable to grow rapidly enough for decomposition at temperatures under 4°C.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale {{differs from}} bitumen-impregnated rocks (oil sands and {{petroleum}} reservoir rocks), <b>humic</b> coals and carbonaceous shale. [...] While oil sands do originate from the biodegradation of oil, heat and pressure have not (yet) transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum, {{that means that}} its maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic.|$|E
500|$|In {{environmental}} science acid–base equilibria {{are important for}} lakes and rivers; for example, <b>humic</b> acids are important components of natural waters. Another example occurs in chemical oceanography: in order to quantify the solubility of iron(III) in seawater at various salinities, the pKa values {{for the formation of}} the iron(III) hydrolysis products Fe(OH)2+, [...] and Fe(OH)3 were determined, along with the solubility product of iron hydroxide.|$|E
500|$|Samples for dating {{need to be}} {{converted}} into a form suitable for measuring the [...] content; this can mean conversion to gaseous, liquid, or solid form, depending on the measurement technique to be used. Before this can be done, the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents. This includes removing visible contaminants, such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial. [...] Alkali and acid washes {{can be used to}} remove <b>humic</b> acid and carbonate contamination, but care has to be taken to avoid destroying or damaging the sample.|$|E
500|$|Three major {{types of}} organic matter (macerals) in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Telalginite is defined as {{structured}} organic matter composed of large colonial or thick-walled unicellular algae such as Botryococcus and Tasmanites. Lamalginite includes thin-walled colonial or unicellular algae that occur as distinct laminae, but display few or no recognizable biologic structures. Under the microscope, telalginite and lamalginite are easily recognized by their bright shades of yellow under ultraviolet/blue fluorescent light. Bituminite is largely amorphous, lacks recognizable biologic structures, and displays relatively low fluorescence under the microscope. Other organic constituents include vitrinite and inertinite, which are macerals derived from the <b>humic</b> matter of land plants. These macerals are usually found in relatively small amounts in most oil shales.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.ananas {{typically}} grow scattered or in groups under oak and pine trees, often on their bases. In Guyana, the mushroom typically fruits singly or in pairs within [...] {{above ground level}} on the trunks of the tropical tree Dicymbe corymbosa (subfamily Caesalpinioideae), associated with ectomycorrhizas within <b>humic</b> accumulations. It is rarely found fruiting on the ground on heavily decayed, root-penetrated wood. Rolf Singer suggested that the fungus was not mycorrhizal, noting {{that as well as}} occurring under or on the bases of both pine and oaks, it occurred in scanty humus and debris accumulated on rock walls. Singer concluded that the species prefers to grow on hard surfaces. Harry D. Thiers, in his study of the bolete flora of Texas, wrote that B.ananas was a rare species that often fruited abundantly following an extended period of rain and high humidity.|$|E
500|$|Some {{varieties}} of B.ananas from southeastern North America, Costa Rica, Brazil, Panama, Nicaragua, and Guyana {{have been noted}} to fruit on tree trunks, although terrestrial fruiting {{has been reported in}} Malaysia and Central America. Due to the typically elevated fruiting habit and occurrence on dead wood, the ectomycorrhizal status of B.ananas has been debated; in the protolog Murrill noted [...] "it always occurs either as a wound parasite on pine trunks or about the base of living pine trees." [...] All collections have been made in association with ectotrophic host trees including Pinus and Quercus species in southeastern North America and Central America, Quercus humboldtii [...] in Colombia, various Fagaceae and Dipterocarpaceae species in Malaysia, and Leptospermum and Pinus species in New Zealand. In Guyana, the <b>humic</b> deposits on Dicymbe trunks bearing B.ananas are consistently permeated with abundant ectomycorrhizas. The fungus was reported as forming mycorrhizal associations with eucalypts in Australia, based on fruit body association with trees.|$|E
2500|$|Jiří Hála's {{textbook}} {{states that}} soils vary greatly {{in their ability}} to bind radioisotopes, the clay particles and <b>humic</b> acids can alter the distribution of the isotopes between the soil water and the soil. [...] The distribution coefficient Kd is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g−1) to that of the soil water (Bq ml−1). [...] If the radioactivity is tightly bonded to by the minerals in the soil then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and grass growing in the soil.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{studies have}} shown that the {{mobility}} of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower “than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.” [...] Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent. The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from “sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with <b>humic</b> acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils”. [...] From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.|$|E
2500|$|In earth science, hot {{chemical}} weathering {{is attributed to}} organic chelating agents (e.g., peptides and sugars) that extract metal ions from minerals and rocks. [...] Some metal complexes in the environment and in nature are not found {{in some form of}} chelate ring (e.g., with a <b>humic</b> acid or a protein). Thus, metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil, the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms. Selective chelation of heavy metals is relevant to bioremediation (e.g., removal of 137Cs from radioactive waste).|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, the Soviet {{geologist}} Nikolai Alexandrovitch Kudryavtsev {{proposed the}} modern abiotic hypothesis of petroleum. On {{the basis of}} his analysis of the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada, he concluded that no [...] "source rocks" [...] could form the enormous volume of hydrocarbons, and therefore offered abiotic deep petroleum as the most plausible explanation. (<b>Humic</b> coals have since been proposed for the source rocks.) [...] Others who continued Kudryavtsev's work included Petr N. Kropotkin, Vladimir B. Porfir'ev, Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk, Vladilen A.

2500|$|Grasslands {{contribute}} to soil organic matter, stored mainly in their extensive fibrous root mats. Due {{in part to}} the climatic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced grass-fires. [...] While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the <b>humic</b> material. [...] They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of char that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.|$|E

2500|$|Chemical {{digestion}} {{follows a}} number of steps. [...] Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to remove <b>humic</b> substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture. The use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) to digest silicate minerals was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly {{reducing the amount of}} time required to scan slides for palynomorphs. Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge {{because of the presence of}} well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. Acetolysis was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them. In acetolysis the specimen is treated with acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid, dissolving cellulistic materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Humic</b> {{substances}} in soils and sediments {{can be divided}} into three main fractions: <b>humic</b> acids, fulvic acids, and humin. The <b>humic</b> and fulvic acids are extracted as a colloidal sol from soil and other solid phase sources into a strongly basic aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. <b>Humic</b> acids are precipitated from this solution by adjusting the pH to 1 with hydrochloric acid, leaving the fulvic acids in solution. This is the operational distinction between <b>humic</b> and fulvic acids. Humin is insoluble in dilute alkali. The alcohol-soluble portion of the <b>humic</b> fraction is, in general, named ulmic acid. So-called [...] "gray <b>humic</b> acids" [...] (GHA) are soluble in low-ionic-strength alkaline media; [...] "brown <b>humic</b> acids" [...] (BHA) are soluble in alkaline conditions independent of ionic strength; and fulvic acids (FA) are soluble independent of pH and ionic strength.|$|E
50|$|<b>Humic</b> acids are a {{principal}} component of <b>humic</b> substances, {{which are the}} major organic constituents of soil (humus), peat and coal. It is also a major organic constituent of many upland streams, dystrophic lakes, and ocean water. It is produced by biodegradation of dead organic matter. It {{is not a single}} acid; rather, it is a complex mixture of many different acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups so that the mixture behaves functionally as a dibasic acid or, occasionally, as a tribasic acid. <b>Humic</b> acids can form complexes with ions that are commonly found in the environment creating <b>humic</b> colloids. <b>Humic</b> acids are insoluble in water at acid pH, whereas fulvic acids are also derived from <b>humic</b> substances but are soluble in water across the full range of pH. <b>Humic</b> and fulvic acids are commonly used as a soil supplement in agriculture, and less commonly as a human nutritional supplement. As a nutrition supplement, fulvic acid {{can be found in a}} liquid form as a component of mineral colloids. Fulvic acids are poly-electrolytes and are unique colloids that diffuse easily through membranes whereas all other colloids do not.|$|E
