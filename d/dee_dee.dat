5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it. However, he is {{frequently}} in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3; Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often wreaking havoc with his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, feels a reluctant affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E

However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff. <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone would only record the additional vocals {{on the album}} citing that {{the other members of}} the band (including himself) were going through personal troubles and changes to the point where he didn't want to be in the band anymore. After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> became sober and left the band.|$|E
5|$|Allison Moore, {{a college}} friend of Tartakovsky, was cast as <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee.</b> She left the show {{after the first}} season because {{she was no longer}} {{interested}} in voice acting.

5|$|Subterranean Jungle is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; {{this is because}} guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly {{because many of the}} band members were dealing with alcohol addiction, or in bassist <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone's case, cocaine.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the Ramones {{released}} ¡Adios Amigos!, their fourteenth studio album, {{and announced}} that they planned to disband {{if it was not}} successful. Its sales were unremarkable, garnering it just two weeks on {{the lower end of the}} Billboard chart. The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour. However, they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival, which toured around the United States during the following summer. After the Lollapalooza tour's conclusion, the Ramones played their final show on August 6, 1996, at the Palace in Hollywood. A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We're Outta Here!. In addition to a reappearance by <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee,</b> the show featured several guests including Motörhead's Lemmy, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, Numskull's Ralph Foster and Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen.|$|E
5|$|The California punk {{scene was}} in full swing by early 1977. In Los Angeles, there were the Weirdos, the Zeros, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Germs, X, the Dickies, Bags, and the {{relocated}} Tupperwares, now dubbed the Screamers. San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known as the Young Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E
5|$|Greenwald {{debuted in}} WCW as the evil Miss Madness, one of Randy Savage's valets along with Gorgeous George and Madusa. Savage asked Greenwald and Madusa to train his then-girlfriend Gorgeous George in real life, {{highlights}} {{of which were}} shown on WCW television. As part of the storyline, this villainous alliance, called Team Madness, would interfere in matches {{for the benefit of}} Savage. Behind the scenes, Greenwald and Madusa trained the other women of WCW at the WCW Power Plant. Eventually, Savage betrayed Miss Madness by firing her from Team Madness along with Madusa after a championship loss. She then became Mona, a fan favorite, who wrestled in a blue cocktail dress and barefoot. She embarked on mini-feuds with Madusa, Little Jeannie, and Asya. Independent female wrestlers, such as <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Venturi and Brandi Alexander, were also brought in to wrestle Mona. WCW released Greenwald, however, in August 2000 in a cost-cutting move.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> formed another {{short-lived}} project named <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone and the Chinese Dragons, {{which was}} followed by the most successful of his post-Ramones projects, a group named <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone I.C.L.C. (Inter-Celestial Light Commune), which lasted from 1994 to 1996. The group featured New York City bassist John Carco (formerly of Queens hardcore group Misguided) who befriended <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> when the two attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings together during the summer of 1992. After writing more than a dozen songs and recording several demos for an upcoming Ramones album with producer Daniel Rey, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> decided to keep the material for his new band. After working with several drummers and playing several live shows in the New York City area, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> and Carco moved to Amsterdam to record a four-song EP and fourteen-track album for Rough Trade Records. I Hate Freaks Like You was released on April 17, 1994, featuring Nina Hagen on two of the album's fourteen tracks. The three-piece line up now consisted of <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> (vocals, guitar), Carco (bass, vocals), and Dutch drummer Danny Arnold Lommen.|$|E
25|$|On Halloween, 1998, while {{staying at}} the Hotel Chelsea, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> and Zampini met the Hollywood band SEXYCHRIST, which {{featured}} adult film star Kurt Lockwood. Lockwood encouraged them to move to Hollywood, and together the two bands shared a successful tour of the U.S. in early 1999. Afterwards, <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> formed the <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone Band, with members including Christian Martucci (vocals and guitar), Anthony Smedile (drums), Chase Manhattan (drums), and Stefan Adika (bass).

5000|$|Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father, is less critical.

25|$|<b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> {{was present}} when the Ramones were {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, the first year they were eligible, and not long after lead singer Joey had died. <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> humorously congratulated himself at the induction. He died later that year.|$|E
25|$|The second {{solo album}} was called Hop Around; the line-up {{consisted}} of <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone, Barbara Ramone/Zampini, Chris Spedding on guitars and Billy Rogers on drums. <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> also released Greatest and Latest, with Barbara, Spedding and Chase Manhattan on drums. This album consisted of re-recording of Ramones songs, a re-recorded solo song ("Fix Yourself Up", originally from Zonked!/Ain't It Fun?), cover-songs and an unreleased new solo-song ("Sidewalk Surfin'").|$|E
25|$|His next album—a live album {{produced}} by Gilby Clarke (ex-Guns N' Roses), {{to have been}} recorded on June 12, 2002, at Hollywood's Key Club—never materialized. Several bootlegs of the <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone Band exist, including, Live in Milan, Italy. Dee Dee's final studio recordings were released by tREND iS dEAD! records as the 2002 album Youth Gone Mad featuring <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee</b> Ramone. He also worked with the band Terrorgruppe.|$|E
50|$|When {{the warrant}} was issued, police {{entered the house}} and soon found <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee's</b> body. A GoFundMe account {{was set up to}} pay for her funeral expenses, and {{possibly}} Gypsy's. All who knew the Blanchardes feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube.|$|R
5000|$|Producer Daniel Rey {{became a}} co-writer by helping the {{structure}} of the song, while producer Jean Beauvoir of the Plasmatics helped give the song a more commercial style fit for radio play and film inclusion. As [...] "Pet Sematary" [...] sounded closer to the rock ballads of the period, it was a struggle for Johnny Ramone to play the arpeggios and chords despite <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee's</b> guidance.|$|R
5|$|Dexter's Laboratory was {{inspired}} by one of Genndy Tartakovsky's drawings of a ballerina. After drawing <b>Dee</b> <b>Dee's</b> tall, thin shape, he decided to pair her with a short and blocky opposite, Dexter, inspired by Tartakovsky's older brother Alex. After enrolling at the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation, Tartakovsky wrote, directed, animated, and produced four short films that would become {{the basis for the}} series.|$|R
