5|$|The university's campus {{has gone}} through {{continuous}} development since 1928. The main campus's six original buildings are of Collegiate Gothic architecture, designed by William Lyon Somerville, who also laid out the initial campus plan. They are now flanked by over fifty structures built predominantly during the boom in the 1950s, 1960s and during the 2000s. The largest facility is the McMaster University Medical Centre, a multi-use research hospital {{that is home to}} the second-largest neonatal intensive care unit and the third-largest child and youth mental <b>health</b> <b>unit</b> in the country. It is connected to the Life Sciences building and the Michael DeGroote Centre for Learning & Discovery, which houses many well-funded research groups in areas of genetics, infectious diseases, and several specific conditions.|$|E

40|$|In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care {{released}} the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Protocol, which mandated local <b>health</b> <b>units</b> to develop emergency response plans {{consistent with the}} Incident Management System (IMS).

This paper identifies some of the factors present in <b>health</b> <b>units</b> that consistently implement IMS during incident and emergency response. A questionnaire was developed to collect data from 34 of the 35 <b>health</b> <b>units</b> in Ontario. The findings reveal that <b>health</b> <b>units</b> have been successful in accomplishing the mandated requirements of the Protocol, including writing public health emergency plans using the IMS format, operating Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) using IMS, and having annual exercises to test the plans, but the levels of preparedness or success were broad and varying across the <b>health</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, they go through a {{security}} classification screening and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their security level, educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental <b>health</b> <b>unit),</b> and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment. At most prisons, prisoners are made to wear prison uniform.|$|E

25|$|Ardill {{served as}} a doctor for four years during World War I, {{respectively}} in Britain, France and Egypt. Her application to serve with the Australian Expeditionary Forces was rejected {{because she was a}} woman. At that time, Australian government policy prohibited women from service, compelling them to join overseas units instead. Katie therefore travelled to Britain via Egypt {{to become one of the}} first women doctors in the British Expeditionary Forces field services. She worked at the County Middlesex War Hospital, St. Albans, England. This was previously an asylum, but in September 1915 it was reopened as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers as they arrived from the Western Front. It is unclear what her role was at this hospital, which had 1600 beds and the capacity to treat 250 men in its specialist military mental <b>health</b> <b>unit.</b> However, the unit was run by the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, and received volunteer staff from Voluntary Aid Detachments, the Red Cross, and St John's Ambulance among others, it is likely that she entered the hospital as a volunteer recruited from one of the latter units. She then worked at the Anglo-Belgian Base Clearing Military Hospital at Étaples in France, where she was the only Australian woman doctor until 1917, and was later promoted to the rank of captain. Other service included posts at Napbury, the Dover military hospital, and the Citadel hospital, Cairo, all with the British Army.|$|E
500|$|The first {{hurricane}} {{to impact}} the Azores since Hurricane Gordon in 2012, Alex brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the archipelago. It {{is the only}} known hurricane to track within 230mi (370km) of the Azores outside of August and September. Rainfall totals reached [...] in Lagoa, São Miguel, and [...] in Angra do Heroísmo, Terceira. Wind gusts exceeded [...] on Santa Maria Island and peaked at [...] in Ponta Delgada, São Miguel. The strong winds brought down trees, inflicted damage on some roofs, and triggered scattered power outages. Additionally, minor flooding was observed. Six homes in Ponta Delgada sustained flood damage and another had its roof destroyed. Landslides occurred across parts of the central islands, though they caused only limited damage. The overall effects of the storm were less than initially feared, possibly due to the maximum winds being located far from the center as Alex underwent extratropical transition. The hurricane indirectly led to one death—the person {{suffered a heart attack}} unrelated to the storm—when an Island <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> helicopter was unable to take off due to turbulent conditions.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS) is {{an ongoing}} {{population}} health survey conducted by a collaborating group of Ontario public <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> This formative evaluation examined the process effectiveness, collaboration, utility and cost-effectiveness of RRFSS during its first year of operation. Methods: An Evaluation Framework was developed with reference to guidelines for evaluation of surveillance systems developed by the World Health Organization and the U. S.

The study focussed on evaluable performance areas in a young surveillance system and on information needed to inform stakeholder decisions about future participation and improvement.

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County <b>Health</b> <b>Unit)</b> at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
