40|$|After the {{discovery}} of grid cells, which are an essential component {{to understand how the}} mammalian brain encodes spatial information, three main classes of computational models were proposed in order to explain their working principles. Amongst them, the one based on continuous attractor networks (CAN), is promising in terms of biological plausibility and suitable for robotic applications. However, in its current formulation, it is unable to reproduce important electrophysiological findings and cannot be used to perform path integration for long periods of time. In fact, in absence of an appropriate resetting mechanism, the accumulation of errors overtime due to the noise intrinsic in velocity estimation and neural computation prevents CAN models to reproduce stable spatial <b>grid</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we propose an extension of the CAN model using Hebbian plasticity to anchor grid cell activity to environmental landmarks. To validate our approach we used as input to the neural simulations both artificial data and real data recorded from a robotic setup. The additional neural mechanism can not only anchor <b>grid</b> <b>patterns</b> to external sensory cues but also recall <b>grid</b> <b>patterns</b> generated in previously explored environments. These results might be instrumental for next generation bio-inspired robotic navigation algorithms that take advantage of neural computation in order to cope with complex and dynamic environments...|$|R

Many researchers has explore the fractal pattern as a new concept of turbulence generators, but rarely researcher does study in fractal turbulence generator on the structure premixed flame. The turbulent flow field characteristics have been studied to be used to investigate in a premixed combustion application. In term of turbulence intensity, most researchers used fractal grid that can tailor so that they can design the characteristic needed in premixed flame. This approach makes it extremely difficult to determine the exact turbulent burning velocity on the velocity fluctuation of the flow. The decision to carry out additional research on the effect circle grid fractal plate as a turbulent generator for premixed flame should depends on the blockage ratio and fractal <b>pattern</b> of the <b>grid...</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Ranibizumab(lucentis) combined with macular <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> photocoagulation {{in the treatment of}} macular edema caused by branch retinal vein occlusion(BRVO). METHODS:Forty-two patients(42 eyes) diagnosed as macular edema caused by BRVO by fundus fluorescence angiography(FFA) and optical coherence tomography(OCT) were enrolled. The patients were randomized divided into two groups:group 1 (combined therapy group) received lucentis intravitreal injection combined with macular <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> photocoagulation; group 2 (photocoagulation therapy group) received macular <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> photocoagulation only. The best corrected visual activity(BCVA), central macular thickness(CMT) and complications were compared between the two groups at 1, 3 and 6 mo after treatments. RESULTS:Compared to before treatments, at 1, 3 and 6 mo after treatments:the changes of BCVA and CMT were significant different in group 1 (P P > 0. 05); but at 3 and 6 mo after treatments:BCVA and CMT improved gradually and the differences were significant in group 2 (P P CONCLUSION:Ranibizumab intravitreal injection combined with macular <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> photocoagulation therapy can effectively reduce macular edema caused by BRVO, improve vision acuity. Compared with macular <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> photocoagulation therapy, combination therapy works more quickly, and reduces macular edema more...|$|R

40|$|Grid-based {{measurement}} {{can facilitate}} metrology and inspection of flexible electronics manufacturing. Multiple fundamental difficulties, however, {{arise in the}} large-area and full-field deformation measurement of deformable <b>grid</b> <b>patterns</b> including noise, occlusions, and artifacts. This paper addresses {{one of the key}} issues in deformation measurement: the registration and matching of deformed <b>grid</b> <b>patterns.</b> The emphasis is on accurate and robust periodicity tracing registration and constellation matching algorithms for <b>grid</b> <b>pattern</b> fidelity. The registration algorithm uses deviation metrics in deformed grids to estimate global translation, rotation and scaling; the matching algorithm uses the constellation reference grid to mine buried deformed point patterns. Using synthetic data, the validity of the registration algorithm is proved by registering noisy deformed <b>grid</b> <b>patterns</b> with various distortion scales and transformations; the validity of the matching algorithm is proved by matching deformed <b>grid</b> point <b>patterns</b> with various distortion scales, extra point rates and missing point rates. Compared to established non-rigid registration and point pattern matching algorithms, our algorithms demonstrate higher speed, sub-pixel accuracy and robustness in the matching of highly-deformed and noisy grids.
