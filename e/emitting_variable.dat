40|$|The recent {{detection}} of gamma-ray emission from four radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies {{suggests that the}} engine driving the AGN activity of these objects share some similarities with that of blazars, namely {{the presence of a}} gamma-ray <b>emitting,</b> <b>variable,</b> jet of plasma closely aligned to the line of sight. In this work we analyze the gamma-ray light curves of the four radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies for which high-energy gamma-ray emission has been discovered by Fermi/LAT, in order to study their variability. We find significant flux variability in all the sources. This allows us to exclude a starburst origin of the gamma-ray photons and confirms the presence of a relativistic jet. Furthermore we estimate the minimum e-folding variability timescale (3 - 30 days) and infer an upper limit for the size of the emitting region (0. 2 - 2 pc, assuming a relativistic Doppler factor delta= 10 and a jet aperture of theta= 0. 1 rad).

40|$|The compact radio, {{infrared}} and X-ray source Sgr A* {{is believed}} to be the manifestation of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Theory and observation attempt to determine the accretion and radiation physics behind the extreme under-luminosity and variability of this radio source. Sgr A* shows the feature of so-called flares, short bursts of increased radiation that last for about 20 - 100 min, suggesting that the emission is coming from the very close vicinity of the black hole. We investigate light curves from an <b>emitting,</b> <b>variable</b> hot spot co-moving with the accretion disk. Using ray-tracing techniques, we reconstruct time-dependent images and spectra of the accretion emission region, as seen by a distant observer. In the current research, the disk model is supposed to be standard keplerian, geometrically thin and optically thick in a Kerr (spinning) geometry. The trajectories of photons emerging from the emitting blob at the surface of the accretion disk, near the last stable orbit, including all relativistic effects such as light bending, gravitational lensing, redshift or time dilation are calculated.

An important subset of these sources is pulsar stars. Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars, which generate pulsed radiation throughout the electromagnetic spectrum with periods ranging from milliseconds to thousands of seconds. A detailed analysis of several X-ray pulsars is presented to quantify expected spacecraft range accuracy based upon the source properties, observation times, and X-ray photon detector parameters. High accuracy time transformation equations are developed, which include important general relativistic corrections. Using methods that compare measured and predicted pulse time of arrival within an inertial frame, approaches are presented to determine absolute and relative position, as well as corrections to estimated solutions. A recursive extended Kalman filter design is developed to incorporate the spacecraft dynamics and pulsar-based range measurements. Simulation results demonstrate that absolute position determination depends on the accuracy of the pulse phase measurements and initial solutions within several tens of kilometers are achievable. The delta-correction method can improve this position solution to within 100 m MRSE and velocity to within 10 mm/s RMS using observations of 500 s and a 1 -m 2 detector. Comparisons to recorded flight data obtained from Earth-orbiting X-ray astrophysics missions are also presented.

40|$|In principle, {{the most}} {{straightforward}} {{method of estimating}} the Hubble constant relies on time delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed sources. It is a puzzle, then, that the values of H 0 obtained with this method span a range from 50 - 100 km/s/Mpc. Quasars monitored to measure these time delays, are multi-component objects. The variability may arise from different components of the quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a <b>variable</b> <b>emitting</b> region in a jet with emission from the core region may introduce an error in the Hubble constant derived from a time delay. Here, we investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying physical explanation of the widespread in values of the Hubble constant based on gravitational lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the derived value of the Hubble constant is very sensitive to the offset between {{the center of the}} emission and the center of the <b>variable</b> <b>emitting</b> region. Thus, we propose using the value of H 0 known from other techniques to spatially resolve the origin of the variable emission once the time delay is measured.

We investigate the variability of Sgr A* with two different photometric methods and analyze its flux distribution. We find Sgr A* is continuously <b>emitting</b> and continuously <b>variable</b> in the near-infrared, with some variability occurring on timescales as long as weeks. The flux distribution can be described by a lognormal distribution at low intrinsic fluxes (<~ 5 mJy, dereddened with A_{Ks}= 2. 5). The lognormal distribution has a median flux of approximately 1. 1 mJy, but above 5 mJy the flux distribution is significantly flatter (high flux events are more common) than expected for the extrapolation of the lognormal distribution to high fluxes. We make a general identification of the low level emission above 5 mJy as flaring emission and of the low level emission as the quiescent state. We also report here the brightest Ks-band flare ever observed (from August 5 th, 2008) which reached an intrinsic Ks-band flux of 27. 5 mJy (m_{Ks}= 13. 5).

40|$|Background. In this study, a {{new type}} of Er:YAG laser, <b>emitting</b> {{irradiation}} with <b>variable</b> pulse duration, has been used for blepharoplasty and skin resurfacing in periocular region. More than 40 patients have been treated with second generation Er:YAG laser (Fotona Fidelis) for blepharoplasty and skin resurfacing. A focused laser beam (diameter 0. 4 mm) with very short pulse width (100 µs), that is significantly below the thermal relaxation time of skin, leads to a precise cut with no observable thermal effect on surrounding tissue. The depth of the cut is approximately 1 – 2 mm, precision comparable to a surgical scalpel. The high repetition rate of consecutive laser pulses (50 Hz at 120 mJ energy) accounts for accumulation of thermal load in tissue, and thus leads to complete hemostasis of the cut tissue. Due to improved cutting abilities of the Er:YAG laser, excision of orbital fat is also performed with one pass of the laser beam. By changing the laser parameters to short pulses (300 µs), energy 500 mJ, spot diameter 5  mm and repetition rate 12 – 15 Hz, skin resurfacing was performed. No special pretreatment therapy was used. Anesthesia: 2 % Xylocain inj. subcutaneously. Non adhesive dressing for 24 hours was applied after surgery. Epithelisation was complete after ten days. Redness persists up to 5 weeks. Discomfort of patients was mild. Cosmetic results are satisfying. Conclusions. New generation of Er:YAG laser offers a possibility to cut and coagulate the tissue simultaneously, and by changing the parameters to ablate the tissue with heating influence on skin collagen. </p...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{conversation}} with the staff from Sharp, we decided to highlight {{the integration of the}} proposed system with the Units shown during the meeting. We have therefore developed and detailed design of the large dome proposal in the first stage keeping in mind, however, that the Units may also be integrated in the devices of the suspensions and of desk design. The choice of the dome is motivated by three considerations: one hand we have preferred, given the time available to investigate only one of the proposed topics; in terms of size and performance, the dome expresses the best, the complexity of the choices made; Units built in the last dome form a constellation of radial lights reminding formal characteristics of known elements of lighting culture of the architectural and design. In the lighting culture exists in fact the Sky Simulator, which are lighting devices able to mimic changes in sunlight. These devices are used for the simulation of the solar radiation, received by the buildings reproduced in scale and placed underneath the simulator. In the architectural reference, is that of “Ventana des Esterellas all’Alambra” of Cordoba, or luminous ceilings of buildings made of concrete-glass, while the design is reminiscent of the effect of light textured made by some Italian lamps successfully produced in the 90 ’s. These references refer to a Light Skype connecting the light source to the sky, to the choreography of lights in it and, in reference to the Light Simulator, to changes in sunlight. Each single unit can play these variations both in brightness and in colour temperature, because the individual Unit are in fact interconnected by bus DMX and controlled by a central unit that can be driven even in remote or wireless. The variation of colour temperature may be produced by both the identical and simultaneous variation of light in all units, or by the additive synthesis produced by summation of different lights produced by the individual units. In this case, the dome will be able to modify continuously the temperature from 2700 K to 6500 K, in this case the colour of the light <b>emitted</b> may be <b>variable</b> and will follow the circadian rhythm. The variation of the brightness and colour temperature achieved in an indoor environment, and even if not consciously perceived, reproduces the changing of sunlight and gives a wellness and reduces the fatigue from the ennui fixed and constant lighting. The dome, as already said, will also issue colored lights, when all the units simultaneously or to additive synthesis will produce a frequency 460 nm, said Blue Sky you will get a light capable of inhibiting the production of melatonin favouring the mental activities and the ‘attention. And ‘in fact a particular blue part of the spectrum of light that has a powerful effect and uplifting. Inside the eye, a family of specialized cells are sensitive for ‘see’ the blue colour of the sky that has a frequency of 460 nm. When these photo-receptors transposing the blue light,the nerve impulses of the brain detect, waking up, increasing attention and concentration. The dome will realize a complex system that will not only light but also will promote the well-being and physical and mental activities of those who will be working, discussing and thinking in their luminous and iridescent protectio...|$|R
