[...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth."

Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal."
