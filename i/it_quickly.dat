5|$|Early on September 5th, a {{hurricane}} was first observed about 65mi (110km) southeast of Christiansted in the Danish Virgin Islands. One meteorologist assessed the hurricane as being located near Antigua on September 3. Tracking steadily west-northwestward, <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> moved ashore near Ponce, Puerto Rico with winds estimated at 80mph (130km/h). After crossing southwestern Puerto Rico, the hurricane emerged into the Mona Passage as a tropical storm. Late on September 5 it made landfall on eastern Dominican Republic; <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> weakened over Hispaniola, dissipating on September 6 over the northwestern {{portion of the}} island. An assessment by scholar Michael Chenoweth in 2006 indicated this storm {{was the same as}} the next hurricane, with it continuing northwestward and ultimately reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Due to not being considered the same cyclone in the official hurricane database, this hurricane and the following hurricane are listed separately.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} and an upper level trough interacted on October 10 {{to the south}} of Bermuda, and formed an extratropical storm.

Karen strengthened to reach 80mph (130km/h) winds as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> became extratropical.|$|E
