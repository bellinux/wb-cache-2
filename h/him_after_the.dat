5|$|A {{separate}} {{account of the}} battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald's army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith's men cut their way through to him and slew <b>him.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> death of his son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E

5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> president left office.|$|E

If Stratus won, she would get a championship rematch the next week; if Bischoff won, he would get to spend a night with her. Bischoff {{would go on to}} win the match, though the stipulation was nulified when Linda McMahon confronted <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> match.|$|E

In January 1966, attorney and land developer Charles W. Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E

As his skating was considered a weakness, he spent the subsequent off-season training to improve it.|$|E
5|$|His next {{attempt at}} a {{comeback}} was with the Dallas Cowboys, who signed <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Buccaneers released him, but he failed his first physical and was let go on September 5.

Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> match. They faced each other at WrestleMania X, where Owen defeated Bret. The rivalry continued, however, and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995. Bret's feud with Lawler remained, but the two did not face each other again until In Your House 1 in May 1995. The feud was reignited at that time, and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995.|$|E

Cubs {{prospects}} Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez credited Ramirez for his help with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> loss of his uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was {{no longer going to}} coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain as to what Ramirez would do next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.|$|E
5|$|Regenbald's {{lands are}} {{recorded}} in a charter from {{the reign of}} King Henry I of England which dealt with the gift of those lands after Regenbald's death. This charter lists a number of estates as owned by Regenbald that were also listed in Domesday Book as Regenbald's, {{but there are a}} few other possessions that did not get recorded in Domesday. The lands listed include lands in Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Dorset. Domesday lists the value of Regenbald's lands at £40 per year. His estates totalled about 90 hides, although some of the estates were given to <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Norman Conquest.|$|E
5|$|Romantic {{thinking}} was {{also evident in}} the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of <b>him</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E
