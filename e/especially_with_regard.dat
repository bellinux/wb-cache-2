Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced that they were in close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E

But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E

Reception of the anime has been mixed with those who reviewed the first volume critical of the anime's sexual themes, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to Mii, while those who reviewed the series as a whole have tended to give overall more positive reviews, praising the story's unexpected depth.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, {{as well as the}} passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion.

Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns.

5|$|After {{a series}} of transfers, Overbeck tried to sell the {{territory}} to Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy but all rejected his offer. Overbeck then co-operated with the British Dent brothers (Alfred Dent and Edward Dent) for financial backing to develop the land, with the Dent company persuading him that any investors would need guarantees of British military and diplomatic support. Overbeck agreed to this co-operation, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to the counterclaims of the Sultan of Sulu, part of whose territory in the Sulu Archipelago had been occupied by Spain. Overbeck, however, withdrew in 1879 and his treaty rights were transferred to Alfred Dent, who in 1881 formed the North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd to administer the territory. In the following year, Kudat was made its capital but due to frequent pirate attacks, the capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884. To prevent further disputes over intervention, {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885, recognising the sovereignty of the King of Spain over the Sulu Archipelago in return for the relinquishment of all Spanish claims over northern Borneo. The arrival of the company brought prosperity to the residents of northern Borneo, with the company allowing indigenous communities to continue their traditional lifestyles, but imposing laws against headhunting, ethnic feuds, slave trade, and piracy. North Borneo then became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 despite facing local resistance from 1894 to 1900 by Mat Salleh and Antanum in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, {{the period}} between 1889 and 1914 was marked by a spate of {{patriotic}} literature, theatre and visual art. Serbian artists competed with one another over who would produce the best depictions of Serbia's medieval history, and the best Serbian national romantic art was made during this time. One {{of the most prominent}} Serb artists of the day was the realist Paja Jovanović, who was known for his sprawling historical works. In 1899, the special committee hired him to compose a scene depicting Dušan's coronation to be displayed in Paris. In return for his services, he received an honorarium of 30,000 dinars. The government felt it was essential that Jovanović's work and those of other Serbian artists be well received. Given decades of political instability in the Balkans, the authorities sought to promote a positive image of their country abroad, especially by familiarizing Western Europeans with Serbian art. Hence, Jovanović was painting for a dual audience, both domestic and foreign. His foremost goal was to emphasize the legitimacy of Serbia's contemporary territorial claims before the Great Powers, <b>especially</b> <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> to Kosovo, Macedonia and the Sandžak (then divided between the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary), and counter any negative views of the Serbian state. For his domestic audience, Jovanović's goal was to remind his countrymen of Serbia's rich history and encourage patriotic sentiments. After consulting with the politician and historian Stojan Novaković, Jovanović decided against painting a scene from Dušan's coronation, and opted to depict the proclamation of Dušan's Code instead. As a result, the painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as The Coronation of Tsar Dušan (Serbian: Krunisanje Cara Dušana).|$|E
