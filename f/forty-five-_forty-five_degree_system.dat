60|$|The {{height of}} the Ridge, {{according}} to the account at hand, varies along its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain; it slopes at an angle of about <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was rising}} {{at an angle}} of about <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees</b> dead ahead of us, with the evident {{intention}} of combing us with grappling hooks from above as it skimmed low over our deck.|$|R
60|$|This slope ran at an {{inclination}} {{of nearly}} <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees</b> for about fifty yards {{when it turned}} sharply to the right, terminating in a small chamber where the vein had probably came to an end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking of sharks," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "up at Niihau {{there was a}} man--" [...] And {{at that moment the}} table lifted and heaved, and I gazed upward at him at an angle of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|General Electric {{developed}} and produced the A-model and subsequent B-model at {{a plant in}} Syracuse, New York. The unit consisted of two antennas. One of the antennas slanted at a <b>forty-five</b> <b>degree</b> angle to provide the height-finder capability.|$|R

60|$|The {{boys were}} scared and both cried out lustily. They {{did not fall}} far, however--in fact, they rather rolled, for the second opening was on a slant of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees.</b> They brought up against {{something}} soft, {{but this time it}} was not a bank of decayed leaves.|$|R
60|$|And {{suddenly}} the aeropile slipped {{over the edge}} of the Council House and fell. It dropped, tilting at an angle of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees,</b> and dropping so steeply that it seemed to Graham, it seemed perhaps to most of these below, that it could not possibly rise again.|$|R
60|$|And the men obeyed {{with such}} alacrity and such inconceivable violence, that the {{stricken}} enemy did not await the onset. They incontinently sloped {{at an angle}} of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees</b> with mother earth, and scooted towards the river, into which they all plunged without a moment's consideration.|$|R
50|$|In Musō Shinden-ryū, the {{sheathing}} {{is performed}} horizontally with the blade outwards.

[p.154]From Wady Laymun to Meccah the distance, {{according}} to my calculation, was about twenty-three miles, the direction South-East <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees.</b> We arrived {{on the morning of}} Sunday, the 7th Zu’l Hijjah (11th September, 1853), and had one day before the beginning of the pilgrimage to repose and visit the Harim.|$|R
60|$|But Richard {{discovered}} his mistake, {{when he saw}} Billy Kirby before him, standing with his feet in the water, at an angle of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees,</b> inclining southward, and expending his gigantic strength in sustaining himself in that posture. He ceased his remonstrances, and proceeded to the party at the other line.|$|R
50|$|The group’s {{form and}} musicality {{depend on the}} piece, but they {{typically}} use the Kinnara stance: a <b>forty-five</b> <b>degree</b> body and legs equidistant outside of the shoulders with the left knee paramount to the stance and the back leg more straight. They also use the thrust stance that most taiko players use today.|$|R

60|$|Jack had {{stumbled}} upon a large opening {{directly in the}} midst of the brush.

60|$|Well, while things stood thus, {{suddenly}} the HISPANIOLA struck, staggered, ground {{for an instant}} in the sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees</b> and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.|$|R
6000|$|... "The count has {{certainly}} with him, the seven new ships that were built last season," [...] quietly observed Bluewater, {{leaning back in}} his easy-chair, until his body inclined at an angle of <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees,</b> and stretching a leg on an empty stand, in his usual self-indulgent manner.

40|$|The SLD {{experiment}} at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center had {{a significant}} gap in its muon tracking coverage, provided by the Warm Iron Calorimeter. Supplemental planes of limited streamer tube chambers were added to improve the coverage {{in the vicinity of}} the gap at 0. 65 < |cos(theta) |< 0. 85. A software effort to upgrade the tracking software for this system is detailed. The commissioning of the <b>forty-five</b> <b>degree</b> chamber region of the SLAC SLD Warm Iron Calorimeter is presented. This task involved the completion of the <b>forty-five</b> <b>degree</b> chamber region geometry for the Warm Iron Calorimeter's fitter and swimmer and the changing of the way multiple scattering effects are treated in the fitter algorithm.

60|$|At Mr. Tippengray's {{spontaneous}} {{exhibition of}} tender affection, Mr. Petter involuntarily and reverently {{took off his}} hat, while Mrs. Cristie and Lodloe clapped their hands.

5000|$|Upon {{the command}} of [...] "fire", the soldier pulled the trigger, and the musket (hopefully) fired. A full second was allowed to pass, and the musket was then quickly lowered to the loading position, butt against the soldier's right hip, muzzle held off center to the left at about a <b>forty-five</b> <b>degree</b> angle, and the soldier would look down at his open pan to {{determine}} if the prime had been ignited.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after this}} sad event the winter began to exhibit unwonted signs of severity. It had begun earlier, and {{continued}} later than usual. The snow averaged three feet {{deep in the}} plains and four feet in the woods, and the cold was intense, being frequently down to <b>forty-five</b> <b>degrees</b> below zero of Fahrenheit's scale, while the ice measured between five and six feet in thickness on the rivers.|$|R
