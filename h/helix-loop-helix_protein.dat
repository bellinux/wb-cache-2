One of these E boxes interacts selectively with representative {{members of the class}} A group of basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins,</b> including HTF 4, E 47, and their heterodimers. Our analyses implicate the <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins</b> in regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression. The binding sites for a number of regulatory proteins share a common core motif (CANNTG) known as an E box (reviewed in reference 26). For example, an E box (CACGTG) defines the core binding motif for heterodimers of max and c-myc implicated in controlling cell proliferation (6), and selected E-box motifs in the promoters and enhanc-ers of cellular genes have been shown to interact with basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> (bHLH) <b>proteins</b> which function in activa-tion of gene expression (reviewed in references 9 and 26).

40|$|AbstractMembers of the Id {{family of}} <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins</b> are ubiquitously {{expressed}} and dimerize {{with members of}} the class A and class B basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins.</b> Due to the absence of a basic region, Id proteins act as dominant-negative antagonists of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, which regulate cell growth and differentiation in diverse cell types. Recent findings suggest that the functions of Id proteins are well regulated at both the transcriptional level and the post-transcriptional level. We show here that the alternative splicing variant of human Id- 1 protein possesses a different binding specificity for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Therefore, alternative splicing of Id- 1 could provide a post-transcriptional mechanism to regulate Id- 1 function...|$|R

The 9aaTAD transactivation domains of E proteins and MLL are very similar and both bind to the KIX domain of general transcriptional mediator CBP.

40|$|The transcriptionally {{regulatory}} {{regions of}} the lymphomagenic Akv and SL 3 - 3 murine leukemia retroviruses (MLVs) contain two types of E-box consensus motifs, CAGATG. One type, EA/S, {{is located in the}} upstream promoter region, and the other, E(gre), is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties. We have examined the requirements of the individual E-boxes in MLV transcriptional regulation. In lymphoid cell lines only, the E(gre) -binding protein complexes included ALF 1 or HEB and E 2 A basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins.</b> Ectopic ALF 1 and E 2 A proteins required intact E(gre) motifs for mediating transcriptional activation. ALF 1 transactivated transcription of Akv MLV through the two E(gre) motifs equally, whereas E 2 A protein required the promoter-proximal E(gre) motif. In T- and B-cell lines, the E(gre) motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity, while the EA/S motif had some effect. In contrast, neither E(gre) nor EA/S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3 T 3 cells lacking DNA-binding ALF 1 or HEB and E 2 A proteins. The Id 1 protein was found to repress ALF 1 activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ectopic Id 1 repressed E(gre) -directed but not EA/S-directed MLV transcription in lymphoid cell lines. In conclusion, E(gre) motifs and interacting basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins</b> are important determinants for MLV transcriptional activity in lymphocytic cell lines...|$|R
40|$|The cardiac {{alpha-actin}} gene {{is expressed}} in both heart and skeletal muscle. In skeletal myogenic cells, the 177 -base-pair promoter of the human cardiac alpha-actin (HCA) gene requires three transcription factors for activation: Sp 1, serum response factor (SRF), and MyoD. However, MyoD is undetectable in heart. To search for a functional equivalent of MyoD, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the HCA promoter in primary cultures of rat cardiac myocytes. The same DNA sequence elements recognized by SRF, Sp 1, and MyoD and required for HCA transcription in skeletal muscle cells were also found to be necessary for expression in cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Id, a negative regulator of basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins,</b> selectively attenuated expression of the HCA promoter. Cardiomyocyte nuclei contain a protein complex that specifically interacts with the same required sequence (E box) in the HCA promoter that is bound by MyoD in skeletal myogenic cells. Furthermore, these complexes contain a peptide that {{is a member of}} the E 2 A family of basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins.</b> Cardiomyocyte nuclei appear to be enriched for a protein that can bind to the E-box site as dimers with the E 12 protein. These results suggest that a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family, together with SRF and Sp 1, activates the HCA promoter in heart. Alternative strategies for myocardial transcription of HCA are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The proneural {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in groups of cells (proneural clusters) from which one progenitor cell - typically {{the one in the}} middle - will be singled out, leading to the formation of many different types of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Proneural genes encode a group of bHLH proteins that play crucial roles in controlling cell fate in a variety of tissue types. [...] Basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins</b> are characterized by two alpha helixes separated by a loop. The helixes mediate dimerization, and the adjacent basic region is required for DNA binding. The human genome contains approximately 125 bHLH factors.|$|R
50|$|The Emc protein has a <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> domain {{without the}} basic region, making it unable to bind to DNA {{and act as}} a {{transcription}} factor. It does, however, {{have the ability to}} bind other basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing proteins, such as the products of the achaete-scute complex (ac-s), to form dimers that inactivate the target protein, which is usually a transcription factor. In this way, the Emc protein can {{have an effect on the}} gene expression of many genes during Drosophila development.|$|E
50|$|MXD3 {{is a basic}} <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> {{belonging}} to a subfamily of MAX-interacting proteins. This protein competes with MYC for binding to MAX to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding complex. MXD3 is a transcriptional repressor that is specifically expressed during S phase of the cell cycle. The protein is implicated in both normal neural development and {{in the development of}} brain cancer. In medulloblastoma cells, MXD3 binds E-box sequences, leading to increased cell proliferation at moderate MXD3 levels but increased cell death and apoptosis at higher expression levels.|$|E
5000|$|E-box binding {{proteins}} play a {{major role}} in regulating transcriptional activity. These proteins usually contain the basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> structural motif, which allows them to bind as dimers. This motif consists of two amphipathic α-helices, separated by a small sequence of amino acids, that form one or more β-turns. The hydrophobic interactions between these α-helices stabilize dimerization. Besides, each bHLH monomer has a basic region, which helps mediate recognition between the bHLH monomer and the E-box (the basic region interacts with the major groove of the DNA). Depending on the DNA motif ("CAGCTG" [...] versus [...] "CACGTG") the bHLH protein has a different set of basic residues.|$|E
40|$|Basic <b>helix–loop–helix</b> (bHLH) DNA-binding <b>proteins</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to regulate tissue-specific transcription within multiple cell lineages. The Id family of <b>helix–loop–helix</b> <b>proteins</b> does not possess a basic DNA-binding domain and functions as a negative regulator of bHLH proteins. Overexpression of Id proteins within a variety of cell types {{has been shown to}} inhibit their ability to differentiate under appropriate conditions. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Id- 1 leads to activation of telomerase activity and immortalization of primary human keratinocytes. These immortalized cells have a decreased capacity to differentiate as well as activate phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Additionally, these cells acquire an impaired p 53 -mediated DNA-damage response as a late event in immortalization. We conclude that bHLH proteins play a pivotal role in regulating normal keratinocyte growth and differentiation, which can be disrupted by the immortalizing functions of Id- 1 through activation of telomerase activity and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein...|$|R
40|$|Myogenesis is a multistep process {{controlled}} by a transcriptional cascade in which myogenesis regulatory factors (MRFs) have a crucial role [1]. MRFs are a family of basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins,</b> composed by Myo-D, Myf- 5, Myogenin and MRF- 4 [2]. They are not activated at the same time: in fact, Myo-D and Myf- 5 induce differentiation at earlier step, while Myogenin and MRF- 4 are important for myotube formation and for myogenic lineage maintenance [2, 3].

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} identified common variants in transcription factor 4 (TCF 4) as susceptibility loci for schizophrenia, Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. By contrast, rare TCF 4 mutations cause Pitt–Hopkins syndrome, a disorder characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, and {{have also been}} described in patients with other neurodevelopmental disorders. TCF 4 therefore sits at the nexus between common and rare disorders. TCF 4 interacts with other basic <b>helix–loop–helix</b> <b>proteins,</b> forming transcriptional networks that regulate the differentiation of several distinct cell types. Here, we review the role of TCF 4 in these seemingly diverse disorders and discuss recent data implicating TCF 4 as an important regulator of neurodevelopment and epithelial–mesenchymal transition...|$|R
50|$|Expression of the c-myc gene, which {{produces}} an oncogenic transcription factor, is tightly regulated in normal cells but is frequently deregulated in human cancers. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor thought to negatively regulate MYC function, {{and is therefore}} a potential tumor suppressor. This protein inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by competing for MAX, another basic <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> that binds to MYC and is required for its function. Defects in this gene are frequently found in patients with prostate tumors. Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist but the products of these transcripts have not been verified experimentally.|$|E
50|$|ParvE101Q is an {{experimental}} modification of parvalbumin, designed to delay calcium sequestration in heart muscles to enhance contraction. The protein parvalbumin has EF hand motifs used for calcium binding. EF hands are structural <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> subunits {{that have a}} high affinity for calcium ions, and a moderate affinity for magnesium ions. In muscle, the binding of Ca2+ by parvalbumin efficiently sequesters it following contraction. This increases the speed of muscle relaxation, allowing the muscle to contract again sooner. Although parvalbumin is classified as a delayed calcium buffer, it quickly sequesters Ca2+, usually before the muscle is done fully contracting. Large amounts of parvalbumin allow rapid contractions of muscles at a high contractile speed with the trade-off of having relatively lower contraction force. This decreased force of contraction {{is due to the}} rapid sequestration of Ca2+, preventing prolonged contraction which is required for greater force.|$|E

Id, {{a member}} of the <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>protein</b> family, is an inhibitor of transcriptional activation by basic-helix-loop-helix proteins. In the developing mouse kidney, Id mRNA was observed as early as 12. 5 days post-coitum (dpc) specifically in the condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric buds by in situ hybridization. At 14. 5 dpc, Id mRNA was localized to the collecting tubules and developing glomeruli while the surrounding mesenchyme lacked Id hybridization. From birth to day 10 postnatal, Id mRNA is were localized in to the collecting tubules, immature glomeruli and renal pelvis. In the adult kidney, Id mRNA was detectable by Northern blot analysis but no cell type-specific localization was noted by in situ hybridization. These results indicate a role for HLH-bHLH proteins in the differentiation of the epithelial structures of the kidney...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} mixing {{purified}} MyoD and E 47 proteins results in heterodimers {{that fail to}} bind DNA, even though MyoD and E 47 homodimers can bind DNA efficiently. Addition of cell extracts or a specific fraction from a cell extract enables the heterodimer to bind DNA, but components in this fraction fail to enter the DNA complex. The activity is sensitive to heat and protease and is not ATP-dependent. The activity functions on E 47 and MyoD homodimers and can stimulate DNA binding of the basic-helix-loop-helix region of MyoD. The effectiveness of the activity, for MyoD homodimers, depends on the exact DNA sequence of the binding site. Our results suggest that specific factors in the cell might control the DNA-binding properties of <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompared to neurons, the {{intracellular}} {{mechanisms that}} control glial differentiation are still poorly understood. We show here that oligodendrocyte lineage cells express the <b>helix-loop-helix</b> <b>proteins</b> Mash 1 and Id 2. Although Mash 1 {{has been found}} to regulate neuronal development, we found that in the absence of Mash 1 oligodendrocyte differentiation occurs normally. In contrast, we found that overexpression of Id 2 powerfully inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation, that Id 2 normally translocates out of the nucleus at the onset of differentiation, and that absence of Id 2 induces premature oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. These findings demonstrate that Id 2 is a component of the intracellular mechanism that times oligodendrocyte differentiation and point to the existence of an as yet unidentified MyoD-like bHLH protein necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation...|$|R

Moreover, we have identified sequences within tal that potentially encode an amphipathic helix-loop-helix motif, a DNA-binding domain found {{in a variety of}} proteins that control cell growth and differentiation. The homology domain of tal is especially related to that of lyl- 1, a gene on chromosome 19 that has also been implicated in T cell oncogenesis.

50|$|As stated earlier, the {{combination}} of Myf5 and MyoD {{is crucial to the}} success of myogenesis. Both MyoD and Myf5 are members of the myogenic bHLH (basic <b>helix-loop-helix)</b> <b>proteins</b> transcription factor family. Cells that make myogenic bHLH transcription factors (including MyoD or Myf5) are committed to development as a muscle cell. Consequently, the simultaneous deletion of Myf5 and MyoD also results in a complete lack of skeletal muscle formation. Research has shown that MyoD directly activates its own gene; this means that the protein made binds the myoD gene and continues a cycle of MyoD protein production. Meanwhile, Myf5 expression is regulated by Sonic hedgehog, Wnt1, and MyoD itself. By noting the role of MyoD in regulating Myf5, the crucial interconnectedness of the two genetic factors becomes clear.|$|R
