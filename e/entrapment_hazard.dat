50|$|As {{the cargo}} {{compartment}} {{of a vehicle}} often cannot be opened from within, installation of a cargo barrier may become an <b>entrapment</b> <b>hazard</b> for children or adults. In some cases, a removable plastic window in the barrier is sometimes provided to enable access to the passenger compartment. In other cases, an escape hammer is sometimes provided to allow escape by breaking a rear window.|$|E

50|$|Many old {{abandoned}} structures feature hazards such as unstable structures, unsafe floors, broken glass, {{the presence}} of unknown chemicals and other harmful substances (most notably asbestos), stray voltage, and <b>entrapment</b> <b>hazards.</b> Other risks include freely roaming guard dogs and hostile squatters. Some abandoned locations may be heavily guarded with motion detectors and active security patrols, while others are more easily accessible and carry less risk of discovery.|$|R
50|$|Streamlining and {{maintaining}} a low profile and cross sectional area are important considerations but effectiveness and robust applicability {{to a wide range}} of environments are possibly more important, as they allow a basic core configuration that is effective in virtually any recreational diving situation, and allow standardisation of procedures, which in turn lets the diving team be assembled from similarly trained and equipped divers, who integrate more easily into an effective team. In this context, streamlining includes the aspect of reducing hydrodynamic drag when swimming, but more importantly, the reduction of entanglement and <b>entrapment</b> <b>hazards</b> due to equipment components to a minimum.|$|R
50|$|A {{cylinder}} net is a tubular net {{which is}} stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom. The {{function is to}} protect the paintwork from scratching, and on booted cylinders it also helps drain the surface between the boot and cylinder, which reduces corrosion problems under the boot. Mesh size is usually about 6 mm. Some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an <b>entrapment</b> <b>hazard</b> in some environments such as caves and the interior of wrecks. Occasionally sleeves made from other materials may be used to protect the cylinder.|$|E
40|$|The Anthropometry and Biomechanics Laboratory (ABL) at JSC conducts multi-disciplinary {{research}} {{focusing on}} maximizing astronaut intravehicular (IVA) and extravehicular (EVA) capabilities {{to provide the}} most effective work conditions for manned space flight and exploration missions. Biomechanics involves the measurement and modeling of the strength characteristics of the human body. Current research for the Space Shuttle Program includes the measurement of torque wrench capability during weightlessness, optimization of foot restraint, and hand hold placement, measurements of the strength and dexterity of the pressure gloved hand to improve glove design, quantification {{of the ability to}} move and manipulate heavy masses (6672 N or 1500 lb) in weightlessness, and verification of the capability of EVA crewmembers to perform Hubble Space Telescope repair tasks. Anthropometry is the measurement and modeling of the dimensions of the human body. Current research for the Space Shuttle Program includes the measurement of 14 anthropometric parameters of every astronaut candidate, identification of EVA finger <b>entrapment</b> <b>hazards</b> by measuring the dimensions of the gloved hand, definition of flight deck reach envelopes during launch and landing accelerations, and measurement of anthropometric design parameters for the recumbent seat system required for the Shuttle/Mir mission (STS- 71, Spacelab M) scheduled for Jun. 1995...|$|R
25|$|Two basic {{types of}} <b>entrapment</b> are {{significant}} <b>hazards</b> for scuba divers: Inability to navigate {{out of an}} enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of enclosed spaces, and when {{the objective of the}} dive includes penetration of enclosed spaces, taking precautions {{such as the use of}} lights and guidelines. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible.|$|R
