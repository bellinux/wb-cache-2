5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E

60|$|Particularly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{standing}} {{with my father}} on the wharf when a large ship was getting under way, and rounding {{the head of the}} pier. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> the yo heave ho! of the sailors, as they just showed their woolen caps above the high bulwarks. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> how <b>I</b> thought of their crossing the great ocean; and that that very ship, and those very sailors, so near to me then, would after a time be actually in Europe.|$|R

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{being in}} the back part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a {{particular}} sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> most of {{the video}} you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five {{different}} cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{when they}} came to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle of}} the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you {{possibly}} do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E

5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so {{positive}} and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

60|$|As I {{walked along}} in the sun <b>I</b> <b>{{remember}}ed</b> old Cotter's words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>I</b> had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were strange--in Persia, I thought.... But <b>I</b> could not <b>remember</b> {{the end of the}} dream.|$|R
5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (<b>I</b> <b>Remember),</b> an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

5|$|On February 25, 2011, {{while on}} his {{tour in the}} United Kingdom, he {{announced}} his new album would be called Love and Passion and would be released in September, but this was proven false as the title was tentative. American rapper Fabolous {{said in an interview}} that he is planning a collaboration album with Ne-Yo as well. Ne-Yo has also written songs for Mary J. Blige, JB, Beyoncé, Monica, Alexandra Burke, Cheryl Cole and Willow Smith's upcoming albums. Ne-Yo starred in two motion pictures, the long-gestating George Lucas project Red Tails, released in early 2012, and , which was released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Ne-Yo has already finished writing songs for American singer and Roc Nation artist Alexis Jordan and her self-titled debut album as well as Jennifer Hudson for her second studio album, <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> Me, which had a North American release on March 22, 2011. Ne-Yo appeared in the children's preschool show The Fresh Beat Band and was one of the few artists not to cancel appearances in the wake of the 2011 Japan earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
