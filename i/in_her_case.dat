5|$|When both {{phases of}} the inquiry were completed, Laming began writing the final report. The Laming report, {{published}} on 28 January 2003, found that the agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her, and that on at least twelve occasions, workers involved <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> could have prevented her death, particularly condemning the senior managers involved. On {{the day of the}} launch of the report, Climbié's mother sang her daughter's favourite song as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

Over {{the next year and}} a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a sleep study, hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, whether or not she had sustained any brain damage, and whether or not she was born mentally disabled. Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of emotional disturbance, but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral defense mechanisms were uncharacteristic of autism.|$|E

It follows her until age 26, in her quest for virtue. She is presented with sexual lessons, hidden under a virtuous mask. The unfortunate situations include: the time when she seeks refuge and confession in a monastery, but is forced to become a sex slave to the monks, who subject her to countless orgies, rapes, and similar rigours. When helping a gentleman who is robbed in a field, he takes her back to his chateau with promises of a post caring for his wife, but she is then confined in a cave and subject to much the same punishment. These punishments are mostly the same throughout, even when she goes to a judge to beg for mercy <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> as an arsonist, and then finds herself openly humiliated in court, unable to defend herself.|$|E

Edmond from Chicago. Kelly was introduced to Aaliyah by her uncle, Barry Hankerson, just three years prior when she was 12 years old. The marriage was annulled in February 1995 {{at the behest of}} Aaliyah's family by a Michigan judge. Kelly and Aaliyah, however, both denied that the marriage occurred and even denied that their relationship had ever moved beyond friendship. Despite denials of marriage, in May 1997 Aaliyah filed a lawsuit in Cook County to have the marriage records expunged. This action occurred {{in the midst of a}} suit filed by Tiffany Hawkins, who was seeking to use the marriage documents <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> Aaliyah stated in court documents that she was underage at the time of marriage and, under Illinois state law, could not legally enter into marriage without parental consent.|$|E

Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (<b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case,</b> her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{generally}} confined to underground {{roles in the}} French Resistance network. Lucie Aubrac, who {{has become a symbol}} of the French Resistance within France, never had a clearly defined role in the hierarchy of the movement, which <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> involved the regional Southern Liberation. Hélène Viannay, more highly educated than her husband Philippe Viannay, the founder of the Défense de la France, did not write one single article for the clandestine newspaper of the same name, nor did the other companions of the chiefs of the Défense de la France, although they did take part in meetings to edit the newspaper. On the other hand, Suzanne Buisson, cofounder of the Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) was the treasurer until her arrest. Only one woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, was a head of a network (by leading the British to believe that the true head of the Alliance network was actually a man). No woman ever led a movement, or a maquis (guerilla group) or a Liberation Committee, none was installed as a Commissioner within the Provisional Government of the Republic of France or a Minister of the Liberation.|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes... but as a public servant, she does {{not have the right to}} pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> has gone against her." ...|$|E

He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper—the leading lady he created for Torchwood— describing both as [...] "the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are [...] "relatable to all British people" [...] because they are seen as [...] "neutral". Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as [...] "evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion". Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to [...] "make her real" [...] and to [...] "give her a life". He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a [...] "sad story with her father" [...] the character has [...] "her own mythology, to match the Doctor." [...] Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is [...] "drawn from a cosmopolitan vision" [...] <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>case</b> because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show [...] "none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna". Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to be someone who is [...] "holding Rose back" [...] right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment. Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.|$|E
