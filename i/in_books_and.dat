5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} <b>in</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> songs for children; {{the reality of}} animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life.

5|$|Historically, {{the brain}} {{featured}} {{in popular culture}} through phrenology, a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to {{different regions of the}} cortex. The cortex remains important in popular culture as covered <b>in</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> satire. The brain features in science fiction, with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (beings with features like partly artificial brains). The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The sultanate's {{history was}} {{documented}} in accounts, letters and journals written by British and Dutch East India Company traders; its destruction was discussed <b>in</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> reports authored {{by representatives of}} the French embassies to Siam in the mid 1680s. Sultan Sulaiman's family history has also been chronicled: Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II and mother of King Rama III, was descended from Sultan Sulaiman; present-day descendants include the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand and a former Navy admiral. Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon include articles published in academic journals and letters written by General Sir Harry Prendergast, commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo-Burmese war.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived in shorts, driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashcans. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off {{on a personal level}} (both sharing similar tastes <b>in</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart. After some discussion, Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart's maniacal British style of drumming, reminiscent of The Who's Keith Moon.|$|E

5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond <b>in</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> fine printing.|$|E
