5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> only {{for maintaining the}} nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> only for the medieval structures that remain, but also for its monuments and fittings. The Victorian restoration is also noted as being of high quality and {{in keeping with the}} older parts of the church.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> <b>not</b> only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing {{is implied}} {{about how a}} {{particle}} gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one {{does not imply that}} it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling <b>is</b> <b>important,</b> <b>not</b> just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E

25|$|Viruses are capsid-encoding organisms {{composed}} of proteins and nucleic acids that can self-assemble after replication {{in a host}} cell using the host's replication machinery.

25|$|Like most dogs, Great Danes require daily {{walks to}} {{maintain}} their health. However, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems. Because of a puppy's natural energy, Dane owners often take steps to minimize activity while the dog is still growing.|$|E
25|$|When {{changes are}} {{introduced}} to the project, {{the viability of the}} project has to be re-assessed. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to miss a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E

25|$|To begin {{bringing}} the horse back, {{he should be}} exercised at the walk and trot for 10–15 minutes at least once every day. This regimen will gradually be increased as the horse becomes more willing. For a moderate or severe bout of ER, it may take 4–6 weeks {{to return to the}} regular program. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to push the horse more than he is ready or a relapse may occur. A second bout of ER is usually more severe than the first, not only taking the horse out of training for a longer time, but possibly causing permanent muscle damage.|$|E
25|$|In {{highlighting}} {{the severity of}} the Free State's execution policy, however, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to exaggerate its extent. The Free State took a total of over 12,000 Republicans prisoner during the war, of whom roughly 80, less than 1% were executed. How those who were executed were chosen from the others captured in arms is unclear; however, many more men were sentenced to the death penalty than were actually shot. This was intended to act as a deterrent to anti-Treaty fighters in the field, who knew that their imprisoned comrades were likely to be executed if they kept up their armed campaign.|$|E
25|$|Shadows of Yog-Sothoth <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> {{only because}} it {{represents}} the first published addition to the boxed first edition of Call of Cthulhu, but because its format defined {{a new way of}} approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length Call of Cthulhu publication. The standard of CoC scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. The Asylum and Other Tales, a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of White Dwarf magazine.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} of this role of {{disturbance}} is in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the western United States, where surface fires frequently thin existing vegetation allowing for new growth. If fire is suppressed, douglas fir (Pesudotsuga menziesii), a shade tolerant species, eventually replaces the pines. Douglas firs, having dense crowns, severely limit the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor. Without sufficient light new growth is severely limited. As the diversity of surface plants decreases, animal species that rely on them diminish as well. Fire, in this case, <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> only to the species directly affected but also to many other organisms whose survival depends on those key plants.|$|E
25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often not be known until the child starts school. People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts {{the meaning of}} the word libertas. In Christol’s view, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>not</b> to forget that the emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E
