25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People {{tend to focus on}} finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

ESPN later ranked his season {{one of the best}} ever for a perimeter player. In Game 1 of the playoffs, he scored 43 points to help Orlando take an early series lead against the top-seeded Detroit Pistons.

500|$|In May 2010, it was {{identified}} that Morison was eligible to represent Wales due to Welsh ancestry – as his grandmother {{was born in}} Tredegar, near Ebbw Vale. Wales assistant manager Roy Evans was present to watch Morison in Millwall's 1–0 victory against Swindon Town, while Morison [...] "registered his interest" [...] in representing Wales. In July 2010, Wales boss John Toshack named Morison in the Wales squad for a friendly against Luxembourg in Llanelli on 11 August 2010. On being called up to the Wales squad, Morison said [...] "It's a fantastic achievement and it <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be recognised for my hard work". Morison subsequently started in Wales' 5–1 victory against Luxembourg, playing the whole match and assisting Ashley Williams' goal. Following Morison's debut, manager John Toshack said [...] "I was very impressed with the debut of Steve Morison, he didn't get on the scoresheet, but he certainly made his presence felt".|$|E

500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come. This song just <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E

In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us.

[...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield".

[...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people.

500|$|... "Trivia" [...] {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{although many}} critics {{did not enjoy}} the Florida sub-plot. Many television critics agreed that [...] "Trivia" [...] was a marked improvement over many of the episodes {{in the first part}} of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, [...] "Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season." [...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable. It’s not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season." [...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The Office continues to find fun and unique ways to spotlight how mundane office life can be by showing ways the gang finds to fill their day." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and it <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be laughing again at The Office." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002–03, {{with the}} {{acquisitions}} of Gordan Giricek and Drew Gooden from the Memphis Grizzlies {{in exchange for}} Mike Miller, McGrady once again led the Magic to a 42–40 record. McGrady {{led the league in}} scoring with 32.1 ppg, made his second All-NBA 1st Team, and 3rd All-Star Team.

[...] Writer Shelby Powell {{took note of}} Slash's precision on guitar, rating the album 3.5/5 thumbs, but took off points for [...] "a little too much reverence paid to the 90s {{and some of the}} feature selections may have old head purists poking their bottom lips out and putting their lighters down," [...] but concludes that [...] "the assortment of genres blends well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, after {{struggling}} {{in the ratings}} for years, Days of Our Lives received a two-year pickup. However, the soap's budget was decreased by 40%.
