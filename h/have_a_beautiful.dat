5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is a moderate R song pacing in common time, {{written in the}} key of F♯ minor. The verses alternate from the chords of F and C. The track also draws from the hip hop, funk, and dance-pop genres. Mike Joseph of PopMatters observed that the song shows influences by 1970s funk music, and contains limited elements of 1980s go-go. According to Phil Harrison of Time Out, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] consists of a steady [...] "long crescendo, welding galloping beats and a steamrolling two-note riff", accompanied by several genres of music, which he qualified as [...] "multi-tracked". Spence D. of IGN Music noted that the song consists of frequent whistles as well as crashing cymbal dominated scatter rhythms and a beat which fits the [...] "powerful, loud, confident lines" [...] in which Beyoncé asks {{for the attention of}} her man, and urges women to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> dress to spice up their sexual life. [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] opens with a spoken introduction. Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings her lines in an assertive manner on melding shattering hi-hats" [...] and plinking keyboard pulses.|$|E
500|$|Millionaire socialite Henry J. [...] "Bob" [...] Topping Jr. (1948–1952). A {{brother of}} New York Yankees owner Dan Topping and a {{grandson}} of tin-plate magnate Daniel G. Reid, Topping proposed to Turner at the 21 Club in Los Angeles by dropping a diamond ring into her martini. The ceremony occurred {{three days after}} Topping was divorced from his third wife, actress Arline Judge, who had been previously married to his brother Dan. Although worth millions when they married, Topping suffered heavy financial losses due to poor investments and excessive gambling. The couple's marriage resulted in a church trial for the officiant because the marriage took place {{less than a year}} after Topping's divorce from Judge. Cheryl Crane writes in her memoir that her mother's wedding to Bob Topping was a beautiful, lavish affair held in the spacious Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, with all of the bells and whistles accompanying a traditional wedding. Despite the fact that both the bride and the groom had been married and divorced multiple times previously, Lana wore a traditional white gown, the bridesmaids wore equally beautiful gowns of Lana's choosing, and young Cheryl served as the flower girl. Crane goes on to state that she later saw this as her mother's attempt to finally <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful,</b> traditional wedding while she was still young after three failed marriages (to Artie Shaw and Steve Crane) in which the ceremonies took place before justices of the peace with Lana usually attired in a simple dress suit and heels.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{argued that}} the album was their most {{consistent}} and strongest album to date. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone felt that the album was [...] "experimental and expansive". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt that the album lacked [...] "freshness or spontaneity" [...] that {{was found in the}} band's debut album, calling only two songs on the album [...] "very visionary". Jim Farber of the Daily News criticized Williams, saying [...] "Even aided by studio correction, the guy can't sing", calling it [...] "bad singing at its engaging best". Cohen of Pitchfork Media bashed the lyrics, saying that the writing was [...] "far down the list of what N.E.R.D. is actually good at". Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned nothing from the lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused. Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams is not a [...] "technically gifted rapper", he [...] "does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> voice" [...] and his lyrics are [...] "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool' sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out [...] "typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his nonsensical verses". Dan Charnas of The Washington Post commended N.E.R.D for their songwriting, writing that Seeing Sounds [...] "combines the adolescent and clever". The Times writer Priya Elan gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that band is [...] "pushing the boundaries of the popular song". [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (...) and stated, [...] "Beats of course, songs usually, singing barely--especially sincere-type singing"; he also picked out two songs from the album: [...] "Anti-Matter" [...] and [...] "Everyone Nose (All the Girls Standing in the Line for the Bathroom)".|$|E
