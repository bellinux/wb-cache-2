5000|$|Upon his {{graduation}} from East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania {{with a degree}} in health and physical education, Catona became a high school health-science teacher and athletics coach. As a child, he dreamed of one day owning his own sandwich shop. In an effort to realize his dream and also further support his family, he opened “The Country Grocer” located in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. In 1983, as his business thrived, Catona saw a void that up to this time had not been filled. Having been raised in Philadelphia, a city known for many local food specialties, he started a mail-order food company called [...] "A Taste of Philadelphia". The first of its kind anywhere, “A Taste of Philadelphia” afforded people around the world the opportunity to send or receive a <b>gift</b> <b>package</b> complete with such delicacies as cheesesteaks, hoagies (submarine sandwiches), soft pretzels, Tastykakes, and many other food items not easily found outside the Philadelphia area. Also in that year, Catona made national headlines for attempting {{to be the first to}} ever send a Philadelphia hoagie into space. He contacted astronaut Guion S. Bluford Jr., a Philadelphia-area native and first African-American in space, asking if he would take one of Catona’s hoagies on board the space shuttle Challenger for mission STS-8 that would be taking place in August of that year. After spending for two years with researches and microbiologists from Widener University to develop a hoagie safe for space travel, it was decided by NASA that due to its size and many ingredients, a Philadelphia hoagie would not be a part of that particular space mission.|$|E
