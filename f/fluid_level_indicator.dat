50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicator,</b> seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|E
40|$|Many mining {{operations}} rely on bulkheads {{to provide a}} barrier between impounded water or slurry and active mine workings. However, bulkhead failures could cause and have caused catastrophic flooding that puts the underground workforce at risk. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 1 (NIOSH) {{in collaboration with the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is conducting research to evaluate the adequacy of existing design practices for water and slurry bulkheads. A key component of this research effort is documentation of the performance history and design parameters for bulkheads installed in underground coal mines during the last 20 + years. This research {{is part of a larger}} effort to develop general design guidelines and procedures for constructing and maintaining bulkheads that will help to ensure their long-term structural integrity, while significantly reducing the inundation risk for miners. This paper presents the results of NIOSH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s research to identify state-of-the-art bulkhead designs, including design criteria, leakage monitoring systems, and emergency warning systems. Underground observations and evaluations of existing bulkheads suggest that the most important design factors influencing their performance are the interface of the bulkhead with the surrounding strata and the potential magnitude of the hydraulic pressure to which they may be subjected. When a bulkhead has failed, leakage has generally been through the surrounding strata or along the bulkhead/strata interface, with the failure potential along the interface increasing with hydraulic head. It was also determined that development of a monitoring program to ensure the long term structural integrity of bulkheads is an important safety consideration. Current monitoring procedures range from weekly visual inspections to constant monitoring via pressure transducers and <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicators.</b> Where possible, these devices are used in conjunction with a computer based mine monitoring system to alert mine personnel when an emergency condition exists at the bulkhead installation...|$|R

40|$|Contactless {{fluid level}} {{detection}} in process equipment {{is an important}} challenge for the process automation industry, especially under high-pressure conditions. In this study, a method is presented, which permits the contactless measurement of liquid levels in thin opaque capillaries at high pressures. The method {{is based on the}} mass dependence of the flexural resonance frequencies of a finite section of a tube. These resonance frequencies are determined from the complex electrical impedance of a slitted toroid coil exciting a magnet attached to the tube. The system has been theoretically described using a set of two Bernoulli-Euler beams, resulting in an analytical solution for the equation of motion. To validate the model, experiments have been performed on a thick-walled stainless steel capillary partly filled with mercury. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the sensitivity of the method appears to be adequate as a <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> for control purposes in industrial applications...|$|E

40|$|Infections {{with the}} picornavirus, human {{rhinovirus}} (HRV), {{are a major}} cause of wheezing illnesses and asthma exacerbations. In developing a murine model of picornaviral airway infection, we noted the absence of murine rhinoviruses and that mice are not natural hosts for HRV. The picornavirus, mengovirus, induces lethal systemic infections in its natural murine hosts, but small genetic differences can profoundly affect picornaviral tropism and virulence. We demonstrate that inhalation of a genetically attenuated mengovirus, vMC 0, induces lower respiratory tract infections in mice. After intranasal vMC 0 inoculation, lung viral titers increased, peaking at 24 h postinoculation with viral shedding persisting for 5 days, whereas HRV-A 01 a lung viral titers decreased and were undetectable 24 h after intranasal inoculation. Inhalation of vMC 0, but not vehicle or UV-inactivated vMC 0, induced an acute respiratory illness, with body weight loss and lower airway inflammation, characterized by increased numbers of airway neutrophils and lymphocytes and elevated pulmonary expression of neutrophil chemoattractant CXCR 2 ligands (CXCL 1, CXCL 2, CXCL 5) and interleukin- 17 A. Mice inoculated with vMC 0, compared with those inoculated with vehicle or UV-inactivated vMC 0, exhibited increased pulmonary expression of interferon (IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-l), viral RNA sensors [toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR 7, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD 2) ], and chemokines associated with HRV infection in humans (CXCL 10, CCL 2).
