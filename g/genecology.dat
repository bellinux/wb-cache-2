40|$|Management {{of paper}} birch in {{mixedwood}} stands is a {{sustainable forest management}} practice. In addition to the ecological and economical benefits of mixedwoods, paper birch trees can maintain or enhance slope stability. This thesis attempted to quantify the contribution of birch root reinforcement in BC to slope shear resistance. The objectives of this thesis were to determine the: 1) genetic variation in paper birch root reinforcement, 2) environmental variation in root reinforcement between birch and pine, and 3) differences in root reinforcement between birch and pine. The first study compared the contribution of birch and pine roots (from different populations growing in three soil types) to soil shear resistance using two controlled environment shear tests (Sonotube and Polytube Experiments). The second study (Tree Uprooting Experiment) compared the vertical uprooting resistance of birch and pine growing in different soil types at three field study sites. The third study (<b>Genecology</b> Experiment) determined the variation of four birch populations growing at one location. Results from the tube experiments found that the roots of birch and pine trees contributed to {{a significant increase in}} shear strength, regardless of soil type. At a depth of 20 - 44 cm, paper birch increased shear strength by as much 88 %, while pine increased strength by as much as 61 %. There was little variation in root reinforcement among the six birch populations in the Sonotube Experiment, which suggested that these trees were from one generalist population rather than six specialist populations. Soil texture affected the root reinforcement of birch and pine in the Polytube Experiment~ both species had the highest root reinforcement in coarse textured sand and the least root reinforcement in medium textured silt. The limiting factor in root reinforcement, in this case, was attributed to a lack of water and nutrients in the silt soil. In the Tree Uprooting Experiment, birch trees had 50 % greater resistance to uprooting than did pine trees. Small diameter birch and pine at Aleza Lake had greater uprooting resistance than birch and pine at other field sites. However, larger diameter trees at Gregg Creek and Red Rock had greater uprooting resistance than similar size trees at Aleza Lake. Soil strength and moisture content may have accounted for the uprooting resistance differences among diameter classes at Aleza Lake. Results from the <b>Genecology</b> Experiment showed that the Skeena population had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the greatest height, diameter, and root biomass compared to the other three populations. The results from companion trials, and from the uprooting tests suggested that Skeena trees represent a generalist population. In the same experiment, the nursery where the trees were grown impacted uprooting resistance, even after five years growing in the field. The results from this study reconfirmed the significant length of time nursery can affect field performance. Significant findings arising from this thesis were that: 1) birch saplings have greater root strength than pine across all soil types, 2) root system structure has an important role in root reinforcement between tree species, 3) root reinforcement is maximized by birch and pine when growing in freely drained, cohesionless sandy soil, and 4) further study of birch <b>genecology</b> is needed to identify generalist, high performing populations such as Skeena. Overall, managing for mixedwoods in BC has both ecological and economical benefits, including enhanced slope stability. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Adaptation {{to winter}} cold in {{temperate}} and boreal trees involves complex genetic, physiological, and devel-opmental processes. Genecological studies demonstrate {{the existence of}} steep genetic clines for cold adaptation traits in relation to environmental (mostly temperature related) gradients. Population differentiation is generally stronger for cold adaptation traits than for other quantitative traits and allozymes. Therefore, these traits appear to be under strong natu-ral selection. Nonetheless, high levels of genetic variation persist within populations. The genetic control of cold adap-tation traits ranges from weak to strong, with phenological traits having the highest heritabilities. Within-population genetic correlations among traits range from negligible to moderate. Generally, bud phenology and cold hardiness in the fall are genetically uncorrelated with bud phenology and cold hardiness in the spring. Analyses of quantitative trait loci indicate that cold adaptation traits are mostly controlled by multiple genes with small effects and that quantitative trait loci Ã— environment interactions are common. Given this inherent complexity, we suggest that future research should focus on identifying and developing markers for cold adaptation candidate genes, then using multilocus, multi-allelic analytical techniques to uncover the relationships between genotype and phenotype at both the individual and population levels. Ultimately, these methods may be useful for predicting the performance of genotypes in breeding programs and for better understanding the evolutionary ecology of forest trees.

The overexpression of ALDOA was observed {{in a variety of}} cancers including clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, little was known about the clinicopathological significance and prognostic value of ALDOA in ccRCC patients. Methods: The expression of ALDOA was detected using immunohistochemical staining in 162 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ccRCC sections. Prognostic outcomes correlated with ALDOA were examined using Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: In patients with ccRCC, increased cytoplasmic ALDOA expression was positively associated with tumor size (P= 0. 021), TNM stages (P= 0. 034), lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 020), and overall survival (OS) (P< 0. 001). Kaplanâ€“Meier analysis showed that high cytoplasmic expression of ALDOA was associated with a statistically significant lower OS (P< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ALDOA expression was an independent and significant prognostic factor (HR = 3. 561, 95 % CI = 1. 715 â€“ 7. 396, P= 0. 001). ALDOA expression was not associated with significant prognostic deference in the subgroups of TNM stage I patients or pT 1 patients.

40|$|Paper birch is an ecologically {{valuable}} {{species with}} a broad geographic distribution and increasingly valuable commercial attributes. Its diversity, versatility and enduring nature make it an ideal candidate for a selective breeding program. However, {{an understanding of the}} <b>genecology</b> of the species and an understanding of the potential impacts of climate change will be fundamental to its success. The objectives of the trail were to determine if the phenotypic variability observed in paper birch for certain traits was due to genetics, the growing environment or an interaction between the two. Traits examined were bud flush (phenological) and height growth (morphological). Whether or not nursery practices were a factor was also examined. Twenty provenances of paper birch were collected from five regions in British Columbia (BC) and northern Idaho. Seedlings were grown at three nurseries in BC and Idaho and planted in a randomized single tree interlocking block design in three common gardens in BC and Idaho. Geographic variation in the timing of bud burst in paper birch is under genetic and environmental control. It follows climatic clines based on latitude, longitude and elevation. The signal for the onset of spring bud flush is determined by an interaction between air and soil temperature and photoperiod. Long distance displacement of provenances from their site of origin can lead to detrimental abiotic and biotic effects such as frost or pest damage. Differences in stock handling among nurseries and nursery displacement effects also influenced the growth and survival of some provenances. This information will be useful when developing seed zones and seed transfer guidelines for paper birch in BC. It will also help mitigate the potential impacts of climate change and will be beneficial if a selective breeding program is established.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on how a complex pathosystem, {{consisting}} of the plant (Plantago lanceolata), the weevil (Trichosirocalus troglodytes) and the fungus (Diaporthe adunca) functions in natural populations. In laboratory and garden experiments the weevil has previously been shown to transmit the fungus to the spikes of P. lanceolata, where infection usually starts. However, the interactions of this pathosystem in natural situations were unknown, for example, if the weevil and the fungus occur at the same place and time. To study this as well as the preference of the weevil and the fungus for certain environmental conditions, transects at 23 locations in the Netherlands were laid out. The effect of one of the environmental factors namely the mowing regime on epidemics of the fungus was experimentally tested in a hayfield. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that weevil and fungus preferred the same habitat. However, the data obtained during two years in 13 permanent transects, showed that the weevil was only active in spring and that the epidemic reached its maximum in autumn. These findings together with additional, circumstantial evidence presented suggest that the weevil does not play an important role in the transmission of the fungus in natural situations. The experiment with the mowing regimes showed that active management can exert an important effect on epidemics of the fungus. The later the vegetation is mown, the lower the level of disease at the end of the season. Late mowing can be seen as having a sanitary effect and might have negative consequences for disease occurrence in the long run.

An early stage melanoma can be surgically removed, with a survival rate of 99 %. However, metastasized melanoma is difficult to cure. The 5 -year survival rates for patients with metastasized melanoma are still below 20 %. Metastasized melanoma is currently treated by chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy. The outcome {{of most of the}} current therapies is far from optimistic. Although melanoma patients with a mutation in the oncogene v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B 1 (BRAF) have an initially higher positive response rate to targeted therapy, the majority develop acquired drug resistance after 6 months of the therapy. To increase treatment efficacy, early diagnosis, more potent pharmacological agents, and more effective delivery systems are urgently needed. Nanotechnology has been extensively studied for melanoma treatment and diagnosis, to decrease drug resistance, increase therapeutic efficacy, and reduce side effects. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the development of various nanoparticles for melanoma treatment and diagnosis. Several common nanoparticles, including liposome, polymersomes, dendrimers, carbon-based nanoparticles, and human albumin, have been used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents, and small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) against signaling molecules have also been tested for the treatment of melanoma. Indeed, several nanoparticle-delivered drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and are currently in clinical trials.

Preliminary analysis to reduce false positives ? Molecular Ecology, 11, (9), 1855 - 1864 Improved winter hardiness {{is an important}} breeding objective in the forage grass Lolium perenne. This is a complex trait with several components, including the ability to survive and grow at low temperature, to acclimate to cold, tolerate wind, snow cover and ice encasement. Marker-assisted selection {{has the potential to}} increase the efficiency of breeding for improved cold tolerance. Here we describe a genecological approach to identifying molecular markers that are associated with adaptation to low winter temperatures. AFLP was used to assess the genetic diversity in 29 wild populations of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) representing a pan-European temperature cline in terms of their geographical origin. A further 18 populations from a temperature cline in Bulgaria were also analysed. In addition, two varieties and five populations representing parents of mapping families currently in use at IGER were included in the analysis. Principal coordinate (PCoA) and cluster analyses of the molecular marker data showed that the Bulgarian altitude cline populations could be distinguished clearly from the other populations. Two regression analyses were carried out; one to identify AFLP markers that correlated in frequency with low mean January temperature of the geographical origin of the population, and another to identify AFLP markers correlating in frequency with the cold tolerance phenotype of the populations, as determined by LT 50 values in freezing tests. In the first analysis six AFLP markers showed significant type II trends with mean January temperature, and in the second analysis 28 bands had a significant univariate relationship with the LT 50 value of the accessions. In steps 2 and 3 of the stepwise analysis a further 4 and 5 bands, respectively, improved the fit significantly.

40|$|Minuartia verna (L.) Hiern and Thiaspi alpestre L. are {{recognized}} as relict elements of a preglacial montane flora in the British Isles and, as such, display a markedly disjunct distribution pattern. Their present-day distribution shows a close association with metalliferous mine workings, particularly in the Pennines, where both species have become prominent components of the flora of calcareous lead mine wastes. By comparison with M. verna, T. alpestre is more restricted in its distribution and is a rarer species. The work reported in this thesis attempted to provide an explanation for this pattern of distribution in the southern Pennines {{on the basis of}} comparative studies of the autecology and <b>genecology</b> of the species, their population biology and dynamics in the field and their responses to competition from other species. Both field and laboratory studies confirmed that the two species were highly tolerant of the heavy metals lead, zinc and cadmium. Short- and long-term solution culture experiments on tolerance and uptake of these heavy metals by a range of populations of both species are reported. Tolerance to other toxic metals was also investigated. T. alpestre showed superior tolerance to M. verna in these experiments, and emerged as a metal-accumulating species. M. verna by contrast, operated some degree of metal exclusion, but metal uptake and distribution differed for the various metals in both species and seasonally. Differences in metal tolerance and uptake characteristics alone could not explain the different local distribution patterns in the field, as sites of similar metal status are colonized by both the two species together and by M. verna alone. A study of inter-population variation in morphological characters showed considerable genetically-based variation in both species. M. verna was however more variable. Some of the variation detected was interpreted as being ecotypic in origin. The contrasting breeding of the two species and their seed biology are considered to be major factors in explaining the present-day distributions of the two species. The tendency for inbreeding in T. alpestre has severely limited its genetic variability within populations and potential for spread. Seedling mortality of both species in their natural habitats is very high, and survival can be related to early shelter effects of neighbouring plants. Both species, however, emerge as weak competitors as predicted from their preference for open habitats with much more bare ground. The relevance of these studies to the interpretation of the present-day global distribution of the two species and their evolutionary biology is discussed...|$|E
