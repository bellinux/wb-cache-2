40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of literary sources determined by technological factors influence on the quality of foil stamping and defects of the prints, which arise in case of foil stamping. The main managed (variables) the factors of influence {{on the quality of the}} process of embossing was selected temperature stamping, pressure and time of contact the <b>embossing</b> <b>plate</b> with substrate. Experimental research of the quality of embossing were carried out on samples of the natural and artificial leather. For controlled indicators were selected coating ability to print and the sharpness of boundaries of the image on the printout. The developed method of determining the coating ability to print based on the use of computers and modern software and hardware processing. On the results of the experiment developed an algorithm for the quantitative assessment of the coating ability to print in the software of Photoshop CS 2. On {{the basis of}} the experimental data are constructed graphics depending on the influence of the temperature of <b>embossing</b> <b>plate</b> on the coating ability to print at a pressure of 1700 and 2000 N; constructed graphics depending the sharpness of boundaries of the prints from the contact time of the <b>embossing</b> <b>plate</b> with a substrate in various temperature modes. According to the researches, recommendations are given the choice of a technological mode of embossing process to ensure optimum print quality. ? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ?????? ???????? ????????. ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ???? ? ??????????? ???? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ????????...|$|R

As on the Liberty base, the serial numbers were <b>embossed</b> onto the <b>plate,</b> but unlike on the Liberty base, all vanity plates, most specialty plates, and many non-passenger plates had screened serial numbers. Renewing registrants were given the option to keep their previous registration number on a new set of plates, for a one-time fee. Many took this option, and received <b>embossed</b> <b>plates</b> with old standard-issue numbers (not in the ABC-1234 format).|$|R

The heated lamination press has the Dufex <b>embossing</b> <b>plate</b> on its upper platen, which has been engraved with 'lenses' at different angles, designed to match the artwork and reflect light at different intensities depending on angle of view.|$|R

2500|$|Typically, the {{registration}} number is embossed – or, more rarely, impressed – onto the license plate. Other identifying information, such as {{the name of the}} issuing jurisdiction and the vehicle class, can be either surface-printed or embossed; Virginia, for example, does the former for passenger cars and the latter for most non-passenger vehicles. [...] However, it is increasingly common in the U.S. for {{the registration}} number to be surface-printed using digital printing technology. [...] Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington do so only for certain types of license plates, such as vanity plates and special issues; Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia have switched to the so-called [...] "flat plate" [...] technology for all their license plates. Nevada formerly issued flat plates but has returned to making <b>embossed</b> <b>plates.</b> Delaware license plates have not been embossed for several decades. Wyoming normally issues flat plates but also issues <b>embossed</b> license <b>plates</b> for an extra fee.|$|R

50|$|Even before 1920, {{some states}} had adopted the {{technique}} of <b>embossing</b> the metal <b>plates</b> with raised lettering and numbering, without porcelain, and applying paint all over the plate, directly onto the metal. Minnesota introduced some licence plates during this period with three different years <b>embossed</b> into the <b>plate,</b> so that the plates were valid for three consecutive years (e.g., 1918, 1919, and 1920).|$|R

Several other states, such as Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, produce a flat licence plate only for certain plates, such as personalized license plates and special interest plates.

50|$|Several Etruscan shields {{have been}} {{recovered}} from Etruscan grave sites. The shields are traditionally decorated bronze circular disks measuring around a yard across. Earlier Etruscan shields are flat and later examples have a slightly convex curve across {{the body of the}} shield. The later styles bear close resemblance to contemporary Greek models. There are several helmet designs found at Etruscan sites, the most distinctively Etruscan being the so-called “crested helm” variety. The crest is fashioned by joining two <b>embossed</b> <b>plates</b> (or laminae) into a high peak pointed crest. The high crest is frequently embossed with decoration. In addition to the Crested Helm a number of other varieties of helms have been found in Etruscan tombs. Often the design is a semi-spherical cap, with no decoration or with appliques. Another variation to the common semispherical cap is cheek guards attached by hinges.|$|R
