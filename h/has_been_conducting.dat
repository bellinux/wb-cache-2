5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid {{sturgeon}} in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable.

Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)—a Navajo man capable of translating the files—Mulder is shown a box-car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. He is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen.

Musicologist Stephen Rose terms the Cantiones [...] "the composer's [...] "most impassioned pieces" [...] and notes: [...] "They set first-person devotional texts to avant-garde madrigalism", evoking the crucifixion by extreme harmonies and [...] "joy in Christ by dance rhythms".|$|E

He noted {{that they are not}} materialistic or looking for power, but just desire to acknowledge their love for each other and stay close in their friendship. An example he mentioned was how Ruth tries to seek redemption by attempting to set right a big mistake she had made. What he found the most moving aspect of the film was the [...] "graceful place of acceptance that Kathy comes to at the end". Child actors Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe play the younger versions of Never Let Me Gos three lead actors. Hawkins, who co-starred with Mulligan in An Education, had a supporting role as Miss Lucy, who is a teacher at an isolated English boarding school where the students slowly become {{aware of the fact that}} they are feared by people in the outside world. Charlotte Rampling portrays Miss Emily, a schoolmaster who presides over the orphanage at Hailsham. Richard was cast as an administrator, who is known as Madame.

500|$|The Doctor {{dismisses the}} {{possibility}} that these are ghosts and conducts an experiment {{with the help of}} the TARDIS. He attempts to trap a ghost and determines that they are not ghosts but are impressions of something forcing its way into this universe. The Doctor tracks the signal back and uses the TARDIS to travel there, arriving at the Torchwood Institute. The Doctor introduces himself and tells everyone that Jackie is Rose, his companion. They are taken by soldiers to see Torchwood's current director Yvonne Hartman, while the TARDIS is impounded with Rose inside. Ms. Hartman shows the Doctor the source of the ghost energy, an invisible breach in the universe through which a mysterious spherical object has arrived. The Doctor inspects the sphere, declaring it to be a [...] "Void ship"—which, according to him, is impossible. It is designed to exist in the space between universes, a nothingness called the Void. The ship is completely undetectable by all scientific instruments. Torchwood has no explanation for what the sphere is or how it got there, but they claim responsibility for the ghosts. Torchwood <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducting</b> experiments on the breach, forcing it open in an attempt to harness it as a source of energy. Ms. Hartman also reveals to the Doctor that his encounter with Queen Victoria in [...] "Tooth and Claw" [...] made him an enemy of the state and was the catalyst for the creation of Torchwood. Unbeknownst to all at this point, an unseen party has infiltrated the institute and has been successful in subverting three Torchwood staff.|$|E
500|$|... : Samus {{receives}} a distress signal and follows it to a mysterious vessel named the Bottle Ship. There, she encounters {{a squad of}} Galactic Federation soldiers, including her friend Anthony Higgs and her former superior officer Adam Malkovich. They {{find out that the}} director of the ship, Madeline Bergman, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducting</b> research on illegal bioweapons for the Federation. Eventually, Samus finds a survivor who claims to be Madeline Bergman, but is later revealed to be an android with an artificial intelligence duplicating that of Mother Brain, so that the bioweapon Metroids can be telepathically controlled. The Federation soldiers are mysteriously killed by a secret assassin among their ranks. Samus refers to this assassin as [...] "the Deleter". His or her identity is never explicitly revealed in-game, but the Deleter is thought to be James Pierce for a few evidential reasons. Samus later discovers that these weapons are Metroids that have been genetically modified to remove their weakness to cold, making them virtually indestructible. Adam sacrifices himself to detach Sector Zero, the Metroid breeding area, from the main ship and activate its self-destruct sequence. After defeating a Queen Metroid, Samus finds the real Madeline Bergman, who tells her the truth about the android she found earlier. The artificial intelligence, named MB, took on a human shape to build an ideal relationship with the Metroids, similar to the one Samus had with the Metroid hatchling (Super Metroid). After developing emotions, MB revolted, telepathically ordering the cloned Zebesian life forms on the ship to attack their captors. MB appears and attacks Samus and Madeline, but is stopped when Galactic Federation reinforcements show up, led by Anthony, the only surviving member of the original squad. [...] Samus, Anthony and Madeline all escape on Samus's gunship. In an optional epilogue, Samus returns to retrieve [...] "something irreplaceable:" [...] Adam's helmet.|$|E

500|$|The Justice League {{made its}} first {{official}} team appearance in the season six episode [...] "Justice". Here, Clark discovers that Oliver has also met Bart, Arthur, and Victor, {{and that he has}} organized them into a team of superheroes focused on stopping those who believe that they are above the law. Oliver reveals that Lex <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducting</b> experiments on people who developed special abilities thanks to exposure to kryptonite. Clark and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) work alongside the team to dismantle Lex's local experimental facility, known as Level 33.1, and after destroying the building, Oliver and his team leave Smallville to seek out Lex's other facilities around the world. Oliver asks Clark to become a full fledged member of the team, but Clark turns Oliver down explaining that he is not ready to do that. In the season seven episode [...] "Siren", Lex puts a bounty on Oliver and his team, convincing the vigilante Dinah Lance (Alaina Huffman), who goes by the name [...] "Black Canary" [...] and has the ability to emit an ultrasonic sound wave with a single scream, that these individuals are terrorists. In the end, Clark proves to Dinah that Lex lied to her, so she decides to join Oliver's team. In the season eight premiere, the Justice League set out to find Clark, who has disappeared following the destruction of his Fortress of Solitude in the previous season's finale. Clark is eventually found, but the true identities of the League's members are compromised, so the team decides to disband until it is safe again for them to work together. In the season eight episode [...] "Hex", Oliver reforms his team and gives Chloe the role of [...] "Watchtower". In that season's finale, it is revealed that the League has been tracking the genetically engineered Kryptonian known as Doomsday. Oliver tries to convince Clark to kill the creature, but Clark refuses and instead informs Dinah and Bart that Oliver murdered Lex, while simultaneously kicking Oliver off of the team. Using subterfuge, Dinah and Bart betray Clark, revealing that they were in agreement with Oliver's plan all along, and capture Doomsday to force Clark into a fight. Their plan backfires, and Doomsday injures all of them during his escape. In the end, Clark defeats the creature by burying him a mile underground, and Oliver and his team apologize for not following Clark's plan from the start. The League leaves Metropolis afterward, feeling {{responsible for the death of}} Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), who was killed after Doomsday escaped. In response, Chloe turns a Metropolis clock tower, which is also the tallest building in the city, into the Watchtower base with the hope that the team will one day return home. The team eventually reforms off screen, and assists Clark in hunting down other Kryptonians who are attempting to take over the Earth. Starting with the ninth episode of the final season, [...] "Patriot", the Justice League are alerted to the arrival of Darkseid, and for the rest of the season they attempt to stop him before he destroys Earth. Subsequent episodes [...] "Dominion" [...] and [...] "Prophecy" [...] also imply that Michael Carter (Booster Gold) and Kara have joined the team.|$|E
