5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena,</b> while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how civil society organizations (CSOs) perform and influence public arenas. The focus {{of this paper is}} the transformative scope of social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOsin two <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> <b>in</b> Brazil: <b>the</b> fight against electoral corruption and the protection of children and adolescents? rights. The research consisted of three stages: 1) controversy mapping {{to understand}} <b>the</b> configuration ofthese <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> and compare <b>the</b> trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> problems studied; 2) observation of the ?field of experience? of some CSOs that perform in these arenas; and 3) analysis of ?political grammars? produced in public arenas, connecting them to the performance of the CSOs analysed. The results reveal how social innovation emerges, develops and is disseminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> studied and highlights the similarities and differences between the two cases, discussing the practices and role of CSOs in these processes. As conclusions, the study indicates that social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOs are influenced by and have an effect on <b>the</b> ?political culture? <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arenas.</b> Additionally, this work states that the regime of CSOs? engagement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sphere and their performance have consequences in terms of influence on social and political changes. In the cases studied, when CSOs go beyond the logic of coproduction of public services and engage in ?public inquiry? processes, their capacity to inspire social transformation seems to be enhanced...|$|R

Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E

500|$|Musical {{performance}} in the Highlands took on a distinctly political and educative role through the hira gasy (hira: song; gasy: Malagasy).

[...] While {{the origins of the}} hira gasy are uncertain, oral history attributes its modern form to 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina, who reportedly employed musicians to gather the public together for royal speeches and announcements (kabary) and to entertain them as they labored on public works projects such as building dikes to irrigate the rice paddies surrounding Antananarivo.

The controversy focuses on whether [...] "forbidding women to sing is an insulting act of unacceptable discrimination, or a gesture of sensitivity and consideration to Orthodox Jewish men who believe that listening to a woman’s singing voice is, for them, a violation of religious law.
