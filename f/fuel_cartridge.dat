50|$|In the end, Price's {{concerns}} came to pass. So many cartridges {{missed the}} water channel {{that it became}} routine for staff {{to walk through the}} chimney ductwork with shovels and scoop the cartridges back into the water. On other occasions, <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges</b> became stuck in the channels and burst open while still in the core. In spite of these precautions and the stack filters, scientist Frank Leslie had discovered radioactivity around the site and the village, but this information was kept secret, even from the staff at the station.|$|R

Another water-activated battery had been invented by Susumu Suzuki of Total System Conductor. Aluminium anodes are used on many water-activated batteries designed for use with salt water such as seawater. The HydroPak uses water-activated disposable fuel cartridges {{as an alternative to}} lead acid battery packs and portable generators. It uses water added to sodium borohydride which releases hydrogen fuel for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. It can be re-charged simply by replacing the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge</b> rather than the lengthy recharging that other batteries require, however the cartridges cost $20 each.|$|E
50|$|The reactor has {{basically}} a loop type configuration and a reactor container of 2 m in diameter, 6.5 m deep and weighs about 7.6 tons.This RAPID concept has neither diagrid nor {{core support structure}} since they are integrated in a fuel cartridge.The simple reactor container would make the most important In-Service Inspection (ISI) easier. An ISI can be conducted for each refueling.The reactor {{is designed to be}} installed below grade so that the ground provides the necessary shielding. Separate electromagnetic pumps and the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge</b> are connected by the connecting tubes. The reactor subsystem is characterized by the RAPID refueling concept to eliminate conventional fuel handling systems. This gives a substantial reactor block mass savings of 60% over comparable liquid metal cooled fast reactor systems.|$|E
50|$|Burn-up {{compensation}} is achieved automatically by the LEMs, achieving 80% of the nominal {{power at the}} end-of-life of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This “liquid control rod” can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life.Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary coolant flow rate. Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary coolant flow rate due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers. The lower chamber, within the active core, has a 95% enriched Li6 reservoir, while the upper chamber is a vacuum prior to reactor startup.Reactor startup can be done automatically if the primary coolant temperature reaches its standby temperature. Coolant heating {{can be achieved by}} heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot standby temperature (approximately 780 °C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase.It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient negative reactivity feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot standby temperature of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs.The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight temperature deviation of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.|$|E
50|$|Operators were {{unsure what}} to do about the fire. First they tried to blow the flames out by running the fans at maximum speed, but this fed the flames. Tom Hughes and his {{colleague}} had already created a fire break by ejecting some undamaged <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges</b> from around the blaze, and Tom Tuohy suggested trying to eject some from the heart of the fire by bludgeoning the melted cartridges through the reactor and into the cooling pond behind it with scaffolding poles. This proved impossible and the fuel rods refused to budge, no matter how much force was applied. The poles were withdrawn with their ends red hot; one returned dripping molten metal. Hughes knew this had to be molten irradiated uranium, causing serious radiation problems on the charge hoist itself.|$|R
50|$|When {{their first}} H-bomb test failed, the {{decision}} was made to build a large fusion-boosted-fission weapon instead. This required huge quantities of tritium, five times as much, and it had to be produced as rapidly as possible as the test deadlines approached. To boost the production rates, they used a trick that had been successful in increasing plutonium production in the past; by reducing the size of the cooling fins on the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges,</b> the temperature of the fuel loads increased, which caused a small but useful increase in neutron enrichment rates. This time they also took advantage of the smaller fins by building larger interiors in the <b>cartridges,</b> allowing more <b>fuel</b> in each one. These changes triggered further warnings from the technical staff, which were again brushed aside. Christopher Hinton, Windscale's director, left in frustration.|$|R
50|$|There was now {{no doubt}} that the reactor was on fire, and had been for almost 48 hours. Reactor Manager Tom Tuohy donned full {{protective}} equipment and breathing apparatus and scaled the 80-foot ladder {{to the top of the}} reactor building, where he stood atop the reactor lid to examine the rear of the reactor, the discharge face. Here he reported a dull red luminescence visible, lighting up the void between the back of the reactor and the rear containment. Red hot <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges</b> were glowing in the fuel channels on the discharge face. He returned to the reactor upper containment several times throughout the incident, at the height of which a fierce conflagration was raging from the discharge face and playing on the back of the reinforced concrete containment — concrete whose specifications required that it be kept below a certain temperature to prevent its collapse.|$|R
40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has {{monitored}} its releases to {{the environment}} {{since its inception in}} 1947. From 1962 to 1966 and from 1971 to the present, annual reports,were published that recorded the emissions and releases {{to the environment}} from Laboratory operations. In 1998, a report was written to summarize the environmental data for the years 1967 to 1970. One of the purposes of the current report is to complete BNL's environmental history by covering the period from 1948 through 1961. The activities in 1947 were primarily organizational and there is no information on the use of radiation at the Laboratory before 1948. An additional objective of this report is to provide environmental data to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The report does not provide an estimate of the doses associated with BNL operations. The report is comprised of two parts. The first part is a summary of emissions, releases, and environmental monitoring information including a discussion of the uncertainties in these data. Part two contains the detailed information on the approach taken to estimate the releases from the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge</b> failures at the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor (BGRR). A series of appendices present more detailed information on these events in tabular form. The approach in this report is to be reasonable, conservative, (pessimistic), and transparent in estimating releases from <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge</b> ruptures. Clearly, reactor stack monitoring records and more extensive records would have greatly improved this effort, but in accordance with Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Appendix 0230 Annex C- 9, many of the detailed records from this time were not retained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} characterization of an air-breathing microfluidic fuel cell with a stationary fuel reservoir above the anode replacing the continuous fuel stream. Unlike other air-breathing microfluidic designs, the fuel is not {{in direct contact with}} electrolyte stream allowing the use of high fuel concentration. In addition, Ohmic losses are minimal because of the low anode-to-cathode spacing. Since the fuel passes through the catalyst layer of the anode, the conventional depletion boundary layer does not form. Improved mass transport compared to previous microfluidic designs is obtained because of a supply of a uniform fuel concentration over the anode and efficient bubble removal from the anode active sites. For practical applications, the fuel reservoir can be replaced by a pressurized <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The pressure is optimized according to the fuel concentration and the power density.

40|$|ABSTRACT Project Title: Recovery Act: Advanced Direct Methanol Fuel Cell for Mobile Computing PROJECT OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to advance portable fuel cell system technology towards the commercial targets of power density, energy density and lifetime. These targets were laid out in the DOE’s R&D roadmap to develop an advanced direct methanol fuel cell power supply that meets commercial entry requirements. Such a power supply will enable mobile computers to operate non-stop, unplugged from the wall power outlet, by using the high energy density of methanol fuel contained in a replaceable <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Specifically this project focused on balance-of-plant component integration and miniaturization, as well as extensive component, subassembly and integrated system durability and validation testing. This design has resulted in a pre-production power supply design and a prototype that meet the rigorous demands of consumer electronic applications. PROJECT TASKS The proposed work plan was designed to meet the project objectives, which corresponded directly with the objectives outlined in the Funding Opportunity Announcement: To engineer the fuel cell balance-of-plant and packaging {{to meet the needs of}} consumer electronic systems, specifically at power levels required for mobile computing. UNF used existing balance-of-plant component technologies developed under its current US Army CERDEC project, as well as a previous DOE project completed by PolyFuel, to further refine them to both miniaturize and integrate their functionality to increase the system power density and energy density. Benefits of UNF’s novel passive water recycling MEA (membrane electrode assembly) and the simplified system architecture it enabled formed the foundation of the design approach. The package design was hardened to address orientation independence, shock, vibration, and environmental requirements. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cartridge</b> and fuel subsystems were improved to ensure effective fuel containment. PROJECT OVERVIEW The University of North Florida (UNF), with project partner the University of Florida, recently completed the Department of Energy (DOE) project entitled “Advanced Direct Methanol Fuel Cell for Mobile Computing”. The primary {{objective of}} the project was to advance portable fuel cell system technology towards the commercial targets as laid out in the DOE R&D roadmap by developing a 20 -watt, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), portable power supply based on the UNF innovative “passive water recovery” MEA. Extensive component, sub-system, and system development and testing was undertaken to meet the rigorous demands of the consumer electronic application. Numerous brassboard (nonpackaged) systems were developed to optimize the integration process and facilitating control algorithm development. The culmination of the development effort was a fully-integrated, DMFC, power supply (referred to as DP 4). The project goals were 40 W/kg for specific power, 55 W/l for power density, and 575 Whr/l for energy density. It should be noted that the specific power and power density were for the power section only, and did not include the hybrid battery. The energy density is based on three, 200 ml, fuel cartridges, and also did not include the hybrid battery. The results show that the DP 4 system configured without the methanol concentration sensor exceeded all performance goals, achieving 41. 5 W/kg for specific power, 55. 3 W/l for power density, and 623 Whr/l for energy density. During the project, the DOE revised its technical targets, and the definition of many of these targets, for the portable power application. With this revision, specific power, power density, specific energy (Whr/kg), and energy density are based on the total system, including fuel tank, fuel, and hybridization battery. Fuel capacity is not defined, but the same value is required for all calculations. Test data showed that the DP 4 exceeded all 2011 Technical Status values; for example, the DP 4 energy density was 373 Whr/l versus the DOE 2011 status of 200 Whr/l. For the DOE 2013 Technical Goals, the operation time was increased from 10 hours to 14. 3 hours. Under these conditions, the DP 4 closely approached or surpassed the technical targets; for example, the DP 4 achieved 468 Whr/l versus the goal of 500 Whr/l. Thus, UNF has successfully met the project goals. A fully-operational, 20 -watt DMFC power supply was developed based on the UNF passive water recovery MEA. The power supply meets the project performance goals and advances portable power technology towards the commercialization targets set by the DOE...|$|E
5000|$|During construction, Terence Price, one of {{the many}} {{physicists}} working on the project, began to consider what would happen if {{one of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges</b> being pushed out the back of the core were to break open. This could happen, for example, if a new cartridge being inserted was pushed too hard, causing the one {{at the back of the}} channel to fall past the relatively narrow water channel and strike the floor behind it. In that event, the hot uranium could catch fire, with the fine uranium oxide dust being blown up the chimney to escape. When he raised the issue at a meeting and suggested that filters be added to the chimneys, the concern was dismissed as being too difficult to deal with and was not even recorded in the minutes. Sir John Cockcroft, leading the project team, was alarmed enough to order that filters be installed, which required them to be constructed on the ground while the chimneys were still being built, and then winched into position at the top once the chimney's concrete had set. These became known as [...] "Cockcroft's Folly" [...] by workers and engineers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{core of the}} {{reactors}} consisted of a large block of graphite with horizontal channels drilled through it for the <b>fuel</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Each cartridge consisted of a uranium rod about 30 cm long encased in an aluminium canister {{to protect it from}} the air, as uranium becomes highly reactive when hot and can catch fire. The cartridge was finned, allowing heat exchange with the environment to cool the fuel rods while they were in the reactor. Rods were pushed {{in the front of the}} core, the [...] "charge face", with new rods being added at a calculated rate. This pushed the other cartridges in the channel towards the rear of the reactor, eventually causing them to fall out the back, the [...] "discharge face", into a water filled channel where they cooled and could be collected. The chain reaction in the core converted the uranium into a variety of isotopes, including some plutonium, which was separated from the other materials using chemical processing. As this plutonium was intended for weapons purposes, the burnup of the fuel would have been kept low to reduce production of the heavier plutonium isotopes (240Pu, 241Pu etc.).|$|R
50|$|Agni-I is {{a single}} stage, solid fuel, road and rail mobile, medium-range {{ballistic}} missile (MRBM). The need for the Agni-I was felt after the Kargil war with Pakistan. It took DRDO 15 months to develop the Agni-I after having completed Agni-II development. It is propelled by solid fuel. Maneuvering RV body-lift aerodynamics give it the ability to correct trajectory errors and reduce thermal stresses. The MRV has a velocity correction package to correct launch trajectory variances. Some Agni RV versions use a set of solid <b>fueled</b> thruster <b>cartridges</b> of predetermined impulse, allowing the onboard guidance controller to trim velocity, using discrete combination of impulse quanta along the desired spatial orientation. The 15 metre tall Agni-1 missile, weighing about 12 tonnes, is capable of carrying both conventional as well as nuclear warheads of 1,000 kg.Calculations suggest a distance of 1500 km can, theoretically, be reached if the missile were {{to be made of}} composites & carrying a lesser mass of payload.|$|R
50|$|As {{a variant}} of the RAPID (Refueling by All Pins Integrated Design) fast reactor concept, it can be refueled in a quick and simple manner.Essential for this feature is that the reactor core {{consists}} of an Integrated Fuel Assembly (IFA) instead of conventional fuel subassemblies.This small core has 2700 fuel elements (pins) combined together by the IFA, consisting of a core support grid and several spacer grids, and are assembled into a <b>fuel</b> cartridge.This <b>cartridge</b> can be replaced as a unit. The reactor can be operated without refueling for up to 10 years (80% nominal power). The reactor has no control rods.To achieve fully automated operation the reactor relies on various reactivity control systems: Lithium Expansion Module (LEM), Lithium Injection Module (LIM) and Lithium Release Module (LRM).LEM serves for inherent reactivity feedback, LIM serves for inherent ultimate shutdown, and LRM serves for automated reactor startup. These passive systems help to mitigate the effects of fuel depletion, allowing a long fuel life. The bias factors were used to determine the number of LEM and LIM needed in the core to achieve fully automated operation.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a low-field NMR relaxometry study {{of water and}} aviation turbine fuel (jet fuel) in contact with samples of fibrous media removed from an unused aviation <b>fuel</b> filter <b>cartridge.</b> This media was studied both in its as-received state and after modifying its wettability. The interaction of liquid droplets with fibers {{is the basis for}} fibrous coalescence widely used industrially to separate different types of liquid-liquid dispersion. Here, we are specifically concerned with interactions that potentially occur during the removal of entrained water from jet fuels, an application that is of particular importance on safety grounds, primarily to prevent ice formation in aircraft fuel tanks which could otherwise lead to fuel-line filter blockage and fuel starvation to the engines. Jet fuel is treated using various filtration systems, including cartridge-type microfilters and filter-coalescers, at different points between refinery and aircraft fuel tank in order to remove dirt (particulates) and water and ensure that contamination levels always meet the required specifications. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to apply proton NMR relaxometry to provide insight into the water coalescence process, specifically by probing water environments on fibrous media. On the basis of T 2 (spin-spin) relaxation distributions, it has been confirmed that the water environments depend on the media wettability, with three environments being identified: fiber surface adsorbed water; inter-fiber absorbed water; and unassociated (largely bulk) water. The use of such NMR techniques may therefore offer potential for monitoring or improving filter-coalescer performance...|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} most {{portable}} gas cartridge stoves {{is similar to}} that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the <b>fuel</b> tank or <b>cartridge</b> contains a liquefied gas - typically butane, propane or a mixture of hydrocarbons - that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate. There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove's base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or pipe. Single burner propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove. Butane cartridges are almost exclusively manufactured in South Korea with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.|$|R
