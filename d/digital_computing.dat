There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and <b>digital</b> <b>computing.</b> For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of <b>digital</b> <b>computing</b> (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E

2500|$|The complex {{histories}} of computer science and computer engineering were shaped, {{in the first}} decades of <b>digital</b> <b>computing,</b> almost entirely by military funding. [...] Most of the basic component technologies for <b>digital</b> <b>computing</b> were developed through the course of the long-running Whirlwind-SAGE program to develop an automated radar shield. [...] Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies {{by the end of the}} 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility. [...] More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a Cold War military perspective. [...] Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience through the mind-computer analogy.|$|E

2500|$|Quantum {{computing}} studies computation systems (quantum computers) {{that make}} direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers {{are different from}} binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common <b>digital</b> <b>computing</b> requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), {{each of which is}} always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. [...] The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of [...] and [...] Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985.

2500|$|World War II {{marked a}} massive {{increase}} in the military funding of science, particularly physics. [...] In addition to the Manhattan Project and the resulting atomic bomb, British and American work on radar was widespread and ultimately highly influential {{in the course of}} the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based proximity fuze. [...] Mathematical cryptography, meteorology, and rocket science were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline. [...] The technologies employed at the endjet aircraft, radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bombwere radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars. [...] The advent of the Cold War solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the United States and the Soviet Union, so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand. [...] Funding spread to the social sciences as well as the natural sciences, and whole new fields, such as <b>digital</b> <b>computing,</b> were born of military patronage. [...] Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American military-scientific complex remains in place.|$|E
