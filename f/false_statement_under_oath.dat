However, it was later revealed that Professor Brennan had been killed in a road accident in the United States in February 2003, and that Einfeld was aware of it. This was the basis for Einfeld's conviction for knowingly making a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The above statute {{provides}} for a fine and/or {{up to five years}} in prison as punishment. Within federal jurisdiction, statements made in two broad categories of judicial proceedings may qualify as perjurious: 1) Federal official proceedings, and 2) Federal Court or Grand Jury proceedings. A third type of perjury entails the procurement of perjurious statements from another person. More generally, the statement must occur in the [...] "course of justice," [...] but this definition leaves room open for interpretation. One particularly precarious aspect of this phrasing is that it entails knowledge of the accused person’s perception of the truthful nature of events and not necessarily the actual truth of those events. It is important to note the distinction here, between giving a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> and merely misstating a fact accidentally, though this distinction can be especially difficult to discern in court of law.|$|E

On 26 November 2008 Einfeld's commission as a Queen's Counsel was revoked. On 20 March 2009, Einfeld was sentenced to three years in prison for knowingly making a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> and for attempting to pervert the course of justice, with a non-parole period of two years. Supreme Court Justice Bruce James found Einfeld had committed [...] "deliberate, premeditated perjury" [...] that was [...] "part of planned criminal activity".

5000|$|On January 17, 2008 Fort Lee Police {{officers}} arrested Armen Hovsepian and {{his father}} Gagik Hovsepian for the 2007 death of Jason Ray. Jason Ray was the mascot for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels basketball team, and was staying {{at a hotel in}} Fort Lee for the NCAA tournament. On March 23, 2007 Jason Ray was walking along Route 4 returning to his hotel when he was struck by a vehicle reportedly driven by Gagik Hovsepian. Jason Ray was transported to Hackensack University Medical Center where he was later pronounced dead. The Fort Lee Police Department investigated the collision at the scene, and initially it appeared to be accidental. A witness later came forth stating that Armen Hovsepian was driving the vehicle, not Gagik Hovsepian as was originally reported to the Fort Lee Police. After a thorough investigation that confirmed the witness's statement, Gagik Hovsepian was charged with hindering apprehension, obstructing the administration of law and making a <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> and is facing up to 18 moths in prison. Armen Hovsepian was charged with one count of driving while suspended in a fatal motor vehicle accident and hindering apprehension and is facing up to five years in prison. Jason Ray was an organ donor which resulted in saving the lives of four New Jersey men. Over 25 other people have received tissue from Jason Ray, and it is expected that up to 50 to 70 more people still may be helped by Jason Ray's generosity. The New Jersey Sharing Network would annually give an award to an individual who helps to raise organ donor awareness. The award has since been renamed The Ray of Hope. Jason's parents Emmitt and Charlotte were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show telling the story of how Jason had touched so many lives with his gift of being an organ donor.|$|E

In a statement released by the Committee, Chaffetz said Koskinen [...] "failed {{to comply with a}} congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled.

40|$|Although it now covers {{more than}} court proceedings, the {{definition}} of perjury has not changed a great deal otherwise since the framing of the Constitution. Blackstone described it as "a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, {{to a person who}} swears wilfully, absolutely and falsely, in a matter material to the issue or point in question. " There are three general federal perjury laws. One, 18 U. S. C. 1621, outlaws presenting material <b>false</b> <b>statements</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> in federal official proceedings. A second, 18 U. S. C. 1623, bars presenting material <b>false</b> <b>statements</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> before or ancillary to federal court or grand jury proceedings. A third, 18 U. S. C. 1622 (subornation of perjury), prohibits inducing or procuring another to commit perjury in violation of either Section 1621 or Section 1623. In most cases, the courts abbreviate their description of the elements and state that to prove perjury under Section 1623 the government must establish that the defendant "(1) knowingly made a (2) false (3) material declaration (4) <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> (5) in a proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States. " The courts generally favor the encapsulation from United States v. Dunnigan to describe the elements of Section 1621 : "A witness testifying <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> or affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. " Section 1622 outlaws procuring or inducing another to commit perjury: "Whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both", 18 U. S. C. 1622. The <b>false</b> <b>statement</b> statute, 18 U. S. C. 1001, is closely akin to the perjury statutes. It outlaws <b>false</b> <b>statements</b> in any matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency or department, a kind of perjury with oath prohibition.

The seven-page document, signed by Finneran on January 3, 2007, states, [...] "Defendant expressly and unequivocally admits that he committed the crime so charged in the indictment, {{and that he is}} in fact guilty of the offense so charged in the indictment." [...] Finneran faced 16 to 21 months in prison if he was convicted on all counts stemming from criminal charges that he misrepresented his role {{in the creation of a}} legislative redistricting map that diluted the clout of minority voters. Finneran lost his $30,000-a-year pension after his plea. A decision in 2006 by the state Supreme Judicial Court permitted a pension to be revoked in a similar case of breach of public trust. His attorney, Richard Egbert, has said Finneran never claimed he was totally uninvolved in the redistricting process and that he acknowledged in his testimony having about [...] "half a dozen" [...] conversations with leaders of the redistricting committee.|$|R
