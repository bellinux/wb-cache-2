40|$|Mining image content {{means to}} extract image hidden patterns, {{identify}} image data relationships and, thus, gather novel meaningful knowledge {{pertinent to the}} specific domain images belong to. Research {{in the field is}} still in its early stages, although it relies on rather assessed disciplines such as Computer Vision, Image Processing, Image Retrieval, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The key importance that nowadays characterizes imagebased tasks, i. e., tasks that relies on the management, analysis and interpretation of image content, is plainly perceivable in almost all the strategic social, scientific and industrial fields: an imaging investigation is a fundamental step of the medical diagnosis processes; in situ images are acquired for industrial inspection; biometric images are used in surveillance or forensic sciences; georeferenced imagery are gathered and employed in fields such as aerospace, defence, geophysics, intelligence, oceanography, and so forth. Furthermore, advances in image acquisition and management technologies have fuelled the rapid growth of large and rich image collections. These can reveal meaningful information if suitably processed and exploited. Research in mining image content is just devoted to reach this goal. Image Mining {{can be seen as the}} summa and advancement of several processing procedures that are usually applied in image analysis. It requires a long chain that starts with image acquisition and storage, evolves through image processing, image content extraction and suitable representation, image retrieval and indexing, and ends up with the identification of meaningful patterns, thus allowing the production of novel knowledge relevant to the task to be solved. The fundamental challenge in Image Mining is to determine how low‐level information contained in a raw image or image sequence can be processed to identify high‐level information, and relationships among imagery data, as well as with other contextual data. This dissertation reports the investigation that was carried out in the field of Image Mining by facing several issues related to the different steps of the chain. Theoretical investigations were grounded into the development of innovative methods for tackling all the phases of the image mining process, from image content extraction, representation and browsing, to data mining for the generation of novel knowledge. Such methods were finally integrated into a framework able to support the main image mining functionalities, ranging from image storage to novel knowledge discovery.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the audit {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of the design and conduct of the third and fourth funding rounds of the Regional Development Australia Fund. The scope of the audit included the processes by which proposals were sought and assessed and successful projects were approved for funding. The audit criteria reflected the financial and grants administration frameworks then in effect, including the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines (CGGs), as well as ANAO’s grants administration Better Practice Guide. Overall conclusion The Regional Development Australia Fund (RDAF) was introduced following the 2010 election as part of a $ 1. 4  billion commitment to support the infrastructure needs and economic growth of regional Australia. The third and fourth RDAF funding rounds were conducted between October 2012 and June 2013. There was significant interest in the opportunity to compete for Australian Government funding, with more than 900 expressions of interest received, seeking over $ 2. 5  billion in funding compared with the $ 225  million that was announced as being available. As it eventuated, more than $ 226  million in grant funding was awarded across the two rounds to support 121 capital infrastructure projects. The award of funding was undertaken through a two-stage application process that initially involved the 55 Regional Development Australia (RDA) committees shortlisting expressions of interest and assigning a priority to each project in their region, prior to full applications being submitted to the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport (DRALGAS, or ‘the department’). Those applications were then assessed by the department, which included assigning each <b>eligible</b> <b>application</b> a rating against each selection criterion. Improvements in the quality of the department’s assessment work, and of its application lodgement processes, were evident. An advisory panel, whose five members were selected for their experience, knowledge and expertise on regional Australia, was responsible for assessing the eligible applications and providing funding recommendations to the then Minister for Regional Services, Local Communities and Territories. The Minister made her funding decisions in May 2013 for round three and over May and June 2013 for round four. The assessment and selection process as it was described in the program guidelines reflected a sound approach. However, in the manner implemented, the stages were not well integrated in that each step informed the next in only a limited way. As a result, there was not a clear trail through the assessment stages to demonstrate that the projects awarded funding were those that had the greatest merit in terms of the published program guidelines. In particular: 	the order of regional priority allocated to projects by the RDA committees was not used by the department or the panel at any point in the assessment of applications, and was not provided to the Minister to inform her decision-making; 	the panel categorised applications as ‘recommended’, ‘suitable’ and ‘not recommended’, but its categorisation was not supported by a documented assessment, by the panel, of the merits of each <b>eligible</b> <b>application</b> in terms of the published selection criteria. Rather, the panel advised ANAO that it considered and applied the selection criteria ‘in their entirety’; 	the only recorded assessment of each <b>eligible</b> <b>application</b> against each of the published selection criteria was that undertaken by the department; however a third of the applications awarded the highest possible rating against each selection criterion by the department were assigned to the lowest merit category by the panel; 	 27  per cent of the applications approved by the Minister, representing 48  per cent of total funding awarded, had not been included by the panel in the ‘Recommended for Funding’ category (as the panel did not consider them to be of sufficient quality). These applications represented: - 15  per cent of approved round three applications (and 16  per cent of approved round three funding) categorised by the panel as other than ‘Recommended for Funding’, three quarters of which had been categorised as ‘Not Recommended for Funding’ with the remaining quarter classified as ‘Suitable for Funding’; and - 50  per cent of approved round four applications (involving 53  per cent of approved round four funding) categorised by the panel as other than ‘Recommended for Funding’. Two-thirds of these applications had been categorised as ‘Not Recommended for Funding’ with the other third categorised as ‘Suitable for Funding’; and 	 56  per cent of those applications awarded funding had been assessed by the department to not satisfactorily meet {{one or more of the}} selection criteria. The absence of alignment or a clear trail between the assessed merit of applications against the published selection criteria and the rounds three and four funding decisions was a similar situation to that observed in ANAO’s audit of the first RDAF funding round. This shows that the recommendations made in the first audit, agreed by the department, had not been implemented by the department, and inadequate attention was given to relevant aspects of the grants administration framework. Effectively implementing agreed recommendations (which often reflect ANAO’s experience of practices other departments have found to be beneficial) and closer adherence to identified principles of better practice grants administration are matters that warrant greater attention by the department. In light of the findings of this current audit, ANAO has made a further three recommendations to DIRD directed at: 	improving the efficiency of two-stage grant application processes; 	a more rigorous approach to assessing whether candidates for grant funding will provide value with public money; and 	improving the quality and clarity of advice provided to Ministers to inform their decisions about the relative merits of proposals competing for grant funding. A further similarity between the third and fourth RDAF rounds and the first round was that a relatively high proportion of approved projects had not been recommended for approval by the panel. In each of the four rounds, the panel recommended that funding be approved only for those applications it had included in the ‘Recommended for Funding’ category. This reflected the design of the program, where the three categories to be used by the panel (see paragraph  4) were intended to distinguish between the assessed relative merit of groups of applications. In this respect, the published operating procedures for the panel required that applications categorised as: 	‘Recommended for Funding’ have been assessed as meritorious, meeting the selection criteria to a high degree and having a strong positive impact on the region; 	‘Suitable for Funding’ have been assessed to meet the selection criteria and have a positive impact on the region but are considered to be not as strong as those categorised as ‘Recommended for Funding’; and 	‘Not Recommended for Funding’ have been assessed as not strong and to have no identifiable positive impact on the broader community. However, the Minister has informed the ANAO that: she had been advised by the department, and was always of the understanding, that projects in both the ‘Recommended for Funding’ and ‘Suitable for Funding’ categories were available for selection; in choosing projects from both categories she was complying with the program guidelines; and she would have reported to the Finance Minister her decisions to award funding to an application included in the ‘Suitable for Funding’ category if she had believed that the panel had not recommended them for funding. In this context, focusing solely on those applications approved for funding in the ‘Not Recommended for Funding’ category, the proportion of applications approved for funding against panel advice falls (from 27  per cent) but nevertheless remains significant (at 19  per cent of all applications approved, comprising 11  per cent of approved round three applications and 33  per cent of round four applications). In terms of the proportion of funding approved, 40  per cent ($ 90. 6  million) was awarded to applications categorised as ‘Not Recommended for Funding’ (comprising 11  per cent of the round three funding and 45  per cent of the round four funding awarded). ANAO sought advice from the department on whether officers responsible for briefing the Minister on the outcome of the funding rounds had provided such advice to the Minister. In response, the department outlined to ANAO that it had: briefed the Minister that rounds three and four involved discretionary grant funding; identified the applications the panel had recommended be awarded funding (being those in the ‘Recommended for Funding’ category); and advised her that she should review the list of projects recommended and satisfy herself as to the benefits of each project and that, should she disagree with the recommendations and choose other projects, then the reasons for these decisions should be recorded. Setting aside the different perspectives of the Minister and the department, the then Government’s guidelines for this program provided for the advisory panel to make the recommendations to the Minister as to those applications that should be awarded funding. Further, the grants administration framework has been designed to accommodate situations where decision‑makers do not accept the advice they receive. Amongst other things, it requires that the basis for funding decisions be recorded. However, the records of the reasons for funding decisions taken contrary to panel advice generally provided little insight as to their basis and made no reference to the published selection criteria. This situation was particularly significant given that such decisions were largely at the expense of projects located in electorates held by the Coalition. Specifically: 	 80  per cent of Ministerial decisions to not award funding to applications recommended by the advisory panel related to projects located in Coalition-held electorates. This was most notably the case in round three, where 93  per cent of those recommended applications that were rejected were located in Coalition-held electorates. For round four, 54  per cent of recommended applications that were rejected were located in Coalition‑held electorates; and 	 64  per cent of Ministerial decisions to fund applications that had been categorised by the panel as other than ‘Recommended for Funding’ related to ALP-held electorates compared with the 18  per cent relating to Coalition-held electorates. Having regard to the Minister’s advice to ANAO (see paragraph  13) that she viewed only those applications categorised as ‘Not Recommended for Funding’ as involving the approval of a not recommended application, 57  per cent of approved applications from this category related to ALP-held electorates compared with 17  per cent relating to Coalition-held electorates. Performance audits have been undertaken of each of the major regional grant funding programs introduced by successive governments over the last eleven years. Over this period, improvements have been observed in some important aspects of the design and implementation of regional grant programs. Nevertheless, in respect to each successive program there have been shortcomings in the design and administration of the assessment and decision‑making processes, and indicators of bias in the awarding of funding to government-held electorates. Such situations detract from the measures that have been implemented to date to make improvements to the grants administration framework, noting that it was experience with one of the earlier regional grant funding programs that was a catalyst for the introduction of the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. More importantly, these situations detract from the ability of grant funding programs to deliver on their policy objectives to the extent practicable, and are detrimental to those communities that would have benefited had funding been awarded to those projects that had been assessed, in a structured way, to be the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines. Against this background, a key message from ANAO audits of grant programs over the years, and highlighted in ANAO’s grants administration Better Practice Guides, is that selecting the best grant applications that demonstrably satisfy well-constructed selection criteria promotes optimal outcomes for least administrative effort and cost. Another recurring theme in the ANAO’s audits of grants administration has been the importance of grant programs being implemented in a manner that accords with published program guidelines so that applicants are treated equitably. Similarly, the grants administration framework was developed based, in part, on recognition that potential applicants and other stakeholders have a right to expect that program funding decisions will be made in a manner, and on a basis, consistent with the published program guidelines. There is also an important message here for agencies to underline this expectation in advice to Ministers so as to avoid any misunderstandings and promote informed decision-making. In this context, the most important message from this audit is that considerable work remains to be done to design and conduct regional grant programs in a way where funding is awarded, and can be seen to have been awarded, to those applications that demonstrate the greatest merit in terms of the published program guidelines. Ministers can show the way here by emphasising the importance of adhering to the published program guidelines, and discharging their responsibilities in accordance with wide considerations of public interest and without regard to considerations of a party political nature.

Methods: An evaluation checklist was developed, drawing on project management and health promotion literature, to Score 3 aspects of project quality: policy and contextual relevance (five criteria, scores 0 – 8), technical quality (five criteria, scored 0 – 6) and management quality (six criteria, scored 0 – 5). Teams of three people made consensus ratings with the checklist on each of 215 <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> submitted in response to Calls for Proposals in 2007 and 151 submitted in 2008.

40|$|Background: Evaluating {{applications}} for multi-national, multi-disciplinary, dual-purpose research consortia is highly complex. There {{has been little}} research on the peer review process for evaluating grant applications and almost none on how {{applications for}} multi-national consortia are reviewed. Overseas development investments are increasingly being channelled into international science consortia to generate high-quality research while simultaneously strengthening multi-disciplinary research capacity. We need {{a better understanding of}} how such decisions are made and their effectiveness. Methods: An award-making institution planned to fund 10 UK-Africa research consortia. Over two annual rounds, 34 out of 78 <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> were shortlisted and reviewed by at least five external reviewers before final selections were made by a face-to-face panel. We used an innovative approach involving structured, overt observations of award-making panel meetings and semi-structured interviews with panel members to explore how assessment criteria concerning research quality and capacity strengthening were applied during the peer review process. Data were coded and analysed using pre-designed matrices which incorporated categories relating to the assessment criteria. Results: In general the process was rigorous and well-managed. However, lack of clarity about differential weighting of criteria and variations in the panel’s understanding of research capacity strengthening resulted in some inconsistencies in use of the assessment criteria. Using the same panel for both rounds had advantages, in that during the second round consensus was achieved more quickly and the panel had increased focus on development aspects. Conclusion: Grant assessment panels for such complex research applications need to have topic- and context-specific expertise. They must also understand research capacity issues and have a flexible but equitable and transparent approach. This study has developed and tested an approach for evaluating the operation of such panels and has generated lessons that can promote coherence and transparency among grant-makers and ultimately make the award-making process more effective...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the design and implementation of the Liveable Cities Program, including the assessment and approval of applications. Overall conclusionThrough the LCP, a total of $ 20  million in grant funding was awarded to 26 projects located in 14 major cities across all states and territories. These included seven infrastructure projects, primarily directed at improving pedestrian and cycling access but which also included the supply of low carbon energy, two residential developments and a rapid bus transit system. The other 19 projects approved were for planning, feasibility assessment and/or design activities that will inform future investment in infrastructure. The distribution of funding in geographic terms {{and the nature of the}} demonstration projects provided the desired mix foreshadowed in the program guidelines so as to contribute to achieving the program objective of improving the planning and design of major cities. By the end of April 2013, funding agreements had been signed for the majority of the approved projects, with most of these projects contracted to be delivered by the program’s amended completion date of 30 June 2014. Infrastructure’s management of the design and implementation of LCP was effective in most respects. Of note was that improvements were evident in the merit-assessment approach adopted by the department compared with earlier grant programs audited by ANAO. In particular: all <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> were assessed against published assessment criteria; andthe scoring approach adopted enabled the comparison of the relative merits of applications against each criterion and in aggregate. Infrastructure also adopted an improved approach to briefing the Minister on the outcome of the assessment process. The LCP briefing included a clear funding recommendation to the Minister based on the scores awarded against the assessment criteria and in consideration of the program objectives. In addition, a record was kept of the eight instances where the Minister’s decision diverged from the recommendation of the department—three projects not recommended by Infrastructure were approved by the Minister, and five projects recommended by the department were not approved for funding. This approach provides transparency and accountability for the advice given by Infrastructure, and the funding decisions that were subsequently taken. However, there remain opportunities for further improvements to Infrastructure’s grants administration practices. Firstly, there were shortcomings with the assessment of applications in relation to the department’s eligibility checking and aspects of its conduct of the merit-assessment process. Secondly, it needs to be recognised that applications that are assessed as not satisfactorily meeting the published merit assessment criteria are most unlikely to represent value for money in the context of the program objectives. In addition, an evaluation strategy was not developed at the outset of the program and remained outstanding as at May 2013, notwithstanding that most funding agreements had been signed by then and the program was nearly two years into its three year duration. Such a situation will have an adverse effect on the quality of advice to Ministers on any proposal to provide further funding to the program or to a similar program, as well as in assessing the contribution the program has made to the objectives of the National Urban Policy. As indicated, this audit of the LCP has identified improvements in key aspects of Infrastructure’s grants administration practices, which should be embedded in all grant programs within the department. The ANAO has made three recommendations to address the further opportunities for improvement mentioned above relating to: enhancing the assessment of <b>eligible</b> <b>applications,</b> by clearly and consistently establishing benchmarks for scoring against assessment criteria and a minimum score an application is required to satisfy for each criterion in order for an application to be considered for possible recommendation;recording the value for money offered by each proposal under consideration, having regard to the published program objectives and assessment criteria; anddeveloping an evaluation strategy during the design of a program...|$|R
