40|$|Abstract]: This project investigates and {{evaluates the}} use of the conformal, affine and {{projective}} transformation methods to derive parameters to convert three existing <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>systems</b> found within the Australian Capital Territory into the Geodetic Datum of Australia 1994 map projection Map Grid Australia. These existing <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>systems</b> are known as City <b>Co-ordinates</b> (CC), Preliminary <b>Grid</b> <b>Co-ordinates</b> (PGC) and Adjusted <b>Grid</b> <b>Co-ordinates</b> (AGC) and are located in separated zones through the ACT. Three styles of transformation have been used {{in each of the three}} co-ordinate zones and analysis has been made into which method is most suited when a conversion from a 2 D orthogonal <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> into another is required. Comparisons have also been made when using GPS observations and territory published values to derive parameters in converting values within each test area. Effects of extrapolation have been investigated to determine the magnitude of error when parameters are used outside the region used to derive them. The error from the effects of extrapolation, have also been contrasted against acceptable limits defined from class and order of known published values. Spatial information is at the forefront of industry and government and with the ever increasing quantity of available data to the spatial user, quality data is desirable and co-ordinate transformation offers a method to data users for the merging of data and <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> conversion within data sets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{implementation}} {{and testing of}} a numerical model {{that is based on}} a Cartesian fixed grid in vertical direction is described. The model uses the shallow-water equations and accounts for effects of stratification. In stratified environments, the terrain-following 0 -transformation, which is often used in shallow-watermodels, is known to introduce numerical errors in computing the baroclinic pressure gradient, especially in regions with varying depth. Although quite some research was carried out in the past on the improvement of the implementation of the baroclinic pressure gradient, it still is not entirely clear to what extent the errors related to this problem harm computational results. In order to compare both approaches, i. e. the Cartesian fixed <b>grid</b> and the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> based on the o-transformation, in a consistent way, identical discretizations of time and space were employed in both models, This allows to draw conclusions about the errors that are related to the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> used, without interference of other uncertainties. It is shown that for relatively simple flow configurations, both models yield comparable results. In case of stratified flow over a rapidly varying bathymetry, significant differences between the models were observed. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Finally, a Bayesian framework with Metropolis algorithm is adopted and the posterior distribution over the network calibration parameters are estimated.

A hypersurface in R^{n+ 1 } is isothermic_k if it admits {{line of curvature}} co-ordinates {{such that}} its induced metric is Guichard_k.

Both isothermic_k hypersurfaces in R^{n+ 1 } and Guichard_k orthogonal <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>systems</b> on R^n are invariant under conformal transformations. A sequence of n isothermic_k hypersurfaces in R^{n+ 1 } (Guichard_k orthogonal <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>systems</b> on R^n resp.) is called a Combescure sequence if the consecutive hypersurfaces (orthogonal <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>systems</b> resp.) are related by Combescure transformations.

Unlike the conventional approximation using a rectangular or cylindrical <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system,</b> this analysis adopts a natural conical <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> so that any approximation in geometry is eliminated. The strain and curvature components formulated in this orthogonal conical <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>system</b> have been employed to derive the strain and kinetic energy integrals. The energy functional is minimized in accordance with the Ritz procedure to arrive at a governing eigenvalue equation. Admissible shape functions compromising sets of two-dimensional orthogonal polynomials and a basic function are employed to account for the boundary constraints and to approximate the three-dimensional displacements of the conical shell. Comparison of natural frequency shows excellent agreement with the solution of finite element, finite strip and integral equation methods. The effects of subtended and vertex angles and other geometric parameters on vibration are investigated in a comprehensive parametric study. Selected vibration mode shapes are illustrated to enhance the physical understanding of vibration of such open conical shell panels...|$|R
