50|$|At 1:30pm on 1 April 2011, a Zig Zag Railway {{maintenance}} vehicle (the <b>Hi-Rail),</b> {{collided with a}} two-car Rail Motor on the No 1 Viaduct, Top Road, between Clarence and Top Points stations. The <b>Hi-Rail,</b> with a Driver and Passenger on board, was freewheeling down the hill in reverse in the section from Clarence towards Top Points. The Rail Motor, operated by a Driver, was travelling empty {{in the opposite direction}} from Top Points. The Rail Motor Driver saw the approaching vehicle and applied the brakes. However, the two persons on board the <b>Hi-Rail,</b> facing the opposite direction, did not see the Rail Motor before the collision. The force of the collision compacted the body of the <b>Hi-Rail</b> such that neither cab door would open. The two occupants of the <b>Hi-Rail</b> were injured in the collision and were assisted out of the <b>Hi-Rail</b> and onto the Rail Motor by the Rail Motor Driver who was uninjured. The force of the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. The investigation established that the collision resulted from the Driver of the Rail Motor and the Driver of the <b>Hi-Rail</b> not being aware that they were travelling towards each other on the same track in the Top Points-Clarence section. This lack of situational awareness resulted from procedural errors. The Rail Motor Driver departed Top Points without communicating his intention to his Guard or the <b>Hi-Rail</b> crew, and the Rail Motor Guard exceeded his authority by authorising the <b>Hi-Rail</b> to leave a worksite and proceed to Top Points. A number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications and operational safeworking errors. Other safety issues identified during the investigation included delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of Train Register Books; passengers travelling in the Rail Motor driver's cab; Rail Motor Driver's fatigue; and excess speed of the <b>Hi-Rail.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, many speeders were {{replaced}} with trucks (usually pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles) using flanged wheels {{that could be}} lowered for on-rail (called road-rail vehicles or <b>hi-rails</b> for highway-railroad). Speeders are collected by hobbyists, who refurbish them for excursions organized by the North American Railcar Operators Association in the U.S. and Canada and the Australian Society of Section Car Operators, Inc. in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A road-rail {{vehicle is}} a vehicle which can operate both on rail tracks and a {{conventional}} road. They are also called <b>hi-rail,</b> from highway and rail, or variations such as high-rail, HiRail, Hy-rail, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} 18 mi of {{line from}} Connersville through Metamora were formally {{purchased by the}} Whitewater Valley in 1983, followed later by an additional 1 mi of track in Connersville that was no longer wanted by the Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|The Wabash Central Railroad [...] is a short-line {{railroad}} {{that operates}} between Van Buren and Craigville, United States, crossing a Norfolk Southern Railway line in Bluffton. It began operations in 1997, replacing the Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation on an ex-Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad line.|$|E
5000|$|Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation [...] was a {{railroad}} which operated {{lines in the}} U.S. states of Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. It ceased operations after it was declared bankrupt in 1997. [...] The railroad was known for its extensive use of locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{was originally}} a main {{line on the}} Wabash Railroad 5th District from New Haven, Indiana, to Toledo, Ohio, and was latterly part of the bankrupt Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation. The line between Defiance, Ohio, and Woodburn, was acquired with funding from the Ohio Rail Development Commission (ORDC).|$|E

50|$|The {{line between}} Metamora and Connersville {{was sold to}} the {{non-profit}} Whitewater Valley Railroad in 1984, although freight operation from Brookville to Valley Junction was taken over in 1979 by the Indiana and Ohio Railway. Freight service was abandoned on the Whitewater line between Brookville and Connersville in 1974. The portion of the remaining NYC branch between Connersville and Beeson's Station was sold to Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|The {{report also}} points out that Metro-North's {{inspection}} procedures were somewhat insufficient, in that inspections were performed from a <b>hi-rail</b> vehicle traveling on a center track, while the inspectors had to examine four tracks at once. From the inspector's point of view, they would be unable to see all parts of the track due to distance issues. There were also issues with inspections being rushed to prevent delaying trains and deferred maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} operated {{as part of}} an Illinois Central Railroad line that ran all the way to Newton, Illinois. Illinois Central sold off the line south of Browns, Illinois, to Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation; the line went through a succession of operators, all of which had to contend with the line's ancient bridge over the Wabash River near Grayville, Illinois. The bridge suffered damage from floods on more than one occasion, and one span finally collapsed completely around 1999.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2013 PIR {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with J.L. Patterson & Associates, Inc. to commence inspections of the bridges, tunnels, track, and rail. A [...] "summary level" [...] report of the general condition of the bridges was completed in October 2013. [...] So far, J.L. Patterson has completed initial repairs by clearing sand from the line that blew into the line's right-of-way with a ballast regulator and ran a high-tech Holland Track Geometry <b>Hi-Rail</b> truck on the Desert Line to identify defects on the entire Desert line.|$|E
50|$|Scenes of Midwestern US landscapes appear behind train layouts {{and many}} action shots (as the protagonist and allies battle the villains {{on and off}} the train, and get thrown off or jump {{on and off the}} moving trains) to add {{narrative}} integrity to the fictional location. Most of the interior station scenes set both in Kansas City and Chicago actually show different parts of Toronto's Union Station, except for a brief sequence immediately prior to the crash, where the train is rapidly approaching a bumper {{at the end of the}} line. That sequence was filmed from a <b>Hi-Rail</b> truck entering the Chicago and North Western Railway's downtown Chicago terminal.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{completed}} in about 1880 by the Delphos, Bluffton and Frankfort Railroad and Frankfort, St. Louis and Toledo Railroad, predecessors of the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad (Clover Leaf). In about 1990, the Indiana <b>Hi-Rail</b> Corporation leased from the Norfolk Southern Railway {{the portion of the}} old Clover Leaf between Douglas, Ohio and Van Buren, Indiana. After that company went bankrupt, the new Wabash Central Railroad acquired the portion west of Craigville, beginning operations in December 1997. (Another portion, in Ohio, went to the Delphos Terminal Company, and the rest was abandoned.) The Big 4 Terminal Company bought about 1.5 mi at the Craigville end in 2003 to conduct switching services.|$|E
50|$|Several days later, Macrie and two Seashore Lines {{employees}} {{conducted a}} detailed, thorough track {{inspection of the}} entire area of the theft, which consisted primarily of the removal of tie plates and spikes, referred to as OTM (Other Track Material) in the rail industry. The inspection was performed via track car and <b>hi-rail</b> truck, and by walking the track. Their inspection concluded that {{the area of the}} theft encompassed approximately 6,800 linear feet of their main line. The actual theft of the OTM represented 75 percent of the total amount of tie plates and spikes in that particular section of track. In their actions to remove the tie plates and spikes, the perpetrators also damaged and destroyed numerous cross ties.|$|E
5000|$|Adapting {{automobiles}} as gasoline railcars {{is recorded}} {{as early as}} 1912 and early publicity on Jeeps mentioned their potential use as an inspection car. The USAAF in Australia used flanged-wheel jeeps as switchers in 1943, which led to testing as road-switchers for future operations in New Guinea. Perhaps the first large-scale use of jeep as locomotive was in the CBI theatre. [...] Eleven days after the Normandy landing, jeep speeders were in use on the continent, surveying lines for use or repair.Postwar, jeep speeders were used as inspection cars, and jeep trains used for light service, including recreation. The Jeep train at Lewis and Clark Cavernsclaimed to be the shortest jeep railway. Over time, <b>hi-rail</b> vehicles pushed dedicated speeders out of railroads; civilian jeeps were often used.|$|E
50|$|The Valley Railroad Company leases, {{from the}} Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the track running from Old Saybrook up through Essex, Deep River, Chester, Haddam, and Middletown, totaling 22.67 mi. The {{trackbed}} is gravel ballast, with track made of conventional wood crossties, with steel rails {{fastened to the}} ties. A major project funded by the Company in 2015 put all mainline track from Essex (MP 4) to North Chester (MP 9.80) in stone ballast. The track connects with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor track near the Old Saybrook Station to the south. Presently, 13.25 miles of the line are restored for train service, with the remaining last seeing service in 1968. The rail corridor between Haddam and Middletown, which has been cleared of brush and receives property maintenance and surveillance from <b>hi-rail</b> vehicles, and is undergoing full restoration as time and funding permit.|$|E
50|$|Track {{inspection}} {{was originally}} done by track inspectors walking the railroad and visually inspecting every section of track. This was hazardous {{as it had}} to be done while trains were running. It was also manpower intensive, and inspectors were limited in the amount of track they could inspect on a given day. Manual instruments had to be used to measure various parameters of the track.The primary benefits of track geometry cars are the time and labor saved when compared to doing manual inspections of track. Track geometry cars may travel up to 217 miles per hour (335 kilometers per hour), inspecting track the whole time. More commonly, on freight railroads, geometry cars travel at track speed (up to seventy miles per hour) in order to minimize service disruptions. Current track geometry cars may cover large portions of the system in a single day. Many times, maintenance gangs will follow the geometry car and fix defects as the geometry car moves along the track.Because track geometry cars are full-sized rail cars (with the exception of some lighter <b>hi-rail</b> geometry cars), track geometry cars also provide a better picture of the geometry of the track under loading (when compared to the manual methods which did not take this into account). Finally, track geometry data is generally stored and can be used to track trends in the degradation of track. This data can be used to pinpoint and predict trouble spots in the track and plan maintenance programs accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|Keene's {{manufacturing}} {{success was}} brought on {{in part by}} its importance as a railroad city, being the meeting place of the Cheshire Railroad, the Manchester & Keene Railroad, and the Ashuelot Railroad. By the early 1900s all had been absorbed by the Boston & Maine Railroad. Keene was home to a railroad shop complex and two railroad yards. The Manchester & Keene Branch was abandoned following the floods of 1936. Beginning in 1945, Keene was a stopping point for the Boston & Maine's streamlined trainset known at that time as the Cheshire. Keene became noteworthy again in 1962 when F. Nelson Blount chose {{the city for the}} site of his Steamtown, U.S.A. attraction. Unfortunately, the plan fell through, and after one operating season in Keene the museum was relocated to nearby Bellows Falls, Vermont. The Boston & Maine abandoned the Cheshire Branch in 1972, leaving the Ashuelot Branch as Keene's only rail connection to the outside world. In 1978 the B&M leased switching operations in Keene to the Green Mountain Railroad, which took over the entire Ashuelot Branch in 1982. Customer decline and track conditions forced the Green Mountain to end service on the Ashuelot Branch in 1983 and return operating rights to the B&M. However, there were no longer enough customers to warrant service on the line. In 1984 the last train arrived in and departed Keene, consisting of Boston & Maine EMD GP9 1714 with flat cars for rail removed from the railyard. Track conditions on the Ashuelot Branch were so poor {{at the time that the}} engine returned light to Brattleboro, and a <b>hi-rail</b> truck was used to remove the flatcars instead. In 1995 the freight house, one of the last remaining railroad buildings in town, burned due to arson. Today the railroad beds through town exist as the Cheshire Rail Trail and the Ashuelot Rail Trail.|$|E

40|$|Friction {{management}} using wayside gauge {{face and}} {{top of rail}} systems is widely used in heavy haul railway industry. Gauge face lubrication practice in the rail/wheel contact area on <b>hi-rail</b> gauge corner is not effective when {{there is little to}} no grease in the gauge corner area. Lubrication is effective when the grease is able to withstand the pressure and temperature and carried properly on the gauge corner contact area. There is myth that long bars are not suitable for effective wayside lubrication. Field trial conducted in this research has demonstrated that long bars are effective compared to short bars. This paper presents outcome of extensive field testing of lubrication equipments and lubricants and the implementation of friction management on the Central Queensland coal lines with an aim to develop best practices for Rail Curve Lubrication for Heavy Haul Lines in Australia...|$|E
40|$|North American railroads {{have for}} many years applied {{lubrication}} to the wheel/rail interface to control wheel and rail wear, reduce lateral forces in curves and produce substantial savings in train energy (fuel) consumption. The traditional method of applying lubricant to the rail is through wayside lubricators. In recent years substantial improvements in wayside equipment technology has improved equipment reliability, reduced maintenance requirements, increased the track miles treated by each lubricator and minimised lubricant waste. While wayside systems can provide excellent gauge face protection to the high rail of curves, results on Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) demonstrate that current wayside systems are unable to reliably provide the recommended fiction levels for {{the top of the}} rail. Wayside systems must be supported by other technologies, such as on-board systems, <b>hi-rail</b> applicators or innovative wayside systems to provide effective top of rail friction management.

40|$|In July and August, 2007, a {{configuration}} of {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) antennas mounted on a <b>hi-rail</b> vehicle {{was used to assess}} the ballast condition and characterize the subballast and subgrade along over 250 miles of track in Wyoming and Alaska. The GPR setup utilized 2 GHz horn antennas mounted over the shoulders and a 500 MHz horn antenna mounted between the rails. The 2 GHz data were processed to assess the ballast fouling condition on the shoulders. The 500 MHz data were obtained with the intent of mapping the subballast/subgrade interface and anomalous features typically associated with perched water or the water table. Twenty ground truth holes were dug at each location and samples were extracted typically at 6 -in. depth increments through the ballast layer and in most instances into the subballast and subgrade. The maintenance concerns associated with the Alaska Railroad track were focused on frost susceptible sections. Whereas ballast fouling associated with coal dust was the major maintenance priority of the track in Wyoming. These two structurally different railroads, exhibiting different substructure maintenance requirements, were effectively characterized using one GPR setup. Good correlation was also observed between the processed GPR data and available ground truth...|$|E
40|$|The Aurizon (formerly QR National) Workshops in Rockhampton {{is a large}} rail heavy {{maintenance}} facility where the primary function is to repair and modify rollingstock. As the workshops are {{in close proximity to}} the Central Queensland coal fields most of the rollingstock presented are coal wagons and locomotives. Due to {{the fact that most of}} the rollingstock in the workshop yard is unpowered an external power source in the form of a rail mounted shunt vehicle is used to place the rollingstock in the desired location. The site has two shunt vehicles, a DN 300 and a DN 100. Both vehicles are designed for on road and on track operation. The on track operation is facilitated by the rubber road tyres contacting the track to provide traction with the on track guidance provided by <b>hi-rail</b> wheels front and rear. Both machines have derailed during normal operations heightening the risk of possible injury as well as causing major disruptions to production as the machine is quarantined for investigation following a derailment. Management are therefore very keen to try and establish a root cause of these derailments. The focus of this preliminary report is to provide an update on the investigations into the root causes of these derailments. ...|$|E
