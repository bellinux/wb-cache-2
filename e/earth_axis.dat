In Mobile Suit Gundam (1979), Several asteroids have been moved from the asteroid belt to positions in Earth's Lagrange points.

Juno, formerly a mining asteroid, is renamed Luna II and moved to the L3 Lagrangian point opposite to the Moon.

50|$|In 1686, Edmond Halley had {{proposed}} a theory {{in an attempt}} to explain the Trade Winds, a theory which remained the most widely known internationally almost {{to the beginning of the}} 19th century. George Hadley's version recognised that the Earth's rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass moving relative to the Earth, an element that had been missing in Halley's proposal. Later, in the second half of the 19th century, Hadley's theory was itself shown to be deficient in that it was based on an assumption that when air mass travels from one latitude to another its linear momentum is conserved. However, since the air mass is at all times in a state of circumnavigating the <b>Earth</b> <b>axis,</b> it is in fact the angular momentum that is conserved, causing an effect known as the Coriolis effect. When using the correct angular momentum conservation in calculations the predicted effect is twice as large as when the erroneous conservation of linear momentum is used. The fact that Hadley's principle is deficient in this respect is not known to everyone who should know; it can still be found in popular books and popular websites.|$|E

For typical stellar masses, the flux magnification can be significant only if the lens passes very close to the pulsar [...] <b>Earth</b> <b>axis.</b> We show {{that in the case of}} a pulsar the time varying travel-time delay, which is observable because of the pulsating nature of pulsar radiation, is a much more powerful tool to investigate mass distributions in the GC. We find that a travel-time delay is measurable even for rather large distances between the lens and the pulsar [...] <b>Earth</b> <b>axis.</b> The time varying travel-time delay can be used to determine the mass of the lens and the ratio of the transverse velocity to the minimum impact parameter. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic data sets we give the expected accuracies in the parameter determination for various masses. We argue that pulsars found behind the very center of our Galaxy would provide an excellent opportunity to test the mass distribution in the Galactic nucleus, and therefore to distinguish between a super massive black hole (SMBH) and a super-dense star cluster (SDSC) within the central 0. 1 pc.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{important}} {{features of a}} proxy time series recorded during the Late Pleistocene. They are: 1) 100 000 -year cycle as a dominant control of global glacial-interglacials through the late Quaternary, 2) fluctuations with periods of about 40 and 20 thousand years (their contribution to dispersion {{is no more than}} 20 %), 3) ''Red-noise'' behavior of the time series. Direct influence of the insolation change created by fluctuations of the eccentricity is too weak to cause the observed 100 000 -year climate fluctuations. Therefore, other mechanisms of such a rhythm are proposed. On the basis of the equation of the heat budget, the equation describing dynamics of zonally averaged temperature is developed. Various combinations of terms of this equation are discussed. They present a linear response to the Milankovitch periodicity, the Langeven stochastic equation, the equation of delay oscillator, the stochastic equation of spontaneous transitions, and the equation of stochastic resonance. Orbitally-induced changes in the solar energy flux received by the Earth play an important role as a mechanism starting process of climate changes which is supported and intensified by different feedbacks within the climate system. Positive anomalies of solar radiation serve as a mechanism causing reorganization of the climate only in rare cases when inclination of <b>Earth</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation increases and, simultaneously, perihelion takes place during the summer time (for the Northern Hemisphere) ...|$|E

The accuracy of such clocks was better than 1 s per day, and the observations of stellar transits allowed their synchronization with sidereal time. This "hybrid feature" of the Clementine Gnomon to measure solar and stellar transits allowed Bianchini to accomplish in 1703 the whole measurement of the duration of the tropical year, which was usually made by comparing observations very widely spread in time. The small deviation of the Line from true North of ~ 4 ' 30 " Eastwards has been measured comparing the delays of transits at both solstices with respect to the ephemerides.

40|$|Heliodons {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate sunlight direction in relation to a building model. In the pursuit of a heliodon capable of producing quasi-parallel light impinging on physical building models for simulating sunlight impingement for various hours of the day and various days of the year, and for varying latitudes, yet occupying a space generally affordable in an architect’s design studio, a new table top heliodon has been developed. This paper reports on this heliodon which simulates the directional and parallelity aspects of sunlight. It employs a movable artificial directional light source assembly giving light onto a building model which is placed on a horizontal model stand. The light source assembly is adjustable for giving simulated sunlight (only simulating for the directional and parallelity aspects of sunlight) onto the building model, for the desirable day, time, and latitude of the location of the modelled building. This directional adjustment of light is effected by moving the simulated light generator about the simulated <b>earth</b> <b>axis,</b> thus also allowing strong demonstration of physical solar movement around the building model. In order to receive the simulated sunlight which comes out in a limited face area of the lens, the building model and/or its stand have to be moved to ensure that the simulated quasi-parallel light will fall onto the desirable parts of the building model. This model movement is a simple movement just for keeping the correct north-south orientation of the building model, and for catching the simulated sunlight, without tilting the building model. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{properties}} of rootzone media {{are very important}} physical factors that affect the energy balance and temperature distribution in the rootzone.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of peat, calcined clay (Profile), calcined diatomaceous <b>earth</b> (<b>Axis),</b> zeolite clinoptilolite, and polymer coated clay (Bio-flex-a-clay) on the thermal characteristics of a sand-based medium. The thermal properties of these amendments alone and mixed with sand were measured using a thermal-time domain reflectromery (TDR) method at various water contents. The temperature effects of these amendments were evaluated in a field study where sand/inorganic amendment mixtures were used as rootzone media of a golf green. Volumetric heat capacities of the pure amendments were significantly different at oven-dried,- 400 mm tension, and saturated conditions. When mixed at 85 % sand and 15 % amendments (v/v), the peat mixture had the highest heat capacity of 2. 05 × 106 MJM- 3 C- 1, all other inorganic soil amendments/sand mixtures had higher heat capacity values than that of sand, which was 1. 59 × 106 MJM- 3 C- 1 at - 400 mm tension.
