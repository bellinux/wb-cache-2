2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a financial <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would have to allow all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage interest deduction so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to discuss {{intermediation}} on-line from the perspective of two-sided markets. It builds a simple model of the intermediation activity when trading partners are involved into a commercial relationship and uses it to illustrate some of the results that emerge in the two-sided market literature, as well as to discuss some new aspects. The first part concentrates on a monopoly <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> and discusses both efficient pricing and monopoly pricing.

The product quality hypothesis states that independent agents provide both insurers and customers with higher service quality and therefore, remain on the market. On the contrary, according to the market imperfections hypothesis both intermediary types offer the same quality, and only coexist due to information asymmetries. Having conducted a written survey, we measure service quality differences by multivariate regression analysis. Our analysis shows that the higher level of service quality of independent agents supports the product quality hypothesis. The result is a separating equilibrium on the market.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which market structure is determined endogenously by the choice of intermediation mode. We consider two representative business modes of intermediation that are widely used in real-life markets: one is a middleman mode by which an intermediary holds inventories which he stocks from sellers {{for the purpose of}} reselling to buyers; the other is a market-making mode by which an intermediary offers a platform for buyers and sellers to trade with each other. In our model, buyers and sellers can simultaneously search in an outside market and use the <b>intermediation</b> <b>service.</b> We show that a marketmaking middleman, who adopts the mixture of these two intermediation modes, can emerge in a directed search equilibrium...|$|E

Besides, the market is fully covered only if the population of agents who pay for <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> is not too heterogeneous. Under competition, matched agents are matched efficiently, but some of them remain unmatched. The quality provision and market coverage objec-tives cannot be reached simultaneously.

Internet and intranets communication facilities are making the amount of available information quite large and it keeps on increasing progressively (at the same time, information requested by users, is gradually rising too). It is imperative to find some mechanism that allows clients and servers to interchange information in a fluent and precise manner, minimizing the time normally spent in finding really useful information, that tends to be quite high. This article describes a case of study of a multi-agent system (MAS) based <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> for e-commerce, implemented with Java and CORBA.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{research}} in service-oriented computing (SoC) is mainly about technology standards for SoC {{and the design}} of software components that implement these standards. In this paper we investigate the problem of requirements engineering (RE) for SoC. We propose a framework for goaloriented RE for e-services that identifies patterns in service provisioning and shows how to compose business models from them. Based on an analysis of 19 business models for e-intermediaries we identified 10 <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> patterns and their goals, and show how we can compose new business models from those patterns in a goal-oriented way. We represent the service patterns using value models, which are models that show which value exchanges business patterns engage in. We conclude the paper {{with a discussion of}} how this approach can be extended to include business process patterns to perform the services, and software components that support these processes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{distributive}} trades sector, which is primarily {{accounted for by}} wholesale and retail trade, is not only economically important in its own right, but also relevant to monetary policy. Ultimately, it is retailers who set the actual prices of most consumer goods. They are the main interface between producers of consumer goods and consumers, with around half of private consumption accounted for by retail trade. The “value added” of this <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> can be substantial, as this accounts for, on average, about 25 % of consumer prices. The purpose of this report is to analyse the structural features of the {{distributive trades}} sector and the developments within it, {{as well as how}} these may influence prices and price dynamics. This report contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the impact of the structural features of the distributive trades sector on prices and price-setting behaviour, thereby improving on previous research in this area. From a policy perspective, it highlights the importance of structural reforms that help enhance competition in this sector. This report uses a wide range of data sources – some of which are unique – to study an area that has been under-investigated, especially at the European level. There is, however, ample room for further research in this direction. JEL Classification: E 58, F 41 competition, distributive trades, monetary policy, prices, retail trades...|$|E
40|$|Labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> {{are used}} to improve the {{connection}} between job seeker and job. They aim not only to get job seekers more quickly into new jobs but also {{to make a better}} quality match, getting the more appropriate worker into the right job. Done well, labor intermediation helps reduce short-term unemployment, reduce job rotation, reduce the cost of new hires, improve productivity and firm growth, and importantly, reduce job discrimination. For many years, labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> were embodied in a single national public employment service that varied in quality and investment. Today, we find a range of public and private <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> and a wider range of products and services, including those to link workers to training, self-employment, and social services. This policy brief first examines the characteristics of labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services,</b> then reviews key reform efforts in developed and Latin America and Caribbean economies, and lays out the principal institutional models or public/private configurations that can be found in these countries. It concludes by providing a series of recommendations and considerations for Latin American and Caribbean countries seeking to reinvigorate or reform labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services.</b> In particular, the policy brief offers some key considerations for adapting labor <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> to the realities of Latin American and Caribbean economies. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{liberalization of}} trade in both inter-temporal intermediation services and goods {{in a joint}} spatial-inter-temporal trade model. Joint multi-commodity spatial intertemporal models are not (to our knowledge) used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable and (in the presence of incomplete markets) existence can also be an issue. Here we use numerical simulation methods. We first consider world with service trade autarky {{in which there is}} no domestic <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> provision, and service trade liberalization involves costless inter-temporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. This simple treatment allows us to model service trade liberalization as removing period by period budget constraints for domestic consumers. In such a world, if nonzero tariffs apply to spatial trade we present an example showing how service trade liberalization can be welfare worsening. One implication is that negotiations on services in the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) need not be welfare improving if there are also ongoing tariff negotiations. We then expand the model to capture a more complex world where costly intermediation services can be provided by both within-country and foreign providers. We again illustrate how services liberalization can be welfare worsening. We finally discuss whether welfare worsening service trade liberalization is likely in a real-world situation of highly restricted services trade and considerably more open goods trade, and when services trade are around 1 / 3 of total goods and services trade as is often claimed from available global service trade data. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the interest rate, market entry and credit decisions which banks {{are expected to}} make following financial liberalization. It uses analytic tools from information economics and industrial organization theory to consider the policy implications of behaviour which responds to the constraints of imperfect information. The financial markets of the Caribbean Commonwealth supply the stylized facts which inform the analysis. Chapter 1 introduces the topics treated. The financial liberalization hypothesis {{is based on the}} 1973 works of McKinnon and Shaw. Chapter 2 describes their characterization of market fundamentals and behaviour in LDCs. It discusses the descriptions of equilibrium, and the welfare implications of these equilibria, in models which analyze economies with similar fundamentals. Chapter 3 derives stylized facts from the descriptions of the economic institutions and financial systems of the four Caribbean countries whose banking behaviour we model. Chapter 4 analyzes deposit rate determination by banks in the long-run equilibrium of a search market. It posits that in long-run equilibrium depositors find it costly to switch banks because doing so requires that they forego improved service at their current banks. The inelastic deposit supply which results from these switching costs implies that monopsonistic deposit rates are a noncooperative equilibrium. It is argued that this facilitates tacit collusion among banks and that a deposit rate floor is the appropriate policy corrective. Chapter 5 argues that the enhancement of <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> responsible for depositor switching costs reflects the information banks acquire about customers and their ability to offer suitably tailored service. Chapter 6 considers bank entry into a market where established customers of certain value have switching costs. Entering banks attract new customers of lower expected value. If new banks are therefore unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover their fixed costs, they exit. This chapter argues that liberal entry policy is not sufficient to ensure competition. Chapter 7 develops a simple model of bank screening by loan size in one sector of an economy. It finds a sequential equilibrium in which low-risk borrowers, self-select by the choice of contracts with a loan size below that they demand at the interest rate for their risk class. In Chapter 8 the partial equilibrium model of Chapter 7 is embedded in a general equilibrium framework to demonstrate that the market equilibrium is not constrained Pareto efficient. It argues that subsidizing the highest interest rates will improve loan allocation while maintaining the separation induced by private contracts. Chapter 9 summarizes the main results and conclusions of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Banking {{has always}} been an {{extremely}} competitive industry and competition has become tougher over the last years. Every bank has two sides to consider, customers and investors. Customers, however, are clearly {{the most important part of}} a bank as they provide the basic raw materials of deposits and the demand for loans, which are the revenue streams of net interest income but also provide the fee income. The bank offers an <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> between customers with excess funds and those with a funds deficit. It borrows and lends wholesale funds to keep the two piles in some kind of balance. The drivers of customer behaviour are complex. Understanding the needs of their customers and reacting to the changes of their behaviour, aid banks and financial institutions to face the hard competition. Clearly then, the success of a bank is subject to its ability to attract and retain its customers, and a large part of their business. This ability depends on what is called the image of a bank. In highly competitive sectors, like the banking sector, the image represents an asset which allows firms to differentiate and increase their success chances. However, although its impact on consumer behavior is of primary importance, a bank's image is a difficult asset to value and quantify. The concept of image has been given considerable attention in the literature over the past years. Image has been defined as the total impression that an entity makes on the minds of people and as the net result of the interaction of beliefs, ideas, feelings and previous experiences with an institution, which are stored in memory and transformed in concepts. Especially a bank's image can be seen as the perception that customers or potential customers have for a specific bank, based on the messages they received by the examined financial institution. Image is a strategic tool since it helps banks to achieve long-term objectives and it can be shown as a source of competitive advantage. The present paper builds on the previous work on the subject and focuses on the definition and measurement of a bank's image. It introduces image as a variable which expresses a bank's current state of development and future prospects. It identifies the factors affecting this variable, suggests ways of measuring them and uses image as the basis for the building of a non-linear model expressing a bank's development. The image of a bank, as defined in this paper, may prove a very useful tool for planning purposes, since it doesn’t only give an early diagnosis of possible changes, sometimes discontinuous, in the bank's pattern of progress, but also indicates the reasons for them. Hence, it may be used as the basis for designing appropriate measures to assist a bank's evolution. The theoretical findings are applied to a group of banks operating in Greece and the results are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Whether {{and how to}} tax {{financial}} <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> {{is unclear}} because individual preferences are not defined directly over financial services, but only over the goods that are consumed. <b>Intermediation</b> <b>services</b> facilitate consumption but do not directly provide utility.

This is consistent with Foley's (1970) and Hahn's (1971) well-known treatments of general equilibrium with transactions costs which suggest that the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics may not hold in such circumstances.
