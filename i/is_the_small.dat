5|$|To {{the left}} of the open space north of the medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city. Missing in the painting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> island of Strömsborg, which was little more than an insignificant cliff at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Highway61 in the south, {{the route}} {{proceeds}} straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road {{to the west}} and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north of that. At the latter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection.|$|E

5|$|In the grounds, {{the only}} certain {{survivor}} from the medieval period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> crenellated drum tower. Its original purpose is unknown. It adjoins a substantial wall that {{may also have}} origins in the 13th century. The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre-date around 1730, when the stables were built. All of the other buildings, including the lodge at the South entrance (1851) are Georgian or Victorian. The medieval appearance of the eastern barn resulting from incorporation of stone from the former medieval barn that {{stood in front of}} the house.|$|E
5|$|Past Lone Pine, {{the highway}} passes by Manzanar National Historic Site, a {{concentration}} camp where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. The next community is Independence, the county seat of Inyo County and the home to the Eastern California Museum. Just north <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Fort Independence Indian Reservation and the Tinemaha Reservoir. Nearby is where the Los Angeles Aqueduct is tapped from the Owens River; with more vegetation visible north of this point. In {{this portion of the}} valley is Big Pine and the Big Pine Indian Reservation. From here to Bishop the highway is overlapped with SR 168.|$|E
5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} throne hall <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> porch, {{projecting}} out {{at the front of}} the building. Under this porch stands the Busabok Mala Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the larger building itself. The high base of the throne is surrounded by praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, the throne was used when the king appeared before his vassal states; later it was used for certain ceremonies. The two doors to the hall is situated at the sides of the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{name came}} from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All {{that can be seen}} of the Burne, or Bourne, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.|$|E

5|$|This {{was added}} to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small {{intimate}} room where the family could eat in private away from the servants. Above it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Oriel Bedroom, probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room. At {{the same time that the}} oriel room and bedroom were added, rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall: the Great Parlour with Great Chamber above, and the Little Parlour with Little Parlour above. John Lyte, the builder, placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but {{paid for by the}} Conduit Lands Trust. The Museum Gardens were opened in 1859 to complement the new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> area between the Museum Gardens and the wider Beacon Park. The central fountain was unveiled as the central focus of the Museum Gardens in 1871. A bandstand was also installed close to the junction of the Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds, and was positioned to provide a focus for the avenue through the Museum Gardens.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Whitegate was {{restored}} in 1874–75 for the 2nd Baron Delamere, retaining {{much of the}} medieval interior but rebuilding the exterior, adding a short chancel, and incorporating half-timbering. StPaul's Church, Boughton in Chester was Douglas's own parish church which he rebuilt in 1876 incorporating parts of the pre-existing building. Douglas's only church built entirely in half-timbering <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> church of St Michael and All Angels at Great Altcar in Lancashire. A church built in brick with half-timbering is St Chad's (1881) at Hopwas in Staffordshire. During this period Douglas built or restored a series of churches entirely in stone, incorporating mainly Gothic features together with vernacular elements. These include St John the Baptist's Church, Hartford (1873–75), St Paul's, Marston (1874, now demolished), the Presbyterian Chapel (1875) at Rossett, Denbighshire, St Stephen's, Moulton (1876), the rebuilding of Christ Church, Chester (also in 1876), the Church of St Mary the Virgin (1877–78) at Halkyn, Flintshire, and the Welsh Church of St John the Evangelist (1878) in Mold, also in Flintshire. Later in this period he built StMary's Church, at Pulford in 1881–84 for the Duke of Westminster and in 1882–85 St Werburgh's New Church at Warburton for Rowland Egerton-Warburton.|$|E

5000|$|Now r/2 is a {{rational}} number greater than 0 and <b>smaller</b> than r.(In <b>the</b> above symbolic argument, [...] "r/2 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> rational number" [...] would be Q and [...] "r (which {{is different from}} r/2) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> rational number" [...] would be ¬Q.)But that contradicts our initial assumption, ¬P, that r <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> rational number. So we can conclude that the original proposition, P, must be true — [...] "there is no smallest rational number greater than 0".|$|R
50|$|The Petersen graph has a Hamiltonian path but no Hamiltonian cycle. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> bridgeless cubic graph with no Hamiltonian cycle.
