5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also {{eager for a}} match between one of her two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ships}} had separated, as Stockholm crew members were {{beginning}} to survey the damage, a miraculous discovery was made. On the top deck of Stockholm, one of the crew came across Linda Morgan, who had been thrown <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> on the Andrea Doria as the two ships collided and landed on the Stockholms deck, suffering moderate but not life-threatening injuries. Others, unfortunately, were not as lucky, as five of the Stockholms crew perished in the collision.|$|E

50|$|Henry Kyemba, then Uganda's Minister of Health, {{said that}} he had allowed Bloch to stay in {{hospital}} for an extra night before being returned to the other hostages. However, she disappeared <b>from</b> <b>her</b> hospital <b>bed,</b> and on 13 July, MP Ted Rowlands said that she was presumed dead. Kyemba later said that Bloch had been dragged <b>from</b> <b>her</b> hospital <b>bed</b> and murdered by members of the Ugandan Army loyal to Idi Amin. The policeman guarding Bloch was also killed. A suggested motive for her killing was as retaliation for the deaths of 50 Ugandan soldiers during Operation Entebbe.|$|R
25|$|Upon Jutta's {{death in}} 1136, Hildegard was {{unanimously}} elected as magistra {{of the community}} by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence {{for herself and her}} nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.|$|E

She has spoken of the combined effects that news corporations and search engine Google have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that she felt her son's generation would need in order to ascertain truth. She told Nylon magazine that social networking site Facebook and Google's development [...] "by the CIA" [...] was harmful to internet freedom. Some criticised the claim as lacking detail.|$|E
500|$|The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and {{the parish}} had some {{difficulty}} {{in finding a}} replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter {{in a room with}} no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed.</b> On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by [...] "something horrible". Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; {{in the middle of the}} first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the Daily Mirror, these incidents attracted the attention of several psychic researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted that she was having a sexual relationship with the lodger, Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons. The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.|$|E
500|$|Elspeth learns {{from her}} premonitions, and her cat Maruman's prophecies, that a keeper from Obernewtyn, a feared {{institution}} where Misfits {{are sent to}} work, will come to take her there. Soon, when delivering tea to visiting Head Keeper of Obernewtyn, Madam Vega, Elspeth accidentally reveals she is a Misfit, though not to what extent, and is soon dispatched to Obernewtyn. Her first few weeks at Obernewtyn are spent in the kitchen, where she is worked to the bone. The cook’s daughter delights in tormenting her. The favoured Misfit, Ariel, and farm overseer, Rushton, immediately dislike her. Later reassigned to the farm, an encounter {{with a pair of}} Misfits named Matthew and Dameon reveals she is not alone in her particular abilities. She also befriends Cameo, a delicate, pretty Misfit of whom Matthew is very fond. Elspeth, plagued by nightmares, begins to feel there is a dark secret underneath their everyday tasks. While working, Elspeth decides to test the range of her telepathic ability, [...] "farseeking", but beyond the boundaries of Obernewtyn, a strange machine, the Zebkrahn, traps her mind. She is only freed by combining her mental strength with another anonymous mind who offers assistance. Asked by Vega to look out for [...] "special" [...] Misfits, her interview reveals the Doctor is a defective simpleton; his [...] "assistant", Alexi, has no interest in Elspeth in his quest to find the [...] "right one" [...] who will lead him to what he desires. Elspeth and Matthew later deduce that tortuous experiments on their kind are occurring, and they resolve to escape. Cameo begins disappearing <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> at nighttime, and Elspeth fearfully suspects that Cameo is the subject of some of these experiments.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 1995, Selena {{contacted}} Leonard Wong {{about the}} perfume samples {{he had made}} for her. According to Wong, Selena told him she would be meeting Saldívar {{the next morning to}} pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. The same day, she told another employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. At 7:30a.m. (CST) Friday, March 31, Selena rose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed,</b> donned green workout sweats, and left for Saldívar's motel room. At the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico. Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital, where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed [...] "clear symptoms of depression." [...] Saldívar told medical staff she had bled [...] "a little". The staff noticed Selena angrily respond that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because Saldívar [...] "was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country." [...] While driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Quintanilla, Jr. According to Dr. Martinez, Selena had tried to contact him that morning but he could not speak on the telephone because he was performing surgery. At 10:00a.m. (CST), Quintanilla, Jr. contacted Pérez to determine the whereabouts of Selena; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. Pérez called Selena on her cellular telephone and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was [...] "taking care of one last [...] business" [...] and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and was the last time Pérez heard her voice.|$|E
2500|$|Two anachronisms are {{presented}} by Cunningham in his book. [...] The first is on page 30 (1998 edition) where he writes of Virginia Woolf, [...] "She rises <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>bed</b> {{and goes into}} the bathroom." [...] Hogarth House was built in 1720 and in 1923, {{it did not have}} a bathroom, only an outhouse. The second is on p.43 where Mrs. Brown in 1949 sees [...] "beside the roses stand cereal box and milk carton..." [...] Although Lucerne Dairy did have milk cartons in 1938, they did not come into common use until the 1960s. These are both corrected in the film; Woolf is depicted using a ewer and basin to wash in the morning, and the Browns have milk in a bottle.|$|E
