5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans. Cunard Line officials, who {{were responsible for the}} security at the dock, said they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest. The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this and that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E
500|$|Zito's fastball has hovered between [...] and [...] He augments it with {{a circle}} changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch. His curveball was voted {{the best in the}} Major Leagues in a player poll {{conducted}} by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> Zito's curveball, commenting: [...] "It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you're not going to hit it." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{the ladies}} {{all looked at}} him, and thought they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so terrible as that squint.|$|R
500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing my legs ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Eggleston's friend William Christenberry {{introduced}} him to Walter Hopps, director of Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery. Hopps later reported being [...] "stunned" [...] by Eggleston's work: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|White people [...] {{standing}} in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were listening. Openness and nothing on guard—I {{saw that in}} everybody. I {{was so happy to}} see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe {{in the words of a}} black person. I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that.|$|E

5000|$|... 2000 - {{international}} concert {{debut in}} London, England. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> that compares to Apollyon Sun's show" [...] (Valerie Potter, Metal Hammer UK, 2000).|$|R
60|$|I took Van Sweller {{to my own}} rooms--to my room. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it before.|$|E
60|$|Drexley looked up. There was {{the dull}} {{hopelessness}} of despair in his bloodshot eyes. Douglas, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it before, felt an unaccountable sense of depression sweep in upon him.|$|E
60|$|They {{were not}} always bashful, it must be said. Sometimes they were distressingly bold, and {{they came to the}} point of {{offensive}} warfare with a readiness and assurance which scared Josie. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like this," [...] Isobel said softly. I {{looked up}} from the {{writing-pad}} on my knee, and she met my glance with a smile of contrition.|$|R
6000|$|Toby {{followed}} {{without a}} question, {{though he was}} wholly {{at a loss to}} understand what the [...] "women's wagon" [...] was, for he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> which looked like one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare for't, I b'lieve he's bewitched her," [...] she said, stupefied, <b>having</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> {{like the}} martial {{expression}} which now gleamed from those soft brown eyes. [...] "Why, Mara dear,--putty little Mara." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{thanked him}} very warmly, for she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> such an {{instrument}} before, and it interested her. 'It was very thoughtful {{of you to}} make it,' she added. 'How came you to think of such a thing?' ...|$|E
60|$|Trevor {{caught it}} neatly in one hand, and stood {{staring at it}} as if he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it before. And yet he had--often. For what he had caught was a little golden bat, about an inch long by an eighth of an inch wide.|$|E
60|$|So, with a {{gulf between}} him and the good company of about a foot in width, {{standard}} measure, Mrs Plornish's father was handsomely regaled. Clennam <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> his magnanimous protection by that other Father, he of the Marshalsea; and was lost in the contemplation of its many wonders.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Edmonstone {{might well}} retain her opinion when, after the quadrille, Guy came {{to tell her}} that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so delightful; and he entertained Mary Ross with his fresh, joyous pleasure, through the next dance.|$|R
6000|$|Unquestionably, {{the popular}} {{thing in this}} world is novelty. These people <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> of that cowboy {{business}} before, and it carried them clear off their feet with delight. From all around and everywhere, the shout went up: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I believe you?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Remember that I saw you {{strike that}} man! It was horrible! I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it! You {{were like a}} wild animal! They {{tell me that he}} was very badly hurt. Is it true?" ...|$|R
60|$|And so it continued, only {{growing more}} intense in blue and sunlight, all day. After breakfast, I {{came in from}} the well under {{strawberry}} bed, to say I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, so pure or intense, in Italy; and so it went glowing on, cloudless, with soft north wind, all day.|$|E
60|$|Only Jill {{returned}} the manager's gaze. She was {{seated on the}} outer rim of the semi-circle, and she stared frankly at Mr. Goble. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> him before, and he fascinated her. This behaviour on her part singled her out from the throng, and Mr. Goble concentrated his attention on her.|$|E
60|$|The {{contrast}} of Heyst's quiet, polished manner gave her special delight and {{filled her with}} admiration. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that before. If she had, perhaps, known kindness in her life, she had never met the forms of simple courtesy. She was interested by it as a very novel experience, not very intelligible, but distinctly pleasurable.|$|E
60|$|We <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> {{like the}} stage child outside a theater {{excepting}} one--that {{was on the}} pavement {{in front of a}} tailor's shop in Tottenham Court Road. He stood on a bit of round wood, and it was fifteen and nine, his style.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{the wrong}} side of the continent! I should say not!" [...] Laura exclaimed, {{pointing}} to where in the distance the buildings of the Exposition gleamed almost snow-white in the dazzling sunshine. [...] "Why, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful in my life." ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly two pretty lads sprang {{out of the}} sack. They {{brought in}} oak tables, which they spread with silken covers, and placed all sorts of delicious dishes and {{refreshing}} drinks on them. The man <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful in his life, and he was delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "True enough," [...] said Billy. [...] "Stop shaking, youngster. The {{first time}} they put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs and kicked {{every bit of it}} off. I hadn't learned the real science of kicking then, but the battery said they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{king and}} his {{minister}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> what they then saw. They could hardly believe it was not all magic and enchantment. At {{the end of the}} feast each of the guests was given a present of great value, and was sent away rejoicing. The king received a pearl as big as a marble; the minister a cup of wrought gold.|$|E
6000|$|In Devonshire Place, Lisson Grove, a {{short while}} back died an old woman of seventy-five years of age. At the inquest the coroner's officer stated that [...] "all he found {{in the room was}} a lot of old rags covered with vermin. He had got himself smothered with the vermin. The room was in a {{shocking}} condition, and he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. Everything was absolutely covered with vermin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not {{strange that}} they should rise like this--like a wall from the water?" [...] Wulf said. [...] "Had they been built up by human hands they could {{scarcely}} have been more erect and regular. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> at all like it on land." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here {{again we}} were at fault. In all our lives we <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> in the air. We <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even looked there. [...] "Now," [...] {{continued}} the Stranger, [...] "I want your paper to help. I want you to join in. I {{want you to give}} publicity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not really}} tired at all," [...] she assured him, [...] "only you <b>see</b> I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{been in a}} big city, {{and it is very}} noisy here, isn't it? Besides, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so {{beautiful}} as this house. I think it frightened me a little." ...|$|R
