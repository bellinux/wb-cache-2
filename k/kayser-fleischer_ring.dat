40|$|A 65 -year-old {{man with}} Fanconi’s {{syndrome}} was investigated {{for the cause}} of chronic liver disease. Wilson’s disease was diagnosed based on the detection of bilateral <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>rings,</b> a low serum ceruloplasmin level, increased urine copper excretion and positive histochemical stains of his liver for copper. This case is unusual because of the patient’s elderly age at the time of diagnosis and the absence of neurological changes due to Wilson’s disease in spite of advanced hepatic disease and the presence of <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>rings.</b> Even in the elderly patient, Wilson’s disease should be considered a possible cause of chronic liver disease...|$|R

40|$|Wilson's disease (WD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by copper overload. In this disease, inadequate hepatic excretion leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Severe neurological symptoms can develop {{in patients with}} WD, often {{in the absence of}} relevant liver damage: it is unclear whether liver transplantation (LT) could reverse neurological symptoms, and at present LT is not recommended in this setting. We report a case of regression of neurological symptoms in a patient affected by WD with prevalent neurological involvement. A 19 -year-old man with disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms from WD that included frontal ataxia, akinesia, dystonia, tremors, and behavioral disorders in the presence of preserved liver function (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score= 7; Child-Turcotte-Pugh score=A 5) underwent LT in November 2009. At the time of LT, encephalic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated diffuse neurodegenerative alterations involving subtentorial and supratentorial structures; bilateral <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>ring</b> was present. Four years after LT, laboratory tests show normalized copper metabolism and excellent liver function test results. Encephalic MRI shows a substantial improvement of already-known signal alterations at nuclei thalamus and putamen, mesencephalon, and pons. <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>ring</b> disappeared from the right eye, but a little remnant is still visible in the left eye. At neurological examination, all of the previous symptoms and signs are no longer present and behavioral disorders are no longer present; psychosocial functions are completely restored. The present case provides some evidence that LT may be a valid therapeutic option for WD patients with marked neurological impairment, particularly in those no longer responsive to chelation therapy...|$|E

50|$|Wilson's disease {{involves}} a mutation {{of the gene}} coding for the enzyme ATPase7B, which prevents copper within the liver from entering the Golgi apparatus in cells.

Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by hepatic impairment and movement disorders. Typical facial manifestations, although not pathognomonic, include excessive grinning, in which the patient grins to trivial stimuli, 1 as demonstrated in this report; sustained open-mouth smile, when a par-kinsonian face is associated with a dystonic dropped jaw (sometimes referred to as “vacuous smile”) 2; and fixed forced smile, when facial dystonia produces a sustained spasm of risorius and zygomaticus muscles (also referred to as “risus sardonicus”) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 17 -year-old girl with haemolytic anaemia as presentation of Wilson disease. The diagnosis {{was based on}} the findings of < 20 mg/dl ceruloplasmin serum level, <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>ring</b> and Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia. Genetic testing revealed the presence of the H 1069 Q heterozygous mutation. The patient was treated with Zinc acetate monotherapy, with good response, maintened after 22 months. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentation of Wilson disease, which must always be considered in patients with Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia. The good clinical response to treatment with zinc acetate monotherapy in our case might lend to consider the use of zinc monotherapy as initial therapy also in symptomatic patients with Wilson disease under close clinical observation. Clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for use of zinc monotherapy as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with Wilson disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} patient with chronic {{postmenopausal}} estrogen intake with presence of <b>Kayser-Fleischer</b> <b>ring</b> in the cornea and Alzheimer's disease and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of estrogen intake and copper accumulation in various tissues, including the central nervous system. Sonography was compatible with copper accumulation in the basal ganglia, but the patient showed no clinical signs of Wilson's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography revealed a typical pattern for Alzheimer's disease. We propose increased copper levels as a direct effect of estrogen intake due to an augmented ATP 7 A-mRNA in the intestine. Moreover, we discuss the impact of elevated free serum copper on accompanying Alzheimer's disease, knowing that copper {{plays a crucial role}} in the formation of amyloid plaques and tau aggregation. This might offer a partial explanation for the observation that postmenopausal estrogen therapy is associated with a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease...|$|E

Cardiac autonomic function tests including blood pressure response to standing and heart rate response to standing were observed to be normal.
