25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means of a}} bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> is highly non-linear. That means that the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E

25|$|In a {{specialized}} circuit called inverted triode, {{the roles of}} anode and grid are reversed. This places the control electrode at a maximum distance from the space-charge region surrounding the filament, minimizing the amount of electrons collected by the control electrode, and thus minimizing the <b>input</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E
25|$|These {{electric}} circuits {{can also}} easily perform {{a wide variety}} of simulations. For example, voltage can simulate water pressure and electric current can simulate rate of flow in terms of cubic metres per second. An integrator can provide the total accumulated volume of liquid, using an <b>input</b> <b>current</b> proportional to the (possibly varying) flow rate.|$|E
25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The <b>input</b> <b>current</b> is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E
50|$|The {{largest of}} the <b>input</b> <b>currents</b> sets the common {{potential}} VC. As a result, the corresponding output carries almost all the bias current, while the other outputs have currents that are close to zero. Thus, the circuit selects {{the larger of the}} two <b>input</b> <b>currents,</b> i.e., if IIN,1 > IIN,2, we get IOUT,1 = IBIAS and IOUT,2 = 0. Similarly, if IIN,2 > IIN,1, we get IOUT,1 = 0 and IOUT,2 = IBIAS.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Input</b> bias <b>current</b> — a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nA for bipolar FDAs, or picoamperes for CMOS designs) flows into the <b>inputs.</b> This <b>current</b> is {{mismatched}} slightly between the inverting and non-inverting inputs (there is an <b>input</b> offset <b>current).</b> This effect is usually important only for very low power circuits.|$|R
25|$|Note: Tabulated {{formulas}} in Table 3 {{make the}} g-equivalent circuit of the transistor from Figure8 agree with its small-signal low-frequency hybrid-pi model in Figure9. Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = output resistance, and gm = transconductance. The negative sign for g12 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for g12 means the output current affects the <b>input</b> <b>current,</b> that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If g12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E
25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the <b>input</b> <b>current</b> of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E
25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} <b>input</b> <b>current</b> drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Matrix {{rectifier}} (AC-DC MC) is a four-quadrant AC-DC {{power converter}} device with compact topology. This paper concerns {{the influence of}} abnormal power supply conditions to the matrix rectifier. The input and output performances of matrix rectifier with pure sinusoidal supply voltages are discussed. The <b>input</b> <b>currents</b> are symmetrical sinusoidal without any low-order components. But due {{to the absence of}} DC capacitors, the abnormal conditions at input side affect the input and output performances directly, which introduce ripples into the DC output and cause the distortion of <b>input</b> <b>currents.</b> In this paper, the low-order harmonic components in <b>input</b> <b>currents,</b> and ripples at output side are theoretically analyzed under conditions that the input voltages are unbalanced and non-sinusoidal respectively.

40|$|The {{proposed}} unity {{power factor}} converter system which {{is able to}} operate from a 150 V three-phase supply whilst delivering the required 200 V DC voltage has been built and tested. This circuit functions as a high power factor low harmonic rectifier based on the concept that the peak capacitor voltages are proportional to the line <b>input</b> <b>currents.</b> Hence the low frequency components of the capacitor voltages are also approximately proportional to the line <b>input</b> <b>currents.</b> The system can be designed to achieve nearly sinusoidal supply <b>input</b> <b>currents,</b> when operated with discontinuous resonant capacitor voltages Output power control is achieved by variations of the IGBTs switching frequency.

25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the <b>input</b> <b>current.</b> As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased <b>input</b> <b>current,</b> and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E
