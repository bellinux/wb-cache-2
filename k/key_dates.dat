5|$|By mintages, the <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> in {{this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, although more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of Maya kingship {{from the very beginning}} of the Classic Period through to the very end of the Terminal Classic (800–900). The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E

25|$|As {{elections}} have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known {{well ahead of}} time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run {{for a minimum of}} 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at the latest. On 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council – close of rolls on 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the return of writs on or before 28 April 2006.|$|E
25|$|The 1995–96 season saw {{significant}} {{change to the}} entire Rockets organization: not only the loss of defenceman Aleksandr Alekseyev and captain Dallas Thompson due to age, but the decision to relocate the Rockets to Kelowna, British Columbia. After long deliberation and consideration for the City of Tacoma and the many dedicated fans who supported the Rockets, the 22,000-seat Tacoma Dome {{was no longer a}} long-term viable home for the Rockets. <b>Key</b> <b>dates</b> became more difficult to secure, leaving the Rockets in search of home ice for playoffs {{at the end of each}} regular season. No future of change for the poor sightlines in the arena brought the Rockets organization to the conclusion the team needed to be moved. There were several viable choices prospected; however, Kelowna's rich history in hockey and the prospect of a new arena made Kelowna the natural choice. With the Rockets' relocation came the acquisition of talent in the form of future first-round NHL draft pick Kyle McLaren and fifth-round pick Dale Purinton, as well as the hometown players Jason Deleurme, Ronny Grimmard and Trevor Lornson.|$|E

500|$|Except for the 1894-S dime, {{there are}} no great rarities in the series, as mintages were {{generally}} high. <b>Key</b> <b>dates</b> for the dime include the 1895-O, 1896-S, 1897-O, 1901-S and 1903-S. For the quarter, <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> are the 1896-S, 1901-S, and 1913-S. The rarest half dollar is the 1892-O [...] "Micro O", in which the mint mark [...] "O" [...] for New Orleans was impressed on the half dollar die with a puncheon intended for the quarter; other <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> are the regular 1892-O, 1892-S, 1893-S, 1897-O, 1897-S, 1914, and 1915. As half dollars were heavily circulated, prices tend to steeply rise for all coins in higher grades. [...] "Condition rarities", relatively inexpensive in circulated condition but costly in high grades, include the 1901-S, 1904-S, and 1907-S half dollars. Thus, although most dates are obtainable, many are scarce in uncirculated grades. Note too that in 1909 a new half dollar hub was introduced. [...] This made the headband word [...] "Liberty" [...] stronger, thus changing a grading diagnostic. [...] Finally, large quantities of Barber coins were melted for bullion when silver prices rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E

50|$|In coin collecting, a <b>key</b> <b>date</b> {{refers to}} a date (or date and mint mark combination) of a given coin series or set that is harder to obtain than other dates in the series.

500|$|The <b>key</b> <b>dates</b> of {{the series}} include the 1866 variety which lacks the motto [...] "In God We Trust", of which only two are known; one sold at auction in 2005 for $1,207,500. [...] Another rarity is the 1870 struck at San Francisco (1870-S), of which the mintage is not known as their {{striking}} was not recorded in that mint's records. [...] Those records indicate that in May 1870, the San Francisco Mint returned two dollar reverse dies to Philadelphia as mistakenly sent without mint mark, and received two proper replacements. [...] There is no record of any 1870-dated obverse dies for the dollar being sent to San Francisco; nevertheless, the coins exist. [...] Breen, writing in 1988, lists twelve examples known, which he speculates may have been presentation pieces, meant to be inserted in a cornerstone. [...] One sold at auction for $1,092,500 in 2003. [...] A similar mystery attends the 1873-S, which despite the stated mintage of 700, is not known to exist. [...] Two of the pieces were routinely sent to Philadelphia for examination at the 1874 meeting of the United States Assay Commission, but apparently were not preserved. [...] Breen suggests that the remaining mintage may have been melted along with obsolete silver coins.|$|E
