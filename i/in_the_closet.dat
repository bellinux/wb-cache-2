5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> and died of fright and starvation. Due to a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> {{she could not have}} suffocated.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that his refusal to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must have lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
50|$|Cherishing spiritually {{integrated}} {{communities is}} something that does not change through the ages. Now, possibly more than ever, we are challenged to build authentic relationships with other believers, teaching and equipping them to take <b>the</b> next step <b>in</b> their faith. This faith of course does not leave us <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> where we learned it, but emboldens us to walk out onto the streets, being the same powerfully Christian presence that we see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sons and Daughters of the Covenant and Liber Graduum communities so many years before us.|$|R

She stands down and asks Niki to join her; they split up when she doesn't join her. Shane later sleeps with Niki, leaving Jenny heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E

Parker (Julie Gonzalo) calls attention to Mercer. In addition to a bomb threat against Hearst, Dean O’Dell notices his window being egged before a mysterious man enters and the Dean asks “What are you doing here?” Keith arrests Mercer and Moe. Logan intentionally gets himself arrested so he can go into the cell with Mercer and Moe.|$|E

Sedgwick argues that limiting sexuality to homosexuality or heterosexuality, in a structured binary opposition, is just too simplistic.|$|R

5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E

The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E

25|$|Other plot changes, such {{as making}} Läerte less cynical and more {{positive}} towards Hamlet early on, not only simplified the story but heightened {{the tragedy of}} their duel in the Gravediggers Scene. Making Gertrude a co-conspirator alongside Claudius, enhanced the dramatic conflict between Hamlet and Gertrude when Hamlet attempts to coerce a confession from her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Closet</b> Scene. Making Polonius a co-conspirator, as revealed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Closet</b> Scene, strengthened Hamlet's motivation in rejecting his marriage to Ophélie. This crucial change facilitated the transformation of Shakespeare's Ophelia into the opera's Ophélie, a creature who dramatically is almost entirely drawn from the 19th-century, whose madness stems not from {{the actions of a}} man who creates an intolerable situation, but rather from a man whose withdrawal leaves an emptiness she is unable to fill. Musically, of course, the Mad Scene was one of those audience-pleasing creations which drew upon well-established operatic tradition.|$|E
