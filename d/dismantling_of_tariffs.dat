The real gross domestic product per capita would increase in the US and in all 27 EU member countries. Also when one looks at labor markets, the positive effects on employment predominate: Two million additional jobs could be created in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) zone over the long run. The public welfare gains of these economies admittedly do stand in contrast with real losses in income and employment {{in the rest of}} the world.

40|$|During {{the last}} half of the twentieth century, the {{development}} of information and communication technologies (ICTs) proceeded at an amazing rate. Now, the data production in the world makes it such that our knowledge doubles every three to five years. With new policies associated with free market economies, minimal governmental regulations regarding production, and the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> and related international trade controls, neoliberalism has become the driving force in the development of Latin America. Building on these ideals, and stressing the priority of the individual, new trends in sustainable human development have married the goals of sustainable and equitable development, long the goal for many Latin American countries, with new ICTs. In past years, the use of new ICTs has enabled many Latin American countries to leapfrog stages of development. Skipping older, outdated and often costly technologies, some countries have afforded their people opportunities never imagined. The ability to leapfrog older and less useful modes of technology has long been acknowledged. Where those in rural areas of Latin America did not even have electricity twenty to thirty years ago, they now have cellular telephones and access to the Internet. The newfound right t...|$|E
40|$|Bilateralism is {{mushrooming}} in the Asia - Pacific, yet {{the motives}} for it remain puzzling. Why do countries devote substantial effort to bilateral free trade agreements that are providing limited additional benefits when compared both with unilateral liberalisation {{and with the}} multilateral regime? Furthermore, some of the deals recently implemented are less trade liberalising than the powerful rhetoric would suggest. For example, {{the free trade agreement}} between Australia and the United States is not including “substantially all the trade” and, on top of that, is asymmetric – Australia’s access to the American market is more restricted than vice versa. The paper first addresses some conceptual issues and analyses the disadvantages of bilateral free trade agreements. Here, the need for rules of origin is of particular concern. These have two effects. First, they result in additional costs to producers. Whilst the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> reduces the cost of trade, the need to administer rules of origin increases them. Second, transnational production is made more complicated. In order to qualify for duty free trade, the region for the sourcing of inputs shrinks, with negative consequences for competitiveness. Subsequently, the bilateral agreements of Australia, Singapore and Thailand will be examined. At closer inspection, these preferential deals are not convincing. All of them require complex rules of origin and do not make a significant contribution to the liberalisation of trade...|$|E

40|$|After the Second World War, {{and until}} the mid- 1960 s, France and Italy adopted two {{different}} monetary and exchange rate policies {{as a consequence of}} the relative degree of commitment to the opening of their respective domestic economies. While the Italian economy was oriented to a gradual opening of the domestic market, which indeed implied a substantial strengthening of the national manufacturers and producers, the French economy was less clearly committed to open her domestic market, with some consequences on the exchange rate policy. After the World War both Italy and France stabilised rather shortly, even though at slightly different times, in 1947 and 1948. Notwithstanding, in 1949, in the wake of the Marshall Plan aids and US confronting a recession phase, all the European countries devalued against the US dollar to a very different extent. If Great Britain and the sterling area devalued strongly, by 30 per cent, Italy was less prone to adjust her currency to such a hard measure, whilst France opted for a rather robust rate in between: thus, Italy devalued by a modest 8 per cent and France by 22 per cent (Milward, 1984; Eichengreen 2007). In the ensuing decade the Italian central authorities, especially the Bank of Italy, engaged themselves in stabilising prices and gradually pegging the currency to the dollar on a stable basis. A relatively low exchange rate was adopted and Italy successfully pegged her currency to the dollar in 1950 at nominal 624, 8 liras against the US dollar. Such an exchange rate and the parallel trade liberalisation policy favoured a subsequent export-led growth period with positive effects on the output and industrial dynamics. Instead, until the late 1950 s France adopted a strong currency policy in order to preserve the national grandeur, even if this had some relevant effects on the price stability and the macroeconomic performance. In 1957, finally, France devalued and shifted towards the dismantling of domestic barriers to foreign manufacturers. According to the existing literature this difference in the exchange rate policy had an important impact on investments and on the related productivity growth rate in these countries. The deferred exchange rate adjustment in France entailed a parallel deferred increase in investments and technological updating of the industrial sector in the country (Boltho, 1996 a). As observed, indeed, the French economic growth gained momentum after the 1958 substantial change in economic policies, with the significant currency depreciation of 1957 - 58 and the upsurge in competition stemming out from the gradual opening of the domestic market and from the rise of the infra-European trade (Sicsic and Wyplosz, 1996). Even at a first sight the increase in per capita growth rates both in France and Italy is related at the exchange rate policy, even if the role jointly played by the other relevant policy of economic opening is not always assessed as a part of the same bundle of coherent economic policies. Thus, it may be useful to compare exchange rate policies and trade policies in these couple of countries which experienced a similar economic ‘miracle’ in the 1950 s- 1960 s, although they started to grow at a significant pace at different times as a consequence of a lag in the change of economic policies. In a way, the French choices of the late 1950 s seem to follow and replicate what the Italian central authorities decided to reach almost a decade earlier: the integration in a regional European market through the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> and restriction to imports, the price stabilisation and convertibility of the currency after having reached a low depreciation in real terms. Such a policy produced a long term effect on the productivity growth rate as a result of conspicuous investments and technological transfers, on one side, and a reallocation of factors, both by sectors and regions, on the other one. The Italian economy started growing at a high rate from the mid- 1950 s, after a prompt stabilisation and a robust anchorage of the lira to the dollar at a favourable real exchange rate. Such a choice was arguably responsible for an upsurge in exports and investments with relevant gains in productivity. A similar scheme was adopted by French authorities only in the late 1950 s, after a period of price instability and rationing...|$|E

40|$|On 01 July 2011, a {{free trade}} {{agreement}} was provisionally implemented between the EU and South Korea. At the time, there were clear expectations within the EU business community in Seoul about the likely impact of the deal, including an increase in EU exports, the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> and existing non-tariff barriers (NTBs), the possible emergence of new NTBs, the further development of mechanisms for discussion and problem-solving mechanisms, and a shift in Koreans’ perceptions of all imported EU goods as luxury items.

In addition to contributing to the general academic debate on the impact of FTAs and adding specific colour to the case of the EU-Korea FTA, this research will play an important role in shaping responses to the shifting economic, social and cultural trends that will impact the future outcomes of this key trade deal between the EU and Korea.
