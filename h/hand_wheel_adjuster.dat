5000|$|The {{operator}} {{would first}} select a single CH station by changing a timer so it picked up only the signals from that station. CH stations broadcast in time slots, {{one after the}} other, so {{it was easy to}} select a single station using a simple timer. Once the station was selected, the signal was examined on the left of the two displays, which showed the entire [...] of a second that was allocated to that CH station. Using a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel,</b> the operator <b>adjusted</b> the timing until the main blip of the directly received signal was at the 12 o'clock position. Once this was done, the right-hand CRT, showing only the first [...] of the time slot, was used to make finer measurements. This scope's maximum time corresponded to a range of 300 km, but by delaying its sweep the operator could continue tracking as the aircraft flew over Germany.|$|R

50|$|The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three {{modes of}} drive {{operation}} were automatic, local, and manual. In automatic, the drives {{would follow the}} bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system. In local, the drives would follow {{the motion of the}} trainer's and pointer's <b>hand</b> <b>wheels.</b> (This is similar to power steering on a car.) Manual was direct gear linkage from the <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to move the mount with no power assist.|$|R

Current double sided wheels typically have a fixed sprocket {{on one side}} and a freewheel sprocket on the other.|$|R
5000|$|Trainer : Controls the mount's train angle (bearing). He sits in {{the right}} front corner of the mount. (See the far right man in the Mk21 open mount picture.) In front of him, are his optical sight, <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and train drive {{controls}}. Between his knees is a large box called the Train Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the train power drive. On top of the box, is a window {{with a set of}} dials that indicate the train angle of the gun, and the automatic train orders electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials also tell him the difference between the gun's present train angle and the ordered train angle. He changes the bearing of the gun, by moving his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the train drive into Auto. This disengages his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and gives train angle control to the Fire Control System. Then, he reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Train in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the train drive to local. In local control, he controls the gun's train angle with his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to keep his sight's vertical cross hair on the target.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} came in {{a number}} of variants with sliding, <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> or keyboard selected letters. The keyboard models and some rotary select units were motorised to allow faster operation. Modern units are usually electronically controlled with computer interfaces.|$|R

5000|$|Pointer : [...] Controls the mount's {{elevation}} and firing. He sits in {{the left}} front corner of the mount. In front of him, are his optical sight, <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and elevation drive controls. To his right, about elbow high, is a large box called the Elevation Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the elevation power drive. Through a window {{on top of the}} box, he sees a set of dials that indicate the elevation of the gun, and the automatic elevation orders coming from the Fire Control System. Above the Indicator Regulator is the Electrical Fire Select Switch. It is a rotary switch with three positions: Off, Local, and Auto. Off disables the electrical firing system on the mount. Local enables the electric firing key on his right <b>hand</b> <b>wheel.</b> Auto enables the off mount electrical firing circuit from the Fire Control System. Just outside his right knee, is the Percussion Select Lever. This mechanical lever has two positions: Safe, and Armed. When it is in the armed position, the mechanical linkage for percussion firing is enabled. His right footrest is at one end of this linkage, and the firing pin sear in the breech block is at the other. By rocking his right foot forward, he fires the gun. Electrical firing is the primary firing method. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials tell him the difference between the gun's present elevation and the ordered elevation electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. He changes the elevation of the gun, by moving his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the elevation drive into Auto. This disengages his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and gives elevation control to the Fire Control System. Then, he moves the Electrical Fire Select Switch to [...] "AUTO", and reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Elevation in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the elevation drive and the Electrical Fire Select Switch to local. In local control, he controls the gun's elevation with his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to keep his sight's horizontal cross hair on the target. At the command of the Mount Captain, he fires the gun by squeezing the firing key on his right <b>hand</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Computer {{numerical}} control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools {{by means of}} computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands.

50|$|Since a torque is {{produced}} by {{the interaction of the}} magnetic fields, the movable element is held by a mechanism such as a worm gear.

2500|$|Ashby's Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill with a boat shaped cap. It had two Patent sails and two Common sails. The cap was winded by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel,</b> no fantail being fitted.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how height of a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> affects maximum torque production and risk of injury to the shoulders and back of workers. Background: Workers in the processing, refinery, and energy generation industries manually open and close valves with <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> that require high torque. This task is physically strenuous and can lead to shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Method: Maximum torque exertions in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions at three heights (knee, chest, and overhead) were tested. Results: The torque production in the counterclockwise (left) direction was greater than that of the clockwise (right) direction (150. 5 N·m vs. 141 N·m). This main effect was independent of valve height, as there was no interaction between direction and valve height (p =. 686). Participants exerted at least 10 % greater torque at the overhead level than at the chest level (means of 153. 2 N·m vs. 138. 3 N·m). There was no difference in maximum torque between knee and overhead levels and between knee and chest levels. Conclusion: According to ergonomics principles, the risk of MSDs affecting the shoulder and trunk from turning valves should be lowest at chest height because the postures of the shoulder and trunk are at or near neutral. However, workers exerted greatest torque when the valve was located overhead. Whether valves located at overhead height, compared with chest height, present greater risk of MSDs to workers is not known. Application: Design engineers should avoid placing <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> valves at knee height or lower...|$|R

50|$|Central {{focusing}} is {{an arrangement}} which involves rotation {{of a central}} focusing <b>wheel</b> to <b>adjust</b> both tubes together. In addition, {{one of the two}} eyepieces can be further adjusted to compensate for differences between the viewer's eyes (usually by rotating the eyepiece in its mount). Because the focal change effected by the adjustable eyepiece can be measured in the customary unit of refractive power, the diopter, the adjustable eyepiece itself is often called a diopter. Once this adjustment has been made for a given viewer, the binoculars can be refocused on an object at a different distance by using the focusing <b>wheel</b> to <b>adjust</b> both tubes together without eyepiece readjustment.|$|R
