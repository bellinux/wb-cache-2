5|$|The six {{warehouse}} workers win $950,000in {{a lottery}} pool, and quit in a celebratory fashion of {{running through the}} office, making a mess and mooning the staff. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) was originally part of the pool but stopped when he was promoted, and falls into a depression, unable to find any motivation to work and further dismayed when his ex-wife's response to him not winning is to ask <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number of his pool-winner friend Glenn. Everyone else speculates how they would spend a hypothetical lottery score, with Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) ultimately deciding to fuse their two main ideas into one for a lovely brownstone located in the great outdoors.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo {{reported}} that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype is reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California. Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Eala {{also made}} noise during the well-publicized Fil-sham (foreigners posing as Filipinos; only Filipinos can play as locals in the PBA, foreigners play as imports) {{controversy}} that has hounded the league for years. In 2004, Eala suspended six foreign cagers {{because of lack}} of documents to prove their Filipino blood. This also led to a controversial decision by Talk N' Text to suit up Asi Taulava during Game One of the Philippine Cup championship series against Ginebra. Taulava played <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Phone</b> Pals, that resulted in a win. Two days later, however, the commissioner reversed the decision and awarded Ginebra the win.|$|E
25|$|Jim Sorrels and Rosalie Stringfellow {{met while}} {{performing}} in theater in Boise, Idaho. Jim worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> {{company as a}} lineman and was seven years older than Rosalie. The two married in 1952 and his job took them to Salt Lake City where they opened their home to actors, musicians, and poets living or visiting in the area. During the marriage, they had five children {{and the house was}} filled with love, laughter, music, books and words. Both loved jazz music and Rosalie joked that Jim married her to get access to her collection of jazz recordings. Over time, her interest in the folk music of her childhood was piqued and she began to study at the University of Utah with noted folklorist, Wayland Hand. She learned to accompany herself on guitar during this period and attended folklore society meetings and seminars.|$|E
25|$|They {{continued}} to fight {{even as the}} American press trumpeted the rapid crumbling of German resistance. The regiment helped to capture the Ruhr Pocket, where thousands of German troops and hundreds of German vehicles were captured. The unit crossed the Altmuhl River on 25 April, the Danube River on 27 April, and the Isar River on 30 April. There Major Butler collapsed due to exhaustion on 30 April, and Lt. Col. J. A. Gallagher assumed command {{for the last few}} days of the war. When hostilities ceased on 7 May 1945, the regiment had during six months of fighting experienced 300 percent turnover due to casualties. The regiment assumed occupation duties in Hammelburg and Bad Bruckenau until it was shipped home in the summer of 1945. Lt. Col. Butler retired from the Army on 14 January 1946 and worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> company {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

500|$|... "Get Your Number" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin and Bryan-Michael Cox, and produced by the former two and LRoc. It was released as the third international single from Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The song is built around a sample of [...] "Just an Illusion" [...] (1982) by British band Imagination. Due to {{the inclusion of the}} sample, several other writers are credited as songwriters. Lyrically, the song features the protagonist persistently asking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number of an individual at a club.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{featured}} the computerised {{head of a}} cat named [...] "Ratz" [...] who provided links, but this was dropped after one series. It was replaced by commentator Mitch Johnson, who, {{as well as providing}} commentary and links for each item, would interact with both audience and presenters too. From the second series, two puppet leprachauns, later named as Sage and Onion became regulars. They were played by Don Austen and John Eccleston, and were designed and built by Darryl Worbey Studios. They performed comedy sketches throughout the morning, and often interacted with the people in the studio. Another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was Mr Blobby, who had previously appeared in Noel's House Party. Most regular features were dropped for the final series, when the show was revamped. A feature that stuck throughout was the jingle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number, first 081 811 8181, then 0181 811 8181, then 0845 610 1515.|$|E
500|$|Bret buys a new cup for $2.79 {{so that he}} and Jemaine {{no longer}} have to share one cup. A month later, they find out that their check <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> bill bounced because their account was short $2.79. The phone company charges them a $30 {{overdraft}} fee, causing the cheque for their gas bill to bounce, and both services are scheduled to be cut off. Immediately after finding this out, their power goes off. Bret ends up selling his guitar to pay the bills, and he performs on stage with Jemaine while playing air guitar and making guitar sounds. Murray writes up his negative opinion of the show in the New Zealand consulate newsletter, giving them [...] "two stars out of 100". When Bret asks Murray for some of the emergency band fund, Murray tells him that he invested the money with a Nigerian man named Nigel Seladu who contacted him over the internet. Nigel promised Murray his money back with [...] "a thousand percent interest" [...] and [...] "a share of his family fortunes". Jemaine and Bret are certain that this is merely a scam.|$|E

Still, as with other modern Android phones, {{there are other ways}} to connect peripherals. For example: Bluetooth keyboards and many Bluetooth mice work with <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and a compatible monitor or TV can be connected using a compatible Mobile High-Definition Link cable. Alternatively, it may be possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> owner to [...] "attach" [...] a personal computer's keyboard, mouse, and monitor using an app such as TeamViewer QuickSupport.|$|R

2500|$|The right-hander {{originally}} {{signed a}} letter of intent {{to play for the}} University of Miami, which offered him a scholarship. [...] The day of the 1996 draft, he was pitching in a high school playoff game, so his mother stayed home to wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> call, and then showed up at his game in the second inning. [...] She relayed the message that he had been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round, the 35th selection overall. [...] Marquis was excited, and his team won the game and {{went on to win the}} city championship. [...] He then opted out of his letter of intent, and signed with the Braves on July 18, 1996, for a reported $600,000 ($ today) signing bonus.|$|E
2500|$|Voice quality {{can still}} vary from call to call, but is often equal to {{and can even}} exceed that of {{traditional}} calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include emergency telephone number dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, {{but it is not}} universally available. Older traditional phones with no [...] "extra features" [...] may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a backup power source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include Ventrilo and Teamspeak. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Mobiline {{tried to}} acquire Kenneth Duremdes through free agency, but Alaska matched Mobiline's offer sheet of a {{reported}} 48 million pesos, and Duremdes {{stayed with the}} Aces. The Phone Pals drafted former Manila Metrostar Gilbert Demape, but the Phone Pals, for the sixth time in seven conferences, were eliminated by top seed Shell in the quarterfinals. In the Commissioner's Cup, the Pals bannered Michigan University standout Jerod Ward, who exploded for 61 points in his debut. Later, Taulava returned to the Philippines after an approval by the Justice Department; despite this, the Phone Pals failed {{to get past the}} quarterfinals.

2500|$|Having devoted most of {{his time}} to the {{jurisdictional}} arguments, he asked for some time to speak about the merits near the end. [...] "If we only knew what the school board would have done but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> call ," [...] Gottesman suggested, [...] "we know how to ... deal with this case." [...] The Court should follow precedent from civil-rights and labor law and put the burden of proving that on the defendant. Otherwise, [...] "every school board that wants to fire someone for a First Amendment reason, well ... no teacher can teach for five years without doing something somebody would find objectionable. Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they'll tack on two or three other reasons." [...] At a justice's prompting, he likened it to the harmless error rule in appellate review.|$|E
2500|$|Fonda {{was brought}} up as a Christian Scientist, though he was baptized an Episcopalian at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Grand Island. [...] He said, [...] "My whole damn family was nice." [...] They were a close family and highly supportive, {{especially}} in health matters, as they avoided doctors due to their religion. Despite having a religious background, he later became an agnostic. Fonda was a bashful, short boy who tended to avoid girls, except his sisters, and was a good skater, swimmer, and runner. He worked part-time in his father's print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> company. He also enjoyed drawing. Fonda {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts of America; Teichmann reports that he reached the rank of Eagle Scout. However, this is denied elsewhere. When he was about 14, his father took him to observe the lynching of a young black man accused of rape. This enraged the young Fonda and he kept a keen awareness of prejudice {{for the rest of his}} life. By his senior year in high school, Fonda had grown to more than six feet tall, but remained shy. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he majored in journalism, but he did not graduate. He took a job with the Retail Credit Company.|$|E
50|$|As a consequence, Bell {{customers}} {{still had}} to pay a monthly lease fee in order to rent <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> internal components, which remained the property and responsibility of the local Bell provider.
