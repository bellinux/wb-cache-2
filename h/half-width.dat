40|$|ABSTRACT] The {{absorption}} spectra of CO_ 2, CO, and N_ 2 O {{in the near}} infrared region were measured with a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer at room temperature to examine the uncertainties of the line parameters of the spectroscopic database. The line strengths and <b>half-widths</b> of these molecules were determined by a nonlinear least squares technique. We compared our results with the values compiled in the HITRAN databases. Large differences between the measured line strengths and the compiled ones in the HITRAN databases were found for the weak bands of each molecule. Air-broadened <b>half-widths</b> of CO_ 2, CO, and N_ 2 O, which were calculated with measured N_ 2 - and O_ 2 -broadened <b>half-widths,</b> were close {{to the values of}} the HITRAN 96 database.

40|$|The Robert-Bonamy {{formalism}} {{has been}} {{commonly used to}} calculate <b>half-widths</b> and shifts of spectral lines for decades. This formalism is based on several approximations. Among them, two have not been fully addressed: the isolated line approximation and the neglect of coupling between the translational and internal motions. Recently, we {{have shown that the}} isolated line approximation is not necessary in developing semi-classical line shape theories. Based on this progress, {{we have been able to}} develop a new formalism that enables not only to reduce uncertainties on calculated <b>half-widths</b> and shifts, but also to model line mixing effects on spectra starting from the knowledge of the intermolecular potential. In our previous studies, the new formalism had been applied to linear and asymmetric-top molecules.

As expected, the inversion splitting induces a complete failure of the isolated line approximation. We have calculated the complex relaxation matrices of selfbroadened NH 3.
