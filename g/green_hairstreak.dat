5|$|The <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The various {{habitats}} provide {{homes to}} numerous species of insects. There are 700 moth species {{recorded in the}} nature reserve, again {{a quarter of the}} national total. At different spots across the site butterflies (including the <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak),</b> damselflies (like the large red), and dragonflies (such as the hairy dragonfly) can be observed. According to a 2005 report, the exceedingly rare thirteen-spotted ladybird (Hippodamia 13-punctata) was recently observed at the head, the first sighting in the UK since 1952.|$|E
5|$|The <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E

5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
25|$|Other notable insects {{include two}} other moths, {{northern}} drab, Orthosia opima, and dingy shell, Euchoeca nebulata, and a butterfly, the <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> Callophrys rubi. Another butterfly, the small pearl-bordered fritillary, Boloria selene, {{used to be}} common at Waldridge Fell but within County Durham is now confined to only four locations, all on heathland at around 300metres above sea level.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and alder kitten (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} soldier beetle species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, speckled wood and tortoiseshell.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} a {{wildlife}} garden, woodland, meadows and lakes. Over 350 species of flowering {{plants have been}} recorded, and 30 butterflies including white admirals, <b>green</b> <b>hairstreaks,</b> marbled whites and grizzled skippers.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} a dump for motor {{vehicles}} until 1976, when it was acquired by Wycombe Council. The Chiltern Society took over the management in 2013. It is steeply sloping chalk grassland with a diverse range of species, including birds such bullfinches, blackcaps and garden warblers, are butterflies such as dingy, grizzled skippers and <b>green</b> <b>hairstreaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly. The {{caterpillars}} {{are not known}} to be tended by ants like some lycid larvae but the pupae, which are formed at ground level, emit squeaks which attract ants and {{it is thought that}} ants will always bury any that are found. <b>Green</b> <b>hairstreaks</b> overwinter as pupae and are univoltine, having one generation of adult butterflies per year.|$|R
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
2500|$|The town's two {{parks are}} the main open spaces in the town centre. Cheetham Park was opened in June 1932 to a crowd of 15,000 people. The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his {{collection}} of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham's Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood {{was one of the}} first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a cut-over, lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and cross-leaved heath. Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the <b>green</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road. Car parking is available in Stalybridge Celtic FC's car park. The reserve occupies [...]|$|E
