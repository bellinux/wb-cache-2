According to Hoover, it created large numbers of files on [...] "individuals, groups, and organizations <b>engaged</b> in <b>subversive</b> activities", including espionage, and enabled the Bureau to immediately identify potential threats.

Robert Macfarlane was Deakin's literary executor. He commented:"Roger was one of those rare people whose character and passion {{is to be found in}} everything he made, collected, drew or wrote. His notes, written to himself, provide an insight into a beautiful mind and a sweet man.

50|$|Because of {{a casual}} remark made by Russel Crouse, Laurents {{was called to}} Washington, D.C., to account for his {{political}} views. He explained himself to the House Un-American Activities Committee, and his appearance had no obvious impact on his career, {{which at the time}} was primarily in the theatre. When the McCarran Internal Security Act, which prohibited individuals suspected of <b>engaging</b> in <b>subversive</b> activities from obtaining a passport, was passed in 1950, Laurents and Granger immediately applied for and received passports and departed for Paris with Harold Clurman and his wife Stella Adler. Laurents and Granger remained abroad, traveling throughout Europe and northern Africa, for about 18 months.|$|R

25|$|Immigration law {{was also}} {{tightened}} under the Patriot Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), {{also known as}} the McCarran-Walter Act, was passed by Congress in 1952 and was designed to restrict immigration into the U.S. It allowed the government to deport immigrants or naturalized citizens <b>engaged</b> in <b>subversive</b> activities and also allowed the barring of suspected subversives from entering the country. The Act is codified under Title 8 of the United States Code, which primarily governs immigration and citizenship in the United States. Prior to the INA, a variety of statutes governed immigration law but were not organized within one body of text. The Act was later modified by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and then by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Since the Patriot Act, Title 8 has been modified even further by various Acts, including the Real ID Act of 2005.|$|R

500|$|The McCarran Internal Security Act, {{which became}} law in 1950, has been {{described}} by scholar Ellen Schrecker as [...] "the McCarthy era's only important piece of legislation" [...] (the Smith Act technically predated McCarthyism). However, the McCarran Act had no real effect beyond legal harassment. It required the registration of Communist organizations with the U.S. Attorney General and established the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate possible Communist-action and Communist-front organizations so they could be required to register. Due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals, the act was never enforced, even with regard to the Communist Party of the United States itself, and the major provisions of the act were found to be unconstitutional in 1965 and 1967.

A few days later, Equatorial Guinea's foreign ministry sent a telegram to the State Department announcing that the two U.S. diplomats were barred from returning to the country.

5|$|In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught Guaraní and Spanish {{literature}} at the University of Toulouse. Although {{he had been}} allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly <b>engaging</b> in <b>subversive</b> activities. There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of Yo, el Supremo, I, The Supreme, published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos left his post at the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andrés Rodríguez.|$|R

After the Congress of Livorno of 1921, {{when most of the}} socialists of Trieste and the Julian March, both Italian and Slovene, joined the Communist Party of Italy, he withdrew from active politics.

40|$|Examining {{what might}} be {{described}} as Nasdijj’s "fake magical realist memoir" The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams, this paper is interested in how Nasdijj 2 ̆ 7 s text might be useful in contesting our understanding of the postcolonial literature of magical realism. Drawing attention to Nasdijj’s utilization of the “primitivist” conventions of magical realism, this paper will illustrate how fakery might be seen as essential not only to Nasdijj 2 ̆ 7 s text but also to magical realism. In fact, this paper argues that magical realist novels might be productively read as hoaxes, mobilizing what Graham Huggan describes as the "postcolonial exotic" in order to <b>engage</b> in a <b>subversive</b> act of “culture jamming”. The objective of the analysis is not to condemn magical realism along with Nasdijj’s opportunistic memoir, but rather to rescue magical realism from ideas about authenticity, celebrating its ironies and its challenges to colonial discourses of identity and history...|$|R
