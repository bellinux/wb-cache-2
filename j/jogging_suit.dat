5000|$|The {{members of}} De La Soul {{sit in a}} high school {{guidance}} counselor's office, lamenting that they have to take a class taught by Professor Defbeat.

[...] Trugoy, Posdnuos and Maseo arrive for Defbeat's class, in which he teaches the image-driven, mainstream style of hip-hop. Throughout the video, Posdnuos, Maceo, and Trugoy are teased by their fellow students and punished by Defbeat for sporting a unique style instead of conforming to the more popular hip-hop image.

50|$|The Jammer is the {{alter ego}} of Gordon “Gordie” Kirby, an {{otherwise}} normal guy who found he enjoyed patrolling the rooftops {{of his home}} city in a crime-fighting costume (a Sears <b>jogging</b> <b>suit,</b> modified by his sister to include a mask). He's not really a superhero, he often finds himself {{in the right place}} at the right time, and is compelled to act heroically. Sometimes he is hired to do good deeds. His own view of his goals is summed up by his desire “To dominate the world with peace, love, and free beer.” Through the course of his career, he has battled terrorists, an insane psychiatrist, and even servants of the Devil.|$|E

50|$|She had to {{overcome}} huge obstacles to compete internationally, the main objection being raised was how a Pakistani woman could race in a competition in which other women do not wear clothes that cover their body. Her parents, especially her father, encouraged her to run, but in the predominantly Muslim country she had to train in, {{it had to be}} done at 2:30 in the morning with a brother biking to pace her, because female athletes were not allowed to run on the road. She realized that if she qualified, she would have to wear a <b>jogging</b> <b>suit</b> while others wore shorts. Girls in Pakistan, when allowed to take part in sports, must wear such suits.|$|E

Joe; the figure had silk track shorts and short-sleeve shirt with trim (piping) and was produced by Rosko Industries of New York". Unlike today, figurines back then came with removable clothing.
