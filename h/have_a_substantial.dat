5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|The planet's {{most famous}} feature is its {{prominent}} ring {{system that is}} composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This {{does not include the}} hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The probe's {{objectives}} included flybys of Jupiter, Saturn and Saturn's large moon, Titan. While the spacecraft's course {{could have}} been altered to include a Pluto encounter by forgoing the Titan flyby, exploration of the moon, which was known to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> atmosphere, took priority. It studied the weather, magnetic fields and rings of the two planets {{and was the first}} probe to provide detailed images of their moons.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration are expected to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command {{was forced to}} withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless {{of the risk of}} a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{call for}} an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> number of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E
