50|$|The {{new method}} was {{compared}} with the self-acting spinning mule which was developed by Richard Roberts using the more advanced engineering techniques in Manchester. The ring frame was reliable for coarser counts while Lancashire spun fine counts as well. The ring frame was heavier, requiring structural alteration in the mills and needed more power. These were not problems in the antebellum cotton industry in New England. It fulfilled New England's difficulty in finding skilled spinners: skilled spinners were plentiful in Lancashire. In the main the requirements on the two continents were different, and the ring frame was not the method of choice for Europe at that moment. Mr Samuel Brooks of Brooks & Doxey Manchester was convinced of {{the viability of the}} method. After a fact-finding tour to the States by his agent Blakey, he started to work on improving the frame. It was still too primitive to compete with the highly developed mule frames, let alone supersede them. He first started on improving the <b>doubling</b> <b>frame,</b> constructing the necessary tooling needed to improve the precision of manufacture. This was profitable and machines offering 180,000 spindle were purchased by a sewing thread manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|Doubling of yarn {{where two}} or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many {{purposes}} where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of theses threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling winding machine, and {{two or more}} of these bobbins are placed on <b>doubling</b> <b>frame</b> (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights Water frames, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes ...|$|E
5000|$|Kenyon Taylor {{came to the}} {{attention}} of Albert Hall who was the personal assistant of Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti of the Ferranti company Manchester and joined them as a lab boy in March 1931. For some time, Ferranti had been contracted by J P Coats of Paisley to develop a very high speed cotton <b>doubling</b> <b>frame</b> but had been plagued for years with problems relating to the dynamic balance of tubular flyers. Working together with Dr Vincent Ferranti, Taylor eventually produced a solution described in his first British Patent 399,845. In the mid 1920s in order to produce their own valves (vacuum tubes) and to keep pace with the rapid expansion in radio technology, Ferranti had begun expanding their radio business at Stalybridge One of Taylor's early contributions to this effort was a diode pentode valve (tube) for use in radio receivers described in patent GB 412,693 [...] which was sold to the Patent pool [...] Hall and Taylor also produced and patented a system for improving the treble tone or sound of a radio with a novel adjustable filtering system.As well as working on radio, around 1933 Ferranti started to take an interest in Mechanical television and Taylor played a significant part in its development too. When Ferranti purchased shares in the Scophony company he produced a light source for the Scophony system [...] and a method to lock the picture to the transmitter. In 1934 during the manufacture of radio components, Taylor together with Arthur Chilcot produced and patented a cathode ray tuning indicator often referred to as a Magic Eye. Taylor was involved in the manufacture of cathode ray tubes and here he had several patents concerning electronic improvements and methods to apply the screen coatings. As well as making improvements to the focusing of these crts, he also patented a method of connecting them with a video signal. By 1935 Ferranti had acquired bigger premises at Moston and when Dr Vincent Ferranti employed Dr N H Searby as their Chief engineer, Taylor became their chief research engineer. In the mid 1930s the future of television broadcasting was decided by a committee set up by the British government 405 TV Trials. Dr Vincent Ferranti and Hall were called to the committee along with other television manufacturers to give their input. They argued for the case of keeping low definition TV in the north of England as they knew it would be a long time before high definition (405 TV) would become available outside London. However, the outcome was mechanical television of the Baird type was rejected in favour of an all electronic system demonstrated by Marconi-EMI. In 1936 Dr Searby employed an Oxford graduate Hubert Wood [...] who worked with Taylor on radio and television, but in the buildup to WW2, television development was put aside as they were assigned to work on a team developing IFF headed by F.C. Williams a scientist at TRE Bawdsey, in conjunction with James Rennie Whitehead. Several patents followed from this work and Hubert Wood refined the IFF Mark III seeing it into commercial production after the war. During the war food was important and Taylor produced a novel method of fast drying seeds or grain for which he obtained a patent with Frank Humber.|$|E

40|$|Framing {{effects are}} said to occur when {{equivalent}} descriptions of objects or events lead to different choices. Attribute frames refer to logically equivalent descriptions along a single dimension. For example, ground beef {{might be described as}} " 85 % lean" or, equivalently, " 15 % fat". Typically, one frame is positive and one is negative and people evaluate the object more favorably when presented with the positive frame (e. g., " 85 % lean" beef is viewed more positively than " 15 % fat" beef). This phenomenon is known as a valence-consistent shift in evaluations. However, missing from the literature on attribute <b>framing</b> is a <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> condition, in which positive and negative frames are presented together. Because some industries (e. g. the FDA) use the <b>double</b> <b>frame</b> as the standard for communicating, understanding how these frames are evaluated has practical implications. Additionally, how <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames</b> are evaluated has theoretical implications: The most common explanation of attribute framing, the Associative Account, predicts how <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames</b> will be evaluated. Such a prediction however, has not been well tested. This dissertation systematically explores the evaluation of <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames,</b> the implications for the Associative Account, and potential alternative explanations for such evaluations. Experiments 1 a - 1 d examine how <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames</b> are evaluated across stimulus and procedure differences including context, quantitative information, frame descriptors, response question, and response measure. These experiments reveal a stable, consistent, and surprising pattern of results in the evaluation of <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames.</b> Experiments 2 a and 2 b examine methodological factors common to most attribute frame experiments that may account for the observed pattern of <b>double</b> attribute <b>frame</b> evaluation, possibly by affecting frame saliency. Finally, Experiments 3 a and 3 b examine whether an alternative explanation for attribute framing, the Information Leakage Account, as well as linguistic cues, can offer insight into the observed pattern of results in the evaluation of <b>double</b> attribute <b>frames.</b> Taken together, this body of work demonstrates a novel, unpredicted pattern of evaluations of attribute frames and raises questions for the standard theoretical explanation of such effect...|$|R
