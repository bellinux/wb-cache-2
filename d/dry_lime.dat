40|$|In July 1996, the US Department of Energy (DOE) Kansas City Plant (KCP), AlliedSignal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), {{conducted}} field-scale {{tests of}} in situ soil mixing and treatment technologies within the Northeast Area (NEA) of the KCP at the Former Ponds site. This demonstration, testing, and evaluation effort was conducted {{as part of}} the implementation of a deep soil mixing (DSM) innovative remedial technology demonstration project designed to test DSM in the low-permeability clay soils at the KCP. The clay soils and groundwater beneath this area are contaminated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily trichloroethene (TCE) and 1, 2 -dichloroethene (1, 2 -DCE).

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe aim of {{the project}} was to study the {{manufacturing}} of synthetic soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na 2 CO 3) on an industrial scale. Currently all Soda ash that is used in South Africa for manufacturing glass is imported at a high cost, and the company Nampak Wiegand Glass (South Africa) is investigating the possibility to locally manufacture synthetic soda ash. About 75 % of soda ash is synthetically produced from either the Leblanc process, Solvay process, Modified Solvay (Dual) process or <b>dry</b> <b>lime</b> process. This study concentrated on the Solvay process on a laboratory scale for eventual input into a larger pilot plant. The produced material was analyzed using analytical techniques such as FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy), Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). There are certain standard requirements for impurities in the soda ash, and this needed to be measured and determined what changes to the process will bring the impurities to the required minimum standard. Environmental issues around the manufacturing process were also studied. After completing of the laboratory experiments and the extraction of required data from the results, Nampak will use the information to decide on a followup to the building of a small pilot plant to further test and develop the engineering and economical aspects of a full plant. If successful a full scale manufacturing plant can be developed in South Africa for producing soda ash. This study thus will not only help Nampak Wiegand Glass in finalizing the decision to go ahead, but its result will also benefit other companies that use the soda ash in oil refining, water treatment, pulp and paper, chemical industry etc. Some parts of the work done will be proprietary to Nampak and subject to confidentiality agreement.

40|$|Lime {{has been}} used in {{construction}} for millennia, and its value, especially in the field of conservation architecture, has only recently been rediscovered. Lime mortars harden through carbonation, and this thesis is a study of that process. The research conducted has resulted in the development of two novel techniques for the measurement and detection of carbonation. The first technique is a method of thermogravimetric analysis which allows the carbonation profile to be measured within an acceptable time-frame. The second technique is the use of drilling resistance measurement to visualise the carbonation profile. The potential of elemental analysis to measure the carbonation profile has also been identified. It has been demonstrated that the lime/water ratio has less impact on the compressive strength of air lime mortars than had previously been supposed. The change in the pore size distribution of air lime mortars caused by carbonation has been studied, and a theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Five different forms of air lime binder were studied. The impact of these on the structural performance of the resultant mortars has been assessed. It was concluded that mortars made with lime putties perform better than mortars made with <b>dry</b> <b>lime</b> hydrate. Mortars made with dispersed hydrated lime appear to perform as well as mortars made with lime putties, but at a slower rate of strength growth. The use of extra mature lime putty does not appear to confer structural performance benefits when compared with ordinary lime putty. It has been shown that the use of calcitic aggregates can produce air lime mortars which perform as well as moderately hydraulic lime mortars. It is theorised that this phenomenon is not directly related to carbonation, but rather to a complex interaction of the granulometry, mineralogy, chemistry and porosity of the aggregate with the binder.

40|$|Single-rate and multirate sampled-data (SD) {{systems as}} well as linear time {{periodic}} (LTP) systems with discrete jumps are analyzed in the frequency domain. The focus of the analysis is both on rejection of disturbances and on robust stability properties. Due to the periodic behavior of LTP systems, a distinction is made between the performance frequency gain (PFG) and the robust frequency gain (RFG). The maximum power gain is computed for two different sets of input signals. In {{the analysis of the}} PFG a single sinusoidal signal v 0 e j w t is considered, while for the analysis of the RFG v 0 (t) e j w t is used as input, where v 0 (t) is a periodically time-varying complex vector. The RFG is related to current frequency response approaches for SD systems. In a parallel work, a semi-physical model is developed for an industrial <b>dry</b> <b>lime</b> slaking process. The model is based on mass and heat balances for two non-stationary ideal stirred tank reactors in series. It is shown how the total reaction rate is derived from the conversion rate for lime particles. The identification of the conversion rate is based on a number of batch experiments, where the temperature and water evaporation flow from the batch is continuously monitored. Experiments have also been performed on a pilot plant slaker. It is verified that the slaker can be modeled as two ideal tank reactors in series. The evaporation model is based on experimental data from the pilot plant slaker. The slaker model is simulated and compared to a step response experiment. An H ¥ -controller is designed for the lime slaker model using both continuous and discrete measurements. The design includes both H ¥ -synthesis and frequency analysis of the closed-loop system. An algorithm for the periodic solution of the Riccati differential equation with jumps, associated with the filtering update, is presented. A problem in LTP design is that the closed-loop system may never reach steady state when it is subjected to step disturbances. Instead the closed-loop system reaches a periodic steady state where the output oscillates. It is shown how weighting filters in the control design can be selected to avoid the oscillation problem...|$|E
40|$|The SNRB{trademark} {{test program}} {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} controlling multiple emissions from a coal-fired boiler in a single processing unit. The degree of emissions removals for SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates all exceeded the project goals. A high degree of removal for HAPs was also achieved. The SNRB system offers low space requirements, control of multiple pollutants, and operating flexibility. The pneumatic SO{sub 2 } sorbent and ammonia injection systems {{are expected to have}} high reliability because of their mechanical simplicity. Despite these advantages, the SNRB process may not be an economic choice for applications involving SO{sub 2 } removals above about 85 %. For lower levels of SO{sub 2 } removal, the projected economics for SNRB appear to be more favorable than those of existing processes which involve separate units for the same degree of control for SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates. Specific findings are summarized as follows: (1) SO{sub 2 } removal of 85 - 90 % was achieved at a calcium utilization of 40 - 45 %, representing a significant improvement in performance over other <b>dry</b> <b>lime</b> injection processes. (2) When firing 3 - 4 % sulfur coal, compliance with the 1990 CAAA Phase I SO{sub 2 } emissions limit of 2. 5 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu was achieved with a Ca/S molar ratio of less than 1. 0. For the Phase II SO{sub 2 } emissions limit of 1. 2 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu, compliance was achieved with a Ca/S molar ratio as low as 1. 5. Phase II compliance is the more relevant emissions limit. (3) When using NaHCO{sub 3 } as the sorbent, the Phase II SO{sub 2 } emissions limit was achieved at a Na{sub 2 }/S molar ratio of less than 2. 0 (NSR < 1. 0). (4) Compliance with the Phase I NO{sub x} emissions limit of 0. 45 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu for Group 1 boilers was achieved at an NH{sub 3 }/NO{sub x} ratio of 0. 85, with an ammonia slip of 5 ppm or less. (5) Particulate collection efficiency averaged 99. 9 %, corresponding to an average emissions rate of 0. 018 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. This is significantly lower than the NSPS value of 0. 03 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. The high-temperature baghouse design incorporating an SCR catalyst for NO{sub x} reduction was demonstrated successfully. The technology is ready for commercial application. The key feature of the technology is control of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulates in a single process unit. However, this limits its commercial market to applications requiring control of all three components. Also, although the testing demonstrated greater than 90 % SO{sub 2 } capture, this was achieved at high sorbent/sulfur ratios. For applications requiring a high percentage of sulfur removal, a modern conventional FGD unit with LNBs for NO{sub x} control may be the preferred option...|$|E
