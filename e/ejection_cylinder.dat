40|$|Abstract: High {{precision}} forming of {{sheet metal}} stamping parts are required to control springback in sheet metal process, how to accurately predict and control the springback is a scientific problem for high-performance precision manufacturing. VBHF (Variable blank holder force) technology is an effective measure to control the springback of sheet metal, and {{the realization of the}} variable blank-holder force system is a difficulty. VBHF system mostly control the flow of servo valve to control the pressure of <b>ejection</b> <b>cylinder</b> so as to control the blank-holder force. The stability and real-time were influenced greatly by the precision of the valve and the control current instantaneous changes. This paper quotes PID control module based on the technology of fuzzy to control the VBHF. Its principle is based on PID controller to add a fuzzy control module. Application of virtual instrument LabVIEW software is to build the operating system and real-time data acquisition system. Through parameter, adjustment can meet the system's rapid, stable and robust requirements...|$|E

It consist of a frame with running wheels, rails, a central column for LPG and air, and a driving unit the carousel frame around the central column. The speed of the carousel {{can be adapted to}} the various filling times and capacities. The dimension of the carousel is important to consider for the future filling capacity. The carousel frame chosen can be equipped with a number of filling scales covering the present demand and also for the future demand. Filling carousel can be provided with equipment for automatic introduction and automatic filling scales with <b>ejection</b> of <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{presence}} of a ventilated rib atop the barrel and its outward similarity to the Colt Python, the King Cobra design is based upon that of an earlier Colt model, the venerable Trooper MK V, improved {{with the addition of a}} heavier-duty barrel, full barrel length <b>cylinder</b> <b>ejection</b> rod protection shroud, and the aforementioned thicker solid rib on top of the barrel. The King Cobra was introduced in 1986, discontinued in 1992, and returned to Colt's product line in 1994. Dropped a second time in 1998, it has not been produced since.|$|R
