5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E
500|$|The tentacles bear cilia (fine mobile hairs) {{on their}} edges {{and along the}} center. The beating of the outer cilia drives a water current from {{the tips of the}} tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food {{particles}} that collide with the tentacles are trapped by mucus, and the cillia down the middle drive this mixture {{to the base of the}} tentacles. A brachial groove runs round the bases of the tentacles, and its own cilia pass food along the groove towards the mouth. The method used by brachiopods is known as [...] "upstream collecting", as food particles are captured as they enter the field of cilia that creates the <b>feeding</b> <b>current.</b> This method is used by the related phoronids and bryozoans, and also by pterobranchs.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a sensor assembly having a current controller, a reference resistor and a <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> scaler. The sensor assembly further comprises a sensor element having an internal resistor, wherein the internal resistor of the sensor element and the reference resistor have a predetermined relationship with one another. The current controller {{is designed to}} provide a reference current through the reference resistor and, in response to a disturbance-induced change of the reference resistor, alter the reference current such that the voltage dropping across the reference resistor remains in a predetermined range around the applied target voltage. The current controller is further designed to provide a <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> to the <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> scaler and to alter said current by an amount of the <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> depending on the amount of the reference <b>current.</b> The <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> scaler is designed to feed a scaled <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> to the sensor element {{on the basis of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>current</b> in order to scale a voltage dropping across the internal resistor of the sensor element in accordance with the scaling of the <b>feed</b> <b>current...</b>|$|R

50|$|Bolinopsis {{infundibulum}} is {{a predator}} and sometimes occurs in swarms. The food is drawn towards the mouth by the <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> created by movement of cilia.

50|$|This simple {{realization}} requires rather high voltages (~100 V) to {{keep the}} load current constant with sufficient approximation for all practical purposes. Therefore, more complex versions of galvanostats, using electronic amplifiers with feedback and lower voltages, have been developed and produced.

5000|$|P. psammophila is {{a filter}} feeder and the lophophore {{is used in}} both feeding and respiration. It is orientated so that it faces the {{prevailing}} water current.

5000|$|Entoprocts {{generally}} use {{one or both}} of: ciliary sieving, {{in which}} one band of cilia creates the <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> and another traps food particles (the [...] "sieve"); and downstream collecting, in which food articles are trapped as {{they are about to}} exit past them. In entoprocts, downstream collecting is carried out by the same bands of cilia that generate the current; trochozoan larvae also use downstream collecting, but use a separate set of cilia to trap food particles.|$|E

50|$|Pyrosomes are planktonic, {{which means}} their {{movements}} are largely controlled by currents, tides, and {{waves in the}} oceans. On a smaller scale, however, each colony can move itself slowly {{by the process of}} jet propulsion, created by the coordinated beating of cilia in the branchial baskets of all the zooids, which also create <b>feeding</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
30|$|Preliminary {{laboratory}} observations {{revealed that}} most individuals of P. marinus were usually {{located near the}} bottom of the aquarium, creating <b>feeding</b> <b>currents,</b> making short movements in proximity to the bottom and swimming along the water column at night, similarly to other demersal species such as P. annandalei (Dur et al. [2010]) or Oithona colcarva (Ohlhorst [1982]).|$|R
50|$|In principle, coilguns {{can also}} be {{constructed}} in which the moving coils are fed with current via sliding contacts. However, the practical construction of such arrangements requires the provision of reliable high speed sliding contacts. Although <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> to a multi-turn coil armature might not require currents as large as those required in a railgun, {{the elimination of the}} need for high speed sliding contacts is an obvious potential advantage of the induction coilgun relative to the railgun.|$|E
50|$|Pleurobrachia pileus is a {{predator}} and feeds on such actively swimming prey as gammarid amphipods, crab zoeal larvae, barnacle cyprid larvae and calanoid copepods. Over {{much of its}} range it co-exists with another species of comb jelly, Bolinopsis infundibulum. The two species are found not to compete for food as their feeding habits differ. P. pileus remains motionless while it snares larger prey with its long tentacles, whereas B. infundibulum draws in a <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> of water and filters out the smaller, more weakly swimming, tiny zooplankton.|$|E
5000|$|Ecological {{factors were}} also {{probably}} {{a precursor to}} eusociality. [...] For example, the sponge-dwelling shrimp depend upon the sponge's <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> for food, termites depend upon dead, decaying wood, and naked mole rats depend upon tubers in the ground. Each of these resources has patchy distributions throughout the environments of these animals. This means {{there is a high}} cost to dispersing (individual may not find another source before it starves), and these resources must be defended for the group to survive. These requirements make it a necessity to have high social order for the survival of the group.|$|E
30|$|Through {{repeated}} observations using a zoom stereomicroscope, P. annandalei {{was shown}} to react to ciliates that approached its visual horizon, outside of which no reaction was observed independently of {{the distance from the}} first antennae.

50|$|Differently {{from the}} {{previous}} electric locomotives used on mountain lines, the new locomotives {{had to be able}} to vary their speed, a capability which at the time was problematic to achieve, due to the fact the three-phase motors spins at constant speed depending from the <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> frequency. The E.330 was designed to have four speeds (where the E.430 had only one and the contemporary E.550 two); this capability was obtained thanks to two patents by the German engineer Manu Stern and the Hungarian engineer Maurice Milch. The wheel arrangement chosen was 1-C-1, similar to that adopted on the contemporary 685 class of steam locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Pecten maximus {{frequently}} {{creates a}} slight hollow in the substrate for its shell {{to lie in}} by opening and closing the valve to eject water from the mantle cavity, which raises the shell {{at an angle to}} the substrate so that subsequent water jets into the sediment and create a recess. Once settled, sand, mud, gravel or living organisms coat the upper valve, and the margin of the shell, with the tentacles and eyes, is all that is visible. They are filter feeders which extract particles from the surrounding water via a <b>feeding</b> <b>current</b> which is drawn by cilia across the gills where the food particles are trapped, then taken to the mouth in a stream of mucous.|$|E

50|$|Platylepas ophiophila {{is found}} living in {{association}} with several species of sea snake as an ectosymbiont. The barnacle adheres to the snake's skin and ribs penetrate the skin to make the attachment more secure. Nevertheless, the barnacle usually becomes detached when the snake sheds its skin. Barnacles breed by internal fertilisation, so individuals of this species have to be located adjacent to another individual in order to reproduce. Despite the fact that sea snakes are mobile, and generally solitary, about half the sea snakes support barnacles. The barnacle may have adopted this lifestyle {{as a result of}} intense competition for space on coral reefs, rocks and other hard substrates; the advantages for the barnacle are freedom from predators, freedom from competitors, mobility, a <b>feeding</b> <b>current,</b> and possibly food fragments discarded by its host.|$|E
