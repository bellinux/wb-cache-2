5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy.|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drowned—if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drowned—if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E

She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful.

2500|$|One of Evans' {{distinctive}} harmonic traits is {{excluding the}} root in his chords, leaving this {{work to the}} bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sitting here playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine." [...] This idea had already been explored by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Red Garland. In Evans' system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color. Most of Evans' harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings. Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano. Laying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, {{and at the same}} time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.|$|E
