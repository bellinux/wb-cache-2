The conventional interlayer has been replaced by a nickel nanoparticle (NiNP) film without any MPDs for <b>diffusion</b> <b>brazing</b> of stainless steel 316 L laminae. Brazing was carried out in a uni-axial vacuum hot press at temperatures 750 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C; at a bonding pressure of 10 MPa; at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and dwell times of 1 and 2 hrs at each temperature. Comparison among the conventionally diffusion bonded, diffusion brazed and NiNP diffusion brazed samples is made with regard to microstructural evolution, diffusional profile and bond strength. Taken together, the results show that NiNP-assisted diffusion brazed samples have continuous bond line with low void fraction and high shear strength compared to conventionally diffusion bonded and brazed samples.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Microchannel process {{technology}} (MPT) offers several advantages {{to the field}} of nanomanufacturing: 1) improved process control over very short time intervals owing to shorter diffusional distances; and 2) reduced reactor size due to high surface area to volume ratios and enhanced heat and mass transfer. The objective of this thesis was to consider how nanomaterials, produced in part using MPT, could be used to solve problems associated with the fabrication of MPT devices. Specifically, many MPT devices are produced using transient liquid-phase brazing involving an electroplated interlayer consisting of a brazing alloy designed for melting temperature suppression. Unfortunately, these alloys can form brittle secondary phases which significantly reduce bond strength. In contrast, prior efforts have shown {{that it is possible to}} leverage the size-dependent properties of nanomaterials to suppress brazing temperatures. In this prior work, thin films of off-the-shelf elemental nanoparticles were used as interlayers yielding joints with improved mechanical properties. In the present investigation, efforts have been made to characterize the synthesis and deposition of various elemental nanoparticle suspensions for use in the transient liquid-phase brazing of aluminum and stainless steel. Advances were used to demonstrate the nanoparticle-assisted <b>diffusion</b> <b>brazing</b> of a microchannel array. In the first section, a silver nanoparticle (AgNP) interlayer was produced for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>brazing</b> of heat exchanger aluminum. Efforts are made to examine the effect of braze filler particle size (5 nm and 50 nm) and processing parameters (heating rate: 5 ºC/min and 25 ºC/min; brazing temperature: 550 ºC and 570 ºC) on thin coupons of diffusion-brazed 3003 Al. A tensile strength of 69. 7 MPa was achieved for a sample brazed at 570 °C for 30 min under 1 MPa with an interlayer thickness of approximately 7 μm. Further suppression of the brazing temperature to 500 ºC was achieved by sputtering a 1 µm thick layer of Cu before depositing a 5 nm thick film of AgNPs resulting in a lap shear strength of 45. 3 ± 0. 2 MPa. In the middle section of this thesis, several techniques are investigated for the synthesis of sub 10 nm diameter nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) to be used in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>brazing</b> of 316 L stainless steel. The average NiNP size was varied from 9. 2 nm to 3. 9 nm based on the synthesis technique, solvent and reducing agent used. Conventional wet-chemical synthesis using NiCl₂. 6 H₂O in ethylene glycol (solvent) and N₂H₄. H₂O (reducing agent) resulted in the formation of 5. 4 ± 0. 9 nm NiNPs. Continuous flow synthesis using a microchannel T-mixer (barrel diameter of 521 µm) and a 10 second residence time of reactants in a bath temperature of 130 ºC resulted in a particle size of with 5. 3 ± 1 nm. To make the synthesis safer and less energy intense, microwave heating was used along with less toxic Ni(CH₃CO₂) ₂· 4 H₂O (nickel salt), propylene glycol (solvent) and NaPH₂O₂ (reducing agent) yielding 3. 9 ± 0. 8 nm diameter NiNPs. For the final section, nickel nanoparticles were synthesized using NiCl₂. 6 H₂O (nickel salt), de-ionized water (solvent), NaBH₄ (co-reducing agent), N₂H₄. H₂O (reducing agent) and polyvinylpyrolidone (capping agent) yielding 4. 2 ± 0. 6 nm NiNP.
