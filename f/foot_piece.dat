In 1994, the Retsof Salt Mine was the largest salt mine in North America, and the second largest in the world. Mining activities had caused the collapse of a 500 by 500 <b>foot</b> <b>piece</b> of the mine ceiling at a depth of 1,200 feet below the surface. The collapse of the shale ceiling rock compromised the caprock layer separating the mine from overlying ground water, and the mine began to flood. The failure caused a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that was felt on the surface, as well as release of natural gases, declining aquifer levels and surface subsidence. [...] An ESG seismic system was installed using boreholes and surface-based sensors to evaluate the integrity of the mine as it flooded and track the sinkhole generated at the surface.|$|E

50|$|Late in the {{evolution}} of riding gear, giant trappings make an appearance mainly as status symbols. Giant trappings were merely show pieces and there was almost no possibility that they were worn, as these giant trappings would not have paired nicely at the time with the small physical size of horses that would have been ridden in Japan. Among the giant trappings found in Fujinoki, the characteristics of the stirrups recovered resembled that of a sixth-century style. Unlike the stirrups in other sites, the example discovered in Fujinoki was decently-preserved and the features were actually recognizable. This example consisted of three slightly curved bars that joined at the top to complete a bronze frame that was floored by a <b>foot</b> <b>piece</b> made of wood. Additionally, an attachment was made by a linked chain connecting to a strap that crossed the back of the saddle. Unfortunately, the stirrup found in Fujinoki is broken and multiple, large parts are missing that would have composed the remains of the reinforcing frame. The giant trappings were merely show pieces and the extent of their use may have been solely as burial goods.|$|E

All patients were instructed in daily pin site care, which was simply by showering daily [7]. All patients participated in physical therapy daily until they were discharged and twice a week thereafter. Walking was encouraged to help to improve circulation and fitness of the patient [8]. The hospitalization period lasted between 7 and 10  days until patients were familiar with the distraction or correction regime and were mobilizing comfortably full weight bearing with crutches.

The calming effect of pink if appropriately applied, relaxes hostile or agitated behavior in approximately ten to fifteen minutes. In 1978, Glen Wylie of Santa Ana, California, showed John N. Ott, noted photo-biologist, a Kinesoid experiment utilizing the colors pink and blue. If a two foot by three <b>foot</b> <b>piece</b> of bright pink construction paper is placed in front of a subject's eyes, the response is a significant loss of muscular strength. In the experiment, the subject stretches his arm straight out in front of his body, thereby creating a 90 ° angle. The ex-perimenter's goal is to bring the subject's arm down to the hips.

In 1940 he described his technique of closed intramedullary nailing in patients; World War II presented the opportunity to German surgeons to try this procedure on a large scale. After the war, because of difficulties in obtaining reduc-tion by the closed method, open techniques were evolved. Not until recently with the development of sophisticated and expensive equipment has it been possible to carry out closed techniques in this country on a large scale. The equipment includes a mo-bile fluoroscopic image intensifier with a television monitor and an extension frac-ture table which provides access to the fracture site for the image intensifier (Fig. I), FIG. 1 The patient is in the operating position on the extension table, the arrow emphasizes the ap-parent internal rotation of the left lower extremity needed to prevent an external rotation de-formity.

40|$|Bits {{flowing through}} the wires of a {{computer}} network are ordinarily invisible. But a radically new tool shows those bits through motion, sound, and even touch. It communicates both light and heavy network traffic. Its output is so beautifully integrated with human information processing that one does not even need {{to be looking at}} it or near it to take advantage of its peripheral clues. It takes no space on your existing computer screen, and in fact does not use or contain a computer at all. It uses no software, only a few dollars in hardware, and can be shared by many people at the same time. It is called the "Dangling String". Created by artist Natalie Jeremijenko, the "Dangling String" is an 8 <b>foot</b> <b>piece</b> of plastic spaghetti that hangs from a small electric motor mounted in the ceiling. The motor is electrically connected to a nearby Ethernet cable, so that each bit of information that goes past causes a tiny twitch of the motor. A very busy network causes a madly whirling string with a characteristic noise; a quiet network causes only a small twitch every few seconds. Placed in an unused corner of a hallway, the long string is visible and audible from many offices without being obtrusive. It is fun and useful. The Dangling String meets a key challenge in technology design for the next decade: how to create calm technology. We have struggled for some time to understand the design of calm technology, and our thoughts are still incomplete and perhaps even a bit confused. Nonetheless, we believe that calm technology {{may be the most important}} design problem of the twenty-first century, and it is time to begin the dialogue. ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION It {{is known}} from animal studies that muscle {{composition}} {{can be altered}} in response to different patterns of usage or stimulus (2). However, in man the effects {{of different types of}} training on muscle fibre type composition have not achieved a common agreement. This is partly due to the difficulty in controlling the stimuli the muscle receives because the training stimuli can only be superimposed on the daily activities usually undertaken. The muscles of spinal cord injured individuals provide a unique model for studying the process and mechanism of specific training effect, since these muscles are in a highly detrained state containing a low proportion of type I fibres/myosin heavy chain (MHC) -I isoforms (1, 3, 4, 5), and because the stimuli received by the muscles can be more closely controlled by the investigators. The purpose of present study was to investigate the effects of chronic low frequency electrical stimulation training on the contractile properties and muscle composition of the tibialis anterior muscle in a group of spinal cord injured individuals. This paper reports the preliminary results of muscle contractile property changes after four weeks of training. METHODS Five male paraplegic subjects, aged 29 to 48 years, with 5 to 12 years post spinal cord injury, gave their consent {{to participate in the study}} which was approved by the local ethical committee. The subjects were trained in the laboratory under supervision, five days a week for four weeks. The training was carried out on a custom build device that held the leg in a position of knee joint angle of 90 deg and ankle joint angle of 10 deg of plantar flexion. A rigid <b>foot</b> <b>piece</b> was applied on the dorsum of the foot to restrict any movement of the foot and toes, and to provide a resistance to dorsiflexion when the anterior tibialis muscle was stimulated. Percutaneous electrical stimulation was provided by a Uni-Tens 2031 Stimulator (ASAH medico, Denmark), with the stimulation electrodes placed over the motor point area of the muscle. Surface EMG electrodes were placed on the muscle belly to record M-waves. Force responses were monitored using a sensitive strain gauge force transducer attached to a analogue-to-digital converter. The training stimulation frequency was 10 Hz, with a duty cycle of 5 s on and 5 s off, and a pulse width of 350 us and current of 60 to 75 mA. This intensity was equivalent to approximately 60 - 70...|$|E
