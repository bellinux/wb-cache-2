Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like <b>her</b> <b>today.</b> She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Ritvo {{was born}} February 13, 1969, to Peter and Mary Petro. [...] Her family was {{involved}} in horse racing, and she was raised in Braintree, Massachusetts. [...] Her parents owned race horses, and after other small business ventures, her father purchased a race track. [...] Her three brothers all established horse racing careers: Michael became a race horse trainer and brothers Louis and Nick became jockeys. Ritvo herself is jockey-sized, standing only 4' 11", and weighing under 100 pounds. [...] She worked for her father as a teenager as a groom, hot walker and exercise rider. She became a licensed trainer when she was 18. Her nephew, Nick Petro, Jr., works for <b>her</b> <b>today</b> as an exercise rider.|$|E

2500|$|According to legend, a young Indian {{woman named}} Mirra was kidnapped by Portuguese pirates {{and taken to}} Cochin (modern-day Kochi), {{in the south of}} India. There, she escaped her kidnappers and took refuge in a Jesuit mission, where she was baptized with the name Catarina de San Juan. Mirra was again kidnapped by the same pirates that had taken her from her birth parents, and in Manila they {{delivered}} her to the merchant who later took her to New Spain. Once in Acapulco, she was sold to a Puebla merchant by the name of Miguel de Sosa. Through her life, Catarina or Mirra continued to dress in a sari. It is possible that is this gave rise to the [...] "china dress" [...] that became popular in Mexico in the 17th century. A few years after her arrival in Mexico, Miguel de Sosa died, providing in his will for the manumission of his slave. She was taken in by a convent, where it is said she began to have visions of the Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. The [...] "China Poblana" [...] died on 5 January 1688 at the age of 82. In Puebla, she was venerated as a saint until 1691, when the Mexican Inquisition prohibited open devotion to <b>her.</b> <b>Today,</b> the Templo de la Compañía, in Puebla, is known as La Tumba de la China Poblana because in its sacristy lie the remains of Catarina de San Juan.|$|E
2500|$|Dishevelled and restless, Chimène enters {{followed}} by Elvire and her other ladies. She is in despair about the terrible choice {{she has been}} forced to make, but she strongly believes Rodrigue can never be defeated in combat. Rodrigue arrives to say goodbye for the last time and tells her that he will never dare to raise his sword against anyone who fights in her name. He will let himself be killed, with no fear for his honour: people will only say that, conquered by Chimène, and with no hope of changing her mind, he had preferred to die rather than live with the burden of her hatred. Chimène begs Rodrigue to avoid falling prey to Don Sanche, because she cannot bear the prospect of Sanche's bloodstained hand taking hers in marriage. She urges him to remember that she will be the prize of the winner. Reassured by his beloved's words, Rodrigue leaves, declaring his desire for victory (Scene 2). Left alone with her entourage, while the trumpets announcing the duel are heard in the distance, Chimène performs a [...] "mad scene", in which she believes she is seeing the events of the fight, and faints in the arms of her ladies as she imagines Rodrigue mortally wounded (Scene 3). Don Sanche enters bearing Rodrigue's sword, but he is prevented from speaking by the curses of Chimène, who calls him a hateful murderer (Scene 4). The king appears with his entourage and Chimène throws herself at his feet, confessing her unchanging love for the slain Rodrigue, and begging him to spare her the shame of having to marry the man who is guilty of his death. But the king is adamant and declares that any resistance {{on the part of the}} girl is in vain, inviting her to willingly accept the groom he will give <b>her</b> <b>today</b> (Scene 5). Rodrigue then enters: he had defeated Don Sanche, but he had spared his life, sending him instead to offer Chimène the conqueror's sword, and he now asks her to accept him as husband of her own free will, and not by right of conquest. Chimène, finally won over, surrenders to her love and the work ends with the customary final divertissement, with songs and dances in honour of the conqueror of the Moors and his bride (Scene 6).|$|E

6000|$|It {{opened on}} a long, commodious ante-room, {{of which the}} only arresting features, ordinarily speaking, were the rows of tall half-human {{mechanical}} figures that stood up on both sides like tailors' dummies. Like tailors' dummies they were headless; and like tailors' dummies they had a handsome unnecessary humpiness in the shoulders, and a pigeon-breasted protuberance of chest; but barring this, they were not much more like a human figure than any automatic machine at a station that is about the human height. They had two great hooks like arms, for carrying trays; and they were painted pea-green, or vermilion, or black for convenience of distinction; in every other way they were only automatic machines and nobody would have looked twice at them. On this occasion, at least, nobody did. For between the two rows of these domestic dummies lay something more interesting {{than most of the}} mechanics of the world.
