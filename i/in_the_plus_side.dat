During that time, the Pirates boasted a number of star players, {{including}} Baseball Hall of Fame members Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner, Pie Traynor and Arky Vaughan. But, apart from four second-place finishes, they resided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle- to lower-rung of the National League and were late in developing a farm system, the surest method {{at the time of}} attaining sustained success <b>in</b> baseball. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> Benswanger kept <b>the</b> team going through the Great Depression and brought back all-time great Honus Wagner to serve as a coach.|$|R
5000|$|... the GDP (PPP) {{per capita}} of Asturias stood at €22,640, or 90.2% of the European average of €25,100. This makes the region <b>the</b> 12th richest <b>in</b> Spain, a big {{decrease}} from the 1970s/1980s - {{the heyday of}} the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly {{regarded as one of the}} most prosperous regions in Southern Europe. Asturias has been growing below the Spanish national average since the decline of the mining industry, and grew just 0.82% <b>in</b> 2008, <b>the</b> lowest of all regions <b>in</b> Spain. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> unemployment <b>in</b> Asturias is below the average of Spain; at 8.43% it is also below the European average.|$|R
5000|$|This {{appointment}} {{was not well}} received <b>in</b> <b>the</b> senior public service echelons <b>in</b> Canberra. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> Hewitt {{had a reputation for}} having a formidable mind, a grasp of detail, a capacity to make quick decisions and an impatience with red tape. On the other hand, he had always stirred strong responses in those he dealt with, and was often considered brusque and impatient. But <b>the</b> major point <b>in</b> his disfavour was that he was never a part of the club of senior figures who lunched at the Commonwealth Club; they disliked him for setting himself apart from them. [...] Hewitt's {{appointment was}} also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same anti-traditionalist mould as that of the appointment of Ainsley Gotto as Gorton's senior personal adviser. She had a number of strikes against her: she was aged only 22, she had not had the extensive experience expected of a person in such a position, and she was a woman.|$|R
50|$|Early columns were {{constructed}} of stone, some {{out of a}} single piece of stone. Monolithic columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture. Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together. In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a centre hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins. The design of most classical columns incorporates entasis (the inclusion of a slight outward curve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides)</b> <b>plus</b> a reduction <b>in</b> diameter along <b>the</b> height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter. This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.|$|R
500|$|On 4 May, Benfica played Alverca at home, {{where they}} lost 0–2, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing of João Querido Manhã for Record, the fans [...] "burst into protests at the end, after they lost {{patience}} with the errors, passivity {{and lack of}} talent of the whole team.". On 13 May, Benfica went to Adelino Ribeiro Novo to face Gil Vicente. <b>The</b> game ended <b>in</b> a 3–0 defeat – their tenth loss within the league, matching their previous record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1996–97 season. As a result, the club was overtaken by Belenenses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league table. A week later, Benfica played host to Salgueiros in Da Luz. A final score of 1–1 saved Benfica from a record fourth straight loss, and gave the Porto-based side their first point all season against a top 7 team. Benfica played the last {{game of the season}} against Desportivo de Aves on the road. At one point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, the team was losing three-nil, but managed to equalize and finish with a four-all draw. Toni stated that [...] "Everyone did not do their best to avoid that a historic club slipped into a position that is not accustomed." [...] Benfica finished in a record-breaking sixth place after the 34-game season with a tally of 15 wins, 9 draws and 10 losses that, together, summed up to 54 points. They were ninth-lowest league-wide in goals conceded – 44 <b>in</b> all. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> they were fifth best <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league at goal-scoring, with a total of 54 goals.

50|$|Both, more {{strongly}} aspherized corrector and, especially, strongly aspherized fast mirror (into a rather unpopular type of aspheric shape) of the Wright are a fabrication disadvantage. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> Wright camera {{is only about}} half as long as an equivalent diameter Schmidt.

5000|$|Fudge uses {{customized}} [...] "Fudge dice" [...] {{which have}} {{an equal number of}} plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time ("4dF" [...] in Fudge dice notation), and for every <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from Fair to Good) and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a Good attribute is considered to be Great if the player were to roll two <b>plus</b> <b>sides,</b> one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>sides</b> and <b>the</b> remaining <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> raises <b>the</b> result by one step. The same Good attribute would be considered Poor if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as −, a 3-4 as [...] and a 5-6 as +.|$|R
