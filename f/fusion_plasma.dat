5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of <b>fusion</b> <b>plasma</b> from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E

The idea was picked up by Robert Bussard in 1983. His 1989 patent application cited Lavrentiev, although in 2006 he appears to claim to have (re)discovered the idea independently.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009 the Naval Air Warfare Center pre-solicited another {{contract}} for [...] "modification {{and testing of}} plasma wiffleball 7" [...] {{that appeared to be}} funding to install the instrumentation developed in a prior contract, install a new design for the connector (joint) between coils, and operate the modified device. The modified unit was called WB-7.1. This pre-solicitation started as a $200k contract but the final award was for $300k. In April 2009, DoD published a plan to provide EMC2 a further $2 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The citation in the legislation was labelled as Plasma Fusion (Polywell) – Demonstrate <b>fusion</b> <b>plasma</b> confinement system for shore and shipboard applications; Joint OSD/USN project. The Recovery Act funded the Navy for $7.86M to construct and test a WB-8. The Navy contract had an option for an additional $4.46M.
