40|$|ARTICLE HAS BEEN RETRACTED BY EDITORIAL OFFICE, UPON AN APPROVAL OF ALL AUTHORS The {{contaminants}} {{present in}} the atmosphere have a substantial impact on public health. Among contaminants, the most important are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This paper {{is focused on the}} possibility of continuous PAHs monitoring and the description of their vertical distribution using filters, which serve to purify the air before the determination of the greenhouse gases (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, CO, ozone) and Hg in air, continuously sampled at 8, 50 and 230 m at the atmospheric station Krešín near Pacov and elaboration of a simple and economical method of extraction of these filters. The station serves as a point for monitoring the occurrence and remote transport of greenhouse gases and selected atmospheric pollutants and for the measurements of basic meteorological characteristics. In December, 17, 2014, a sampling of 16 priority PAHs started and lasted until December, 9, 2015. Samples were taken approximately once a month. The maximum concentration of ΣPAHs was 15. 905 ng/m 3, measured at the height of 8 meters in the period of 11. 2. 2015 – 11. 3. 2015, the concentration of benzo[a]pyrene exceeded the <b>immission</b> <b>limit</b> in the period by more than 50 %. By the sampling, the hypothesis about decreasing concentration of PAHs with increasing height was confirmed, especially the decrease of heavier PAHs. The sampling has shown that it is highly desirable to use the meteorological tower for sampling of PAHs using PTFE filters either by including the active sampler itself, or by using pre-filters for tropospheric ozone and gaseous elemental mercury analysers.  </p...|$|E

At {{the same time the}} dust immission has been followed. Even at the sampling site with the highest dusts load, determined values clearly fall below preventive dust <b>immission</b> <b>limits.</b> Concentration of PAH, PCB and PCPh are largely local and time dependent. However, the general concentration level is definitely lower than in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Lower Main region. The seasonal dependency of PCB concentration points to contaminated soils as an emission source. From the similar concentration pattern of pentachlorinated phenol at all sampling stations it is assumed that this component is released by evaporation from contaminated materials.

40|$|Resumé Legal and Economic Instruments of Environmental Protection The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to outline legal and {{economic}} instruments of environ- mental protection. They {{are considered to be}} the most important instruments that are applying within environmental policy. This thesis is conceptually divided into three linked parts, in each of them I am trying to approach both instruments and demonstrate their application in the sphere of air pollution. They are preceded by brief introduction where I explain the impor- tance of environmental protection and outline how to reach it by using different instruments. Part One deals with the description of legal instruments as the basic instruments of the environmental policy. Legal regulation is primarily based on general legal rules and system of consents and permits based on individual administrative acts, all bac- ked by administrative or criminal sanctions. The another important function of legal regulation is fixing the standards (especially emission and <b>immission</b> <b>limits).</b> The end of this part points out the advantages and disadvantages of legal instruments. Part Two analyses the second instrument of environmental regulation-economic instruments. There are mentioned different types of economic tools: taxes, charges, subsidies, loans, deposit-refund system, [...] ...|$|R
