But even if the {{rejoinder}} be made, {{that we have not}} yet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in Germany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there is still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual surplus available for home investment can only be converted into a surplus available for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of work performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for domestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in foreign trade. We are back on the same question which faced us in our examination of the export trade--in what export trade is German labor going to find a greatly increased outlet?

From the inexhaustible mineral treasures in the earth, and from the equally inexhaustible shoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast, the working population of Cornwall derive their regular means of support, where agriculture would fail them. At the mines, the regular rate of wages is from forty to fifty shillings a month; but miners have opportunities of making more than this. By what is termed [...] "working on tribute," [...] that is, agreeing to excavate the mineral lodes for a per centage on the value of the metal they raise, some of them have been known to make as much as six and even ten pounds each, in a month. When they are unlucky in their working speculations, or perhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the shutting up of a mine, they still have a fair opportunity of obtaining farm labour, which is paid for (out of harvest time) at the rate of nine shillings a week. But this is a resource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage. A plot of common ground is included with the cottages that are let to them; and the cultivation of this, helps to keep them and their families, in bad times, until they find an opportunity of resuming work; when they may perhaps make as much in one month, as an agricultural labourer can in twelve.|$|E

With the {{increasing}} of the large-size and overload of highway transport vehicles, the riding {{quality and the}} service life of pavement engineering are facing with a rigorous challenge. According to maintenance experiences from various countries in the world, adopting a reliable pavement preventive maintenance (PPM) measure is an effective method to keep the pavement with a good service level with the less <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> The selection plan of the optimal measure {{is one of the}} critical aspects of the PPM technology. Whether a PPM measure is suitable or not is closely related to the PPM technical features, the pavement conditions and the traffic service levels. The purpose of the paper was to put forward the principle, method and procedure of the optimal PPM measure selection in terms of the specific features of asphalt pavements based on the decision matrix analysis and the equivalent annual cost method.

40|$|Conventional {{concrete}} {{used for}} construction has neither the inherent ductility nor durability {{to meet the}} requirements of modern infrastructure construction. With ageing highway and bridge infrastructure requiring a significant <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> it is prudent to explore utilization of so-called high performance materials that have the potential to outperform and outlast their conventional counterparts. This research program is built around the concept of creating a sustainable material that exceeds the performance of conventional concrete through a characteristic enhanced cracking resistance achieved by the introduction of discrete fiber reinforcement combined with an optimized level of workability. In an effort to meet the existing demand for high performance materials suitable for modern construction practice, self-consolidating features have been developed for a preexisting high performance hybrid fiber reinforced concrete. A parametric study was employed to maximize the fresh state performance benefits of chemical and supplementary cementitious material additives in conjunction with optimization of the fiber reinforcement to meet the flow criteria of self-consolidating type concrete. The resulting composite, Self-Consolidating Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SC-HyFRC), is tested under compression, tension and flexure loading independently and in combination with conventional steel reinforcement to illustrate the mechanical performance gains that can be achieved with such composites. The performance enhancements gained in each manner of loading are then combined in the material's application to a structural element that must be designed to undergo a substantial inelastic (cracked) response. The intrinsic durability of the SC-HyFRC material is tested against two environmental deterioration mechanisms which plague modern concrete. Due to the enhanced crack resistance present in SC-HyFRC, chloride-induced steel reinforcement corrosion is mitigated during both the initiation and the propagation phases. This mitigation is qualitatively and quantifiably measured by suppression of observable cracking and direct electrochemical measurements of the reinforcing steel surface. Similarly, the cracking resistance feature of SC-HyFRC and similar fiber reinforced cementitious composites is judged for mitigation capacity of alkali-silica reaction. The magnitude of internal cracking accompanying the swelling-induced expansion is measured by relative changes in structurally relevant concrete mechanical properties, compressive strength and elastic modulus, with fiber reinforced restraint of expansion observed to correlate well with mechanical property retention. As reinforcement corrosion and alkali-silica reaction are but two of many deterioration mechanisms that induce damage by way of internal expansion, the positive outcomes of SC-HyFRC testing are expected to be transferable to concrete durability in a holistic sense. The potential benefit of constructing critical infrastructure elements with such high performance materials is a two-fold gain in overall structural life cycle assessment, being better equipped to deal with multiple facets of loading placed on modern structures. This and similar research of SC-HyFRC and other such materials will hopefully validate the upfront costs necessary to build with materials that can generate outsized long term fiscal savings...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is to review the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the Twelfth Finance Commission with special {{reference}} to Kerala. It also critically examines the emphasis on fiscal deficit reduction without paying attention to its quality and finds that {{this has led to}} the Centre and the States resorting to a softer option of cutting productive capital and necessary maintenance and social sector expenditure. This is likely to have adverse consequences on equitable growth and to impede the process of relieving the economy of structural constraints on growth. There is an urgent need for analysing the quality of fiscal consolidation instead of focusing merely on quantity of reduction of deficits as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study hence suggests incorporating the concept of Quality of Fiscal Discipline. It is found that there has been an enlargement of the scope of Finance Commissions [since the Eleventh Finance Commission (11 th FC) ] into mandates for recommending mechanisms for achieving macroeconomic balance, equitable growth, and suggestions for disinvestments and privatisation, while its role in the traditional area of grant devolution has been restricted to non-Plan grants only. In fact, the enlargement of the role in the traditional area of grant devolution would be more desirable. There is sufficient scope for augmenting resource mobilisation from direct and indirect taxes at the Central level. Emphasis is to be placed on integrating services and manufacturing into a single CENVAT (Central Value Added Tax) and on direct taxes reform. The second generation tax reform should concentrate on States’ tax administration and inter-State coordination prior to moving on to a State level VAT. There is need for a constitutional amendment to place service tataxation in the Concurrent List and enable States to tax more services. On the expenditure side, steep increases in items like wages and salaries and interest expenditure are unlikely in the near future. Hence maintenance and social sector expenditure should not be sacrificed. At the same time, efficiency in spending and cutting unproductive expenditure and leakages should be strictly monitored. A decentralised district level monitoring system for maintenance <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> assets is also suggested. The paper argues that bringing privatisation in the Terms of Reference of the Finance Commission seems avoidable. It is also felt that more effective time bound implementation of State Finance Commission Reports is needed. Along with devolution of funds, transfer of administrative functions is necessary for avoiding duplication of expenditure. As for Kerala-specific issues, it is found that achievements on the human development front are not rewarded. Certain changes in the existing criteria (of the Eleventh Finance Commission) are hence suggested. Kerala’s tax effort, though better than richer States like Punjab, is facing structural constraints. The fast expanding services sector is outside the tax net of the State. The tax-GDP ratio of Kerala showed a mild decline at 9. 84 percent in the 1990 s as compared to 10. 29 percent in the 1980 s despite a much higher growth rate of State Domestic Product, mainly because the State was not able to tax the dominant sector of the State Domestic Product, that is, the services sector.

Using raster land cover data and county parcel data, we constructed a footprint of current development and simulated {{future development}} using a modified stochastic flood-fill algorithm. We modeled combinations of constraints from the 1996 County General Plan and parcel data—slope, stream buffers, oak canopy retention, existing development, public ownership, regional clustering, and acquisition programs—and overlaid development outcomes onto the land cover data. We then calculated metrics of habitat loss and fragmentation for natural land cover types. Rural residential development erodes habitat quality much more than habitat extent. Policy alternatives ranging from existing prescriptions to very restrictive regulations had marginal impact on mitigating habitat loss and fragmentation. Historic land parcelization limits mitigation of impacts by the current General Plan prescriptions that only apply when a parcel requires subdivision before development. County-wide ordinances were somewhat more effective in preserving habitat and connectivity.
