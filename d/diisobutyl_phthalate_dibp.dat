Phthalates are produced in high volume, over 470 million pounds per year (EPA 2006). Manufacturers use them in numerous industrial and consumer products, primarily as plasticizers in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) products. Many phthalates can potentially lead to high exposure, both individually and together with other phthalates. They can often substitute for each other in products. They are used in medical applications and have been detected in food. A number of phthalates appear in biomonitoring surveys of human tissues, evidencing widespread human exposure (CDC 2009).

The experimental group were administered by gavaj daily with 3 different dosages (0. 25 - 0. 5 - 1 ml/kg/day) of DIBP mixed with corn oil for 28 days. The liver tissue sections after rutin histological preparation processes were examined and photographed using an Olympus BX 51 light microscope. It was determined from the analyses that there was no significant histological difference between the control and the corn-oil fed control group. The group which was administered DIBP displayed deterioration in lobulation, focal hepatocellular necrosis, oedema in hepatic artery and vena centralis, decrease in glycogen and distortion of nucleus shape in relation to the dosage of DIBP they received.

The results further indicated that almost one-third (35.1  %) of BTEX migration is from the neck region of the balloon, whereas the contribution was about one-fourth for phthalate migration (24.6  %). A higher contribution from the neck region {{can be attributed to the}} increased thickness of the rolled up ‘lip’ region. This is directly linked to the amount of colored latex present in the region, leading to a higher migratory level. As the migratory levels were well above the maximum permissible levels from the neck region, it leads to a significant increase in the health risks associated when inflating balloons.|$|R
40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} can induce malformations and {{impairment of}} reproductive function in experimental animals {{and may have}} similar effects in humans. Recently, the environmental obesogen hypothesis was proposed, suggesting that environmental chemicals {{contribute to the development}} of obesity and insulin resistance. These effects could be related to chemical interaction with nuclear receptors such as the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). As several testosterone-reducing drugs are PPAR activators, we aimed to examine whether four PPAR agonists were able to affect fetal testosterone production and masculinization of rats. Additionally, we wished to examine whether these chemicals affected fetal plasma levels of insulin and leptin, which play important roles in the developmental programming of the metabolic system. Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed from gestation day (GD) 7 - 21 to <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DiBP),</b> butylparaben, perfluorooctanoate, or rosiglitazone (600, 100, 20, or 1 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Endocrine endpoints were studied in offspring at GD 19 or 21. DiBP, butylparaben and rosiglitazone reduced plasma leptin levels in male and female offspring. DiBP and rosiglitazone additionally reduced fetal plasma insulin levels. In males, DiBP reduced anogenital distance, testosterone production and testicular expression of Insl- 3 and genes related to steroidogenesis. PPARalpha mRNA levels were reduced by DiBP at GD 19 in testis and liver. In females, DiBP increased anogenital distance and increased ovarian aromatase mRNA levels. This study reveals new targets for phthalates and parabens in fetal male and female rats and contributes to the increasing concern about adverse effects of human exposure to these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Broadband {{dielectric}} measurements at {{very large}} hydrostatic pressures (up to 1. 8 GPa) {{are used to}} investigate the effect of molecular structure on the dynamical properties of supercooled di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and its isomer, <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DiBP).</b> At atmospheric pressure, both {{the shape of the}} R-relaxation loss peak and the fragility are essentially the same for the two materials, although the behavior of their â-relaxations differs. The activation energy for the â-process in DiBP, which is independent of pressure, is larger than that for DBP, while the activation volume of the former is about an order of magnitude larger. In contrast to the similarities of the R-relaxation at low pressure, distinct differences between the two isomers become evident at elevated pressure. The activation volume for the R-relaxation and the pressure coefficient of the glass transition temperature are significantly larger for DBP than DiBP. On the other hand, the fragility of both liquids is invariant to pressure. This latter observation corroborates recent results from high-pressure viscosity measurements on DBP, and is consistent with the invariance of the R-peak breadth to pressure. Related to the large value of the Kohlrausch stretch exponent and its invariance to pressure, there is no decoupling of the R-relaxation times and the dc-conductivity over the investigated range of temperatures and pressures. This is consistent with the idea that the decoupling of dynamic variables upon approach to Tg is a consequence of increases in intermolecular cooperativity and dynamic heterogeneity. We also compare herein the characteristic temperatures, and their associated relaxation times, at which various changes in the dynamics become manifest in the DBP and DiBP...|$|E
40|$|Total daily intakes of diethyl {{phthalate}} (DEP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DnBP), <b>di(isobutyl)</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DiBP),</b> {{butyl benzyl phthalate}} (BBzP) and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were calculated from phthalate metabolite levels measured in the urine of 431 Danish children between 3 and 6 years of age. For each child the intake attributable to exposures in the indoor environment via dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption were estimated from the phthalate levels in the dust collected from the child’s home and daycare center. Based on the urine samples, DEHP had the highest total daily intake (median: 4. 42 mg/d/kg-bw) and BBzP the lowest (median: 0. 49 mg/d/kg-bw). For DEP, DnBP and DiBP, exposures to air and dust in the indoor environment accounted for approximately 100 %, 15 % and 50 % of the total intake, respectively, with dermal absorption from the gas-phase being the major exposure pathway. More than 90 % of the total intake of BBzP and DEHP came from sources other than indoor air and dust. Daily intake of DnBP and DiBP from all exposure pathways, based on levels of metabolites in urine samples, exceeded the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for 22 and 23 children, respectively. Indoor exposures resulted in an average daily DiBP intake that exceeded the TDI for 14 children. Using the concept of relative cumulative Tolerable Daily Intake (TDIcum), which is applicable for phthalates that have established TDIs {{based on the same}} health endpoint, we examined the cumulative total exposure to DnBP, DiBP and DEHP from all pathways; it exceeded the tolerable levels for 30 % of the children. From the three indoor pathways alone, several children ha...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} {{and distribution}} of organic pollutants were investigated and their initial aquatic ecological risks were assessed in water of the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE). A total of 18 samples were collected from South Branch of YRE during the flood season in August 2012. Out of 956 organic compounds, 23 organic pollutants were detected by GC-MS and NAGINATATM software which were dominated by phthalate esters (PAEs), petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and substituted benzenes. The total concentration of detected 23 organic pollutants varied from 0. 585 to 53. 7 μg/L in the studied sites. Moreover, the total amounts of PAEs (∑PAEs), PHCs (∑PHCs) and substituted benzenes (∑substituted benzenes) were {{in the range of}} 0. 184 - 53. 344 μg/L, 0 - 0. 164 μg/L, and 0. 196 - 1. 559 μg/L, respectively. The study revealed that PEC/PNEC ratios of 8 organic pollutants were higher than 1 (PEC: Predicted environmental concentration; PNEC: Predicted no effect concentration), while 3 of them Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, octadecane and nonadecane were found to be > 100 and the remaining organic pollutants including <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> tridecane, dihexyl phthalate, methyl palmitate and methyl stearate ranged from 1 to 100.
