Nevertheless, the impact of the European policy is hampered, making it not possible to state that EU has normative power.

Nevertheless, there is no sound evidence for the covalent attachment of acrylic acid via a Si-C bond, and polymerization cannot be excluded. The rather high oxidation levels, although only small particles were used, indicate low (<b>insufficient)</b> functionalization <b>efficiencies.</b> Not only surface oxidation, but also ligands with a long chain length as well hamper the applicability of silicon nanoparticles in electric or electroluminescent devices because they prevent an efficient charge transport compared to short ones [18].

The environment literature highlights important environment issues in air, land and water, including deforestation, desertification, irreversible negative effects on biodiversity, and urbanization issues.

The negative impact of climate change in Burkina Faso is particularly worrying because of the country's dependence to subsistence agriculture, its high vulnerability to natural disasters, its lack of adequate healthcare and other adaptation/resilience capacities. Stakeholders, including Burkina Faso's government and donors in environment and development areas, acknowledge the urgent need of facing these challenges efficiently, the first of which seems to be deciding how to finance the environment strategies. Of the 8 ̆ 08 million needed per year, the government's investment in environment is less than 1 per cent.

Recent investigations suggested that US {{with the aid of}} microbubbles is a potential novel method for the gene therapy in various diseases, both in vivo [10, 11] and in vitro studies [12, 13]. It was addressed that gas-filled microbubbles were driven in US field, and induced shear stresses and sudden ruptures, which subsequently generated force and then punctured on the surrounding cells and tissues, which was termed as sonoporation [14]. Finally, reversible pores resulted from the force enhanced the permeability of the cell membrane temporarily and permitted foreign genes into cells [12, 15, 16]. Besides, endocytosis stimulated by US is another reason for the facilitation of this gene delivery system [17].

30|$|Renewable energy based {{distributed}} generation (DG) {{has the potential}} to reach high penetration levels in the residential region. However, its integration at the demand side will cause rapid power fluctuations of the tie-line in the residential region. The traditional generators are generally difficult to manage rapid power fluctuations due to their <b>insufficient</b> <b>efficiency</b> requirements and low responding speed. With an effective control strategy, the demand side resources (DSRs) including DGs, electric vehicles and thermostatically-controlled loads at the demand side, are able to serve as the energy storage system to smooth the load fluctuations. However, it is a challenge to properly model different types of DSRs. To solve this problem, a unified state model is first developed to describe the characteristics of different DSRs. Then a load curve smoothing strategy is proposed to offset the load fluctuations of the tie-line of the residential region, where a control matrix deduced from the unified state model is introduced to manage the power outputs of different DSRs, considering the response order and the comfort levels. Finally, a residential region with households is used to validate the load curve smoothing strategy based on the unified state model, and the results show that the power fluctuation rate of the tie-line is significantly decreased. Meanwhile, comparative study results are shown to demonstrate the advantages of the unified state model based load curve smoothing strategy.|$|E
