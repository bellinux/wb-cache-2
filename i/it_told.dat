Venturing into new territory, Morris also authored and starred in a play, The Tables Turned; Or Nupkins Awakened, which was performed at a League meeting in November 1887. <b>It</b> <b>told</b> the story of socialists who are put on trial in front of a corrupt judge; the tale ends with the prisoners behind freed by a proletariat revolution. In June 1889, Morris traveled to Paris as the League's delegate to the International Socialist Working Men's Congress, where his international standing was recognised by being chosen as English spokesman by the Congress committee.

Mahesh liked the script but suggested Jagannadh tweak the script's backdrop to suit the Telugu-speaking peoples' sensibilities. Jagannadh agreed and also replaced the existing title with Pokiri. Mahesh wanted the film's production to begin in 2005 allowing him to complete his current commitments. While he waited for Mahesh, Jagannadh directed Akkineni Nagarjuna in Super (2005). While reworking the script, Jagannadh took inspiration from Marana Mrudangam (1988) and State Rowdy (1989). Pokiri was produced jointly by Jagannadh and Manjula Ghattamaneni's production companies, Vaishno Academy and Indira Productions respectively, on a budget of 100120 million.|$|E

A paperback book titled Women's Barracks describing a woman's experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. <b>It</b> <b>told</b> of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.|$|E

25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that <b>it</b> <b>told</b> her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. They said they would continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E
