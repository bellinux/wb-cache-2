5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E

The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

If she had occupied the only kind and gentle Harriet's place in March {{it would have been a}} thrilling spectacle to see her invade the Boinville rookery and read the riot act.

5000|$|In Fumi Yomu Onna ( [...] , [...] "Woman {{reading a}} letter"), a woman reads what is almost {{certainly}} a love letter, per the expectations in ukiyo-e. Expectations would also predict the recipient to be a courtesan or young girl, but the woman's shaven eyebrows and teeth blackened with ohaguro show that she is married. She holds the letter close to her eyes and probably reads it secretly and in low light. The arch in her posture and <b>her</b> squeezing <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the letter suggest a conflicted emotional state brought on by a likely tangled relationship.|$|R

25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> depending <b>on</b> the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|R
50|$|Black Swan is a 2010 American {{psychological}} horror-thriller film {{directed by}} Darren Aronofsky, written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin, and starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around {{a production of}} Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, {{as well as the}} dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose <b>her</b> tenuous <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> reality and descend into a living nightmare.|$|R

The horror of his father's death causes James' powers to manifest for the first time, and he uses his claws to kill Thomas and injure Dog, before lapsing into shock. Elizabeth tells James [...] "Not you too" [...] (implying that something similar had happened to his deceased brother), rejecting him with disgust. James gets way and Rose follows after him.

She is overly obsessive with him and has hurt one of Toru's previous girlfriends by shoving her down a set of steps out of jealousy. <b>Her</b> fragile <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> reality was wounded by Yuujirou's claim that he and Toru are lovers- and that Toru is not interested in girls because of this.

60|$|It was {{the first}} night she and Billy had slept apart. She was amazed {{that she had not}} lain awake {{worrying}} about him. She lay with eyes wide open, scarcely thinking, until pain in her arm attracted her attention. It was where Billy had <b>gripped</b> <b>her.</b> <b>On</b> examination she found the bruised flesh fearfully black and blue. She was astonished, not by the spiritual fact that such bruise had been administered by the one she loved most in the world, but by the sheer physical fact that an instant's pressure had inflicted so much damage. The strength of a man was a terrible thing. Quite impersonally, she found herself wondering if Charley Long were as strong as Billy.|$|R

6000|$|About {{the time}} of the reorganization, Mrs. Eddy retired from her {{position}} of pastor of her Church, abolished the office of pastor in all branch Churches, and appointed her book, Science and Health, to be pastor-universal. Mrs. Eddy did not disconnect herself from the office entirely, when she retired, but appointed herself Pastor Emeritus. It is a misleading title, and belongs to the family of that phrase [...] "without a creed." [...] It advertises her as being a merely honorary official, with nothing to do, and no authority. The Czar of Russia is Emperor Emeritus on the same terms.

50|$|Brother Alex {{has managed}} to {{convince}} some of the Skangite inner council that Mother Hilda is trying to discredit him {{in order to secure}} <b>her</b> own <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> power; however, his allies are few, and the evidence against him is more damning than he’d led them to believe. When the extent of his crimes is made clear, his allies refuse to stand with him; too late, he realises that he’s gone too far, and Hilda has him excised from the group. As the council session comes to an end and what’s left of Alex is removed from the bungalow, one of the Skangites passes on word that the Doctor has arrived at the compound and is asking to speak with her. Hilda often engaged in philosophical debates with the Doctor before founding the way of the Skang, and she lets her old friend in so as not to raise suspicion. The Doctor probes for information without trying to seem to obvious, trying to find out how a rational sceptic could become such a devoted follower of the Skang; however, Hilda sees his questions for what they are and politely dismisses him—and, once he’s gone, she tells Brother Will that there is to be a change of plans.|$|R
40|$|This essay explores Margaret Thatcher’s {{political}} {{agency and}} leadership style {{in terms of}} her reliance on discursive and media strategies which thrived on the “confusion” of gender stereotypes and her ability to play with multiple, long-established archetypes of women in power, characterized by violent and aggressive femininity. Thatcher’s frequent self-projection as a “masculine” character, the “honorary man” of British politics, and <b>her</b> special <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> British public opinion and fantasies, were never disjointed from her ability to don, exploit, subvert and redirect “motherly’ (or at least “womanly”) performances at will, in order to serve her political agenda. Focusing on her strategic deployment of a rhetoric and discourses of aggression, divisiveness, conflict and war, the essay highlights Thatcher’s ability to re-create and keep alive the idea of a national community always under siege, where extraordinary economic, disciplinary and defence measure were required in order to resist and overcome domestic and foreign “enemies”. The Falklands War will be taken as case study, for it provides an outstanding example of Thatcher’s powerful revision of female political authority {{against the backdrop of the}} conventionally masculine, heroic imaginary of war. Her masterly and coterminous performances as war leader and “super-mother” of the nation allowed for a complex and hybrid self-projection which still acts as an empowering model whose disciplinary subtext entails a nostalgic investment in imperial national history...|$|R

Lindsay and Allison escape through the tunnel, and are met and sheltered by R.J. at Rae Cummings' empty house.

Allison is subdued, but while saving Viki, Antonio accidentally shoots Ben, which leaves him in a coma that ultimately leads to his death in 2004.
