40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 57 - 60). The taxation {{of international}} partnerships has particular relevance for South Africa. Zaaiman (2008 : 5) remarks that South African investors often have limited {{choice in the}} legal form of the entity in which they invest. Their lack of choice largely {{stems from the fact}} that the type of legal structure implemented internationally is shaped by the tax and commercial concerns relevant to the foreign jurisdiction in which such structure is established (Zaaiman, 2008 : 5). In South Africa, the taxation of partnerships has received very little attention. There is also no legislation in place dealing with this business vehicle. However, many South Africans are investing in offshore partnerships. There is accordingly a need to develop a comprehensive work on the taxation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Furthermore, on a domestic level, the recent judgment delivered in Grundlingh v CSARS raised several issues regarding the taxation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Of particular relevance to the common law of South Africa, is the yet unresolved tension which now seems to exist between the Grundlingh case and the well-established principles of the taxation of international partnerships as laid down by the then Appellate Division in the CIR v Epstein judgment. The comments made regarding partnerships in the CIR v Lever Bros 3 judgment also seems to conflict with the Grundlingh case. Bearing in mind the principle of stare decisis and the constitutional obligation to develop South African common law in line with international law, it is necessary that a body of work be developed to begin the process of reconciling South African sources of law into one coherent approach, to the taxation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships...</b>|$|R

40|$|Relative to the {{multinational}} {{headquarters in the}} US and Western Europe, the massive number of producers that these countries employ abroad have received relatively little attention in the literature. My research adds to this body of knowledge by specifically studying (1) who those producers are and (2) what technologies they use. To address question (1), the first chapter develops a theory where the choice between <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnership</b> and within-border partnership depends {{on the size of}} the gain through technology transfer from developed-country headquarters, and the second chapter provides empirical evidence. When developing-country producers have heterogeneous productivity, those with medium levels of productivity will gain sufficiently from technology transfer and choose <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnership.</b> In contrast, high- and low-productivity producers will work with their local headquarters, and the low-productivity producers will not be able to sell their products to developed countries at all. The third chapter addresses question (2) by comparing the productivity of production factors in Chinese electronics producers that are integrated with headquarters from different source countries. It finds that the productivity of skilled labor is higher in those with developed-country headquarters than those with emerging-economy headquarters, while the productivity of unskilled labor shows no such difference...|$|R

The issue of sector and geographic relatedness was reviewed using over 2, 500 cases of international acquisitions and joint ventures.

40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the global market and the rapid pace of technological development {{have led to the}} proliferation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships</b> among multinational firms. However, diversity in national backgrounds, management systems and work practices between partner firms can limit the development of robust co-operative relationships and impede the formation of integrated work teams. This study provides a concrete analysis of how the diversity in the technology management systems and work practices between a Japanese and British electronics firm has constrained their collaboration. It examines how the two firms attempt to co-ordinate the work of their engineers and analyses the limitations of their adaptive strategies. The paper argues that mutual adaptation and organizational learning can have only limited effect in accommodating some of the fundamental differences between the partner firms many of which are closely interwoven with diversity in national institutions and societal contexts. It also argues that â€˜integrationâ€™ and â€˜acculturationâ€™ do not really address the full range of the problems. Inter-firm diversity, although conflict-inducing, is also a source of competitive advantage for the partnership. Firms engaged in global collaboration must face the persistent tension between the need to preserve their core strengths and the pressure for global adaptation...|$|R
40|$|The European Union is {{becoming}} one undivided continent, where territories {{are faced with}} borderless economic, social and environmental challenges while still being governed through traditional institutional boundaries. Integration {{raises the question of}} cohesion among different territories, and territorial cohesion is a new objective for the Union according to the Lisbon Treaty. Cooperation between territories, beyond frontiers and across different institutional layers, {{is becoming}} crucial to provide multi-level governance to new functional regions. The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC), a new legal and governance tool established by Regulation 1082 / 2006, was conceived as a substantial upgrade for this multi-level governance and "beyond-the-border" cooperation. Three years after its adoption, a number of EGTCs have been set up, and new ones are in the pipeline. Despite their early stage, these new ventures are generating interesting dynamics, revamping inter-institutional <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships</b> and establishing a new cooperation geography. However, promoting best practice partnerships would require a broader European policy. This article considers possible institutional incentives such as the "contractualisation" of the cooperation between the European Commission and the EGTCs. These Groupings truly are new governance "contracts" of multilevel cross-border cooperation, which can become creative engines for local development and deeper European integration. This provides food for thought for the EU policy and budgetary package after 2013...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cross-border</b> <b>partnerships</b> are a {{distinctive}} example of inter-organizational cooperation, embedded, {{in terms of}} territory, in the neighboring borderland regions {{of two or more}} countries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify factors that contribute to the sustainable cross-border cooperation and affect motivation to increase cooperation between cross-border partners. The objective implementation is connected with the verification of a hypothesis referring to the possible impact of the European Union funds on the trans-boundary cooperation transformations. Results of desk research and quantitative research involving IDI, CATI, CAWI and CATI and PAPI data collection methods, implemented in the Polish–Czech borderland in 2016 were used in this paper. Research on the Polish–Lithuanian borderland was also used in the paper to conduct comparative analysis, useful to identify and evaluate factors motivating sustainable cross-border cooperation in the Czech–Polish borderland. The sustainable, cross-border and inter-organizational cooperation in the borderlands results from the simultaneous interaction of three groups of factors: (1) people and institutions (the quality of interpersonal relationships); (2) cross-border planning, procedures and support mechanisms (e. g., the possibility of jointly planning the cross-border cooperation and obtaining EU funds for the development of the borderlands as well as the availability of other funds helpful in this kind of cooperation); and (3) environment (historical affinity and geographical proximity of neighboring border regions, system support at the regional and local level in neighboring countries) ...|$|R

The aim of this research revolves around value creation in international strategic alliances. This thesis strives to identify the streams of added-value in <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships</b> and at which point of time each form of value is created. The results that have surfaced from this research attest that firms may create value, strategic, learning and financial, from strategic alliances, and that those benefits are captured by organizations. Moreover, this study shows that the distinct drivers of value are firstly originated at different stages of the operation. However, the different components act as enablers to the overall value chain potential of the venture. The final finding is that, to some extent, the value created in an international endeavor is limited to the operation, having restricted impact in the competitive positioning of the firm in its domestic market. There is hope that the conclusions drawn from this research constitute a valuable contribution to existing theory on the topic, as well as to any firm in its internationalization growth strategies...|$|R

A {{critical}} look at <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnerships</b> {{in higher}} education: Beyond symbolic arrangementsThis study investigates international research collaboration among academics through an analysis of journal publication {{with a focus on}} 3 countries in the Asia, China, Japan, and Korea. The discussion on cross-border higher education has mainly focused on teaching activities such as student/faculty mobility or program exchange. However, international cooperation in higher education has many faces, and results in various forms. Knowledge exchange of faculty members, which is measured by co-author publication, is one of the important activities of international higher education cooperation. In particular, the knowledge share of Asian academics is getting increasing, they have expanded more opportunities of joint researches and academic interchanges with other foreign universities. To examine the international research collaboration of Asian academics, the online Science Citation Index Expanded database of the ISI Web of Knowledge is used for analysis. International research collaboration is defined as the share of articles published together with at least one author from another country worldwide. Based on bibliometric analysis, patterns of international co-authorship among China, Japan, Korea academics will be examined over the period 1980 – 2010, with an analysis of how these patterns have changed over time. The results of this study will show international co-authorship patterns including the distribution of internationally collaborative publications, the number of collaborative countries, changes of main partner countries among academics in 3 countries.

40|$|A {{premise of}} the {{capabilities}} perspective in strategy is that firm-specific capabilities allow some firms to be unusually adept at exploiting growth opportunities. Since few firms {{have the capacity to}} internally generate the quantity or variety of strategic resources needed to exploit growth opportunities, the ability to externally acquire complementary resources is critical to the acquisition of competitive advantage. However, the external sourcing of resources exposes the firm’s strategic resources to risks of expropriation. We argue this threat gives capable firms incentive to use internally generated strategic resources to pursue growth opportunities before turning to external sources. A pecking order theory of strategic resource deployment is implied. Data from a 22 -year sample of <b>cross-border</b> investment <b>partnership</b> decisions made by U.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{processes}} of Europeanisation and globalisation {{have resulted in a}} reduction of economic barriers between countries and an increasing pace of connectivity among them. For cross-border urban areas, facing increasing economic challenges and competition from large financial powerhouses such as London and Paris, ensuring cross-border economic integration has become a pivotal strategy. From the 1957 Rome Treaty, to current cohesion funds such as Interreg and legal cooperation mechanisms such as the EGTC, the EU has aimed to assist these areas in their challenges and ensure economic progress. The Greater Copenhagen Area, consisting of the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö and the Eurometropolis, comprising the cities of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai, are two cross-border areas which have profited considerably from EU funding and have established various projects. Although both regions share many geographic and organisational similarities, their economic conditions and strategies differ considerably. While the Greater Copenhagen area has become a relatively developed area and established a decentralised cooperation structure based on Interreg funding, the Eurometropolis is defined by considerable local differences and, through the EGTC programme, has established a <b>cross-border</b> <b>partnership</b> of a legal nature. After several decades of EU regional financial assistance and increasing critical rhetoric towards EU policies, the thesis aimed at examing economic development in the Greater Copenhagen area and the Eurometropolis by focussing on two areas, namely infrastructure and mobility and employment. In the case of the former, the construction of the Oresund Bridge provided an opportunity for local authorities to enhance cooperation among local authorities and introduce new infrastructure projects. Further integration in Danish and Swedish employment markets was identified and aims to further enhance mobility between Copenhagen and Malmö. Development in the Eurometropolis in terms of mobility and employment has been significant, however, large infrastructure projects between the cross-border areas have not been realised, albeit the strong opportunities to do so. Considering the aforementioned developments, it is argued that EU influence has indeed provided for considerate economic development in both areas. Although progress in both infrastructure and mobility and employment has been indicated, the research has established as well challenges to further cross-border integration, some of which being a lack of national authorities to increase cross-border cooperation and their inability to fully advantage EU financial assistance...|$|R

This paper assesses the effect of transnational coproduction of public goods in migrants’ places of origin by studying the 3 x 1 Program for Migrants. The 3 x 1 Program is a national social spending program in which the Mexican local, state and federal government matches HTAs’ collective remittances to improve public services through <b>cross-border</b> public-private <b>partnerships.</b> The statistical analysis across municipalities that do and {{do not participate in}} the 3 x 1 Program shows that coproduction improves citizens’ access to public sanitation, drainage and water, although not electricity. Moreover, a negative and statistically significant interaction term between 3 x 1 Program expenditures and family remittances reveals a substitution effect: in the presence of transnational coproduction, migrant households are less likely to improve public goods using family remittance resources, but in the absence of 3 x 1 Program participation they continue to improve their hometowns with family remittances. This research offers a theoretical mechanism and supporting empirical evidence of an important kind of intermediary institution improving social welfare in migrant places of origin...|$|R

In {{the context of}} further European integration and institutionalisation of cross-border cooperation, functional integration in cross-border areas is developing. By exploiting cross-border territorial capital these coalitions might contribute {{to the concept of}} territorial cohesion stated and upgraded in the European Union’s Treaty of Lisbon. The paper considers the right scale for these emerging supra-regional coalitions and their implications for the European Spatial Development Policy. When elaborating on the right delineation of supra- or transnational regional coalitions and about policy options, ‘territorial knowledge’ on territorial specificities, territorial capital and development potential is urgently needed. In border regions this includes cross-border functional linkages and interdependencies. The paper highlights an enhanced framework condition for cross-border functional integration and gives examples of supra-regional coalitions emerging in Europe, especially along Germany’s borders. It shows the difficulties with cross-border data availability for delineation of supra-regional coalitions in Europe and discusses the implications for European Cohesion Policy.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2012. Major: Educational Policy and Administration. Advisor: David W. Chapman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 145 pages, appendices A-C. In international development {{the strategy of}} <b>cross-border</b> university-to-university <b>partnerships</b> is drawing more attention. Funders such as U. S. Agency for International Development are offering large amounts of financial support {{for the development of}} university partnerships, networks, and consortiums. Despite the money that is going into university partnerships and networks, there is only limited research on whether this strategy is effective. This study was conducted at Makerere University, the oldest university in East Africa. Makerere has been engaged with international partners in scores of partnerships, making it an ideal setting to look for perspective on the process and impact of university partnerships. Interviews were conducted with 38 faculty members and content analysis tied what faculty said back to a four-stage model based on literature on partnership development. The first stage of the model focuses on initiation, particularly leadership and motivation. The second stage looks at negotiation of context, the depth of understanding that partners have of where the partnership is based, including organizational structures and the physical and cultural environment. Trust in implementation is the third stage and the final stage is how faculty members evaluate the success of partnerships at their conclusion. In addition to testing the adequacy of the model, this study sought to identify distinctions between partnerships that were internally funded and those that were externally funded. For the most part, the model proved to be a useful tool to represent the process of partnership. However, there were nuances identified, including the large degree to which faculty are motivated by individual benefits; internal challenges at the university that hinder partnership development and impact; informal faculty mentorship that happens during partnerships; and reinforcement of dependence on external funding. These findings were used to offer revisions to the original partnership development model. In this study, all the partnerships that were described were externally funded; the faculty members who were interviewed provided no examples of successful, internally funded partnerships. Implications that the university participates in only externally funded partnerships may indicate that the partnership strategy does not hold promise for future sustainability...|$|R
