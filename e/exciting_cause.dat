John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the <b>exciting</b> <b>cause,</b> the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E

If these causes, whatever they may be, were to act more uniformly and energetically during a lengthened period (and no reason can be assigned why this should not sometimes occur), the result would probably be not mere slight individual differences, but well-marked, constant modifications.

40|$|Abstract — Iterative Learning Control (ILC) {{in motion}} control systems is often {{hampered}} {{by the fact that}} variations in the desired setpoint trajectory are not accounted for. When the setpoint changes, different dynamics are <b>excited</b> <b>causing</b> the learned signal to be less effective in reducing the tracking error. In this paper, two methods to deal with setpoint variation are discussed. In the first method, the learned feedforward signal is decomposed in different force tables corresponding to particular parts of the setpoint. The second method utilizes the learned data from different setpoints to create a finite impulse response (FIR) mapping between setpoint and feedforward input. The potential of both methods is demonstrated through experiment on a lithographic motion system...|$|R

60|$|Besides {{the affection}} of our bodily organs from without, and the {{sensation}} thereby produced in our minds, many writers admit a third {{link in the}} chain of phenomena, which they call a Perception, and which consists in the recognition of an external object as the <b>exciting</b> <b>cause</b> of the sensation. This perception, they say, is an act of the mind, proceeding from its own spontaneous activity; while in a sensation the mind is passive, being merely acted upon by the outward object. And according to some metaphysicians, it is by an act of the mind, similar to perception, except in not being preceded by any sensation, that the existence of God, the soul, and other hyperphysical objects, is recognized.|$|E

The whole organisation becomes slightly plastic. Although each modification must have its own <b>exciting</b> <b>cause,</b> and though each is subjected to law, yet we can so rarely trace the precise relation between cause and effect, that we are tempted to speak of variations as if they arose spontaneously. We may even call them accidental, but this must be only in the sense in which we say that a fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to accident.|$|E

In the grand times of Marathon and Salamis, down to the disastrous times of the Peloponnesian war and the thirty tyrants, no public man’s hands were clean, with the exception, perhaps, of that Aristides, who was banished because men were tired of hearing him called the Just. The <b>exciting</b> <b>cause</b> of the Peloponnesian war, and the consequent downfall of Athens, was not merely the tyranny she exercised over the states allied to her, it was the sharp practice of the Athenians, in misappropriating the tribute paid by the allies to the decoration of Athens.

6000|$|In {{accordance}} with the facts above given, which prove {{that in many cases}} a close relation exists between variability and the sterility following from changed conditions, we may conclude that the <b>exciting</b> <b>cause</b> often acts at the earliest possible period, namely, on the sexual elements, before impregnation has taken place. That an affection of the female sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as probable from the occurrence of bud- variations; for a bud seems to be the analogue of an ovule. But the male element is apparently much oftener affected by changed conditions, at least in a visible manner, than the female element or ovule and we know from Gartner's and Wichura's statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with a pure species gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring, than does the same hybrid when used as the mother. Lastly, it is certain that variability may be transmitted through either sexual element, whether or not originally excited in them, for Kolreuter and Gartner (22/53. 'Dritte Fortsetzung' etc. s. 123; 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 249.) found that when two species were crossed, if either one was variable, the offspring were rendered variable.] ...|$|E

Partly lest she might hear bad news--this was her secret fear; partly lest she might bring some attention to herself in connection with his going.
