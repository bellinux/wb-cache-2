Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran off the track at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had a gearbox problem {{at the start of the}} race and was unable to select <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in dry and warm weather conditions. Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 38.474 seconds, ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard. Barrichello set the fourth quickest time and caused the session to be yellow flagged when he lost control of his car and spun at the hairpin between turns ten and eleven and crashed into the perimeter fencing. Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella. Frentzen and Jarno Trulli set the seventh and ninth fastest times respectively for Jordan; they were separated by Jaguar's Eddie Irvine. Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR completed the top ten despite spinning off the circuit which caused grass to penetrate his radiators. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:37.728, six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello had trouble selecting <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> on his final run although he set the third quickest time. Coulthard was fourth fastest, ahead of Button. Frentzen and Trulli continued their good form setting the sixth and seventh fastest times. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta completed the top ten fastest drivers. During the session, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale was felt at Suzuka, although no structural damage was reported around the circuit despite mild alarm.|$|E

25|$|Land Rover {{revealed}} the Evoque with nine-speed automatic transmission during the Geneva Motor Show. This new automatic transmission is developed by ZF Friedrichshafen and offers better acceleration, efficiency and improved comfort. In addition, the nine-speed automatic transmission's <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> is specially designed for off road conditions, towing and adverse on road conditions. And also, <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> of a nine-speed automatic transmission {{is much lower}} than the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> of a six-speed automatic. However, Land Rover did not reveal any further technical details about the new automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} all these {{features}} is that under normal circumstances (driving straight on dry or even wet road surfaces) the car never loses traction, even when accelerating at full throttle in the <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> is immediately de-selected, and third gear (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second clutch disengages and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues {{in the same manner}} for the remaining forward gears.|$|E
50|$|To allow weight reduction, the triple-shafted {{gear train}} {{is made with}} reverse and <b>first</b> <b>gears</b> on the same shaft, {{and the use of}} a shorter {{secondary}} shaft.|$|R

It was used in the first pressurised aircraft, the Junkers Ju 49 and, for a while, in the large G 38 airliner and its Japanese built military version.|$|R
25|$|As {{of about}} lap 30, Allison was {{holding on to}} a 20-point lead in the standings over Elliott and Kulwicki. By lap 60, Elliott had worked up to 5th place, the highest running of the {{championship}} contenders. During the first sequence of pit stops a yellow came out, and trapped several cars (including leader Dale Earnhardt) a lap down. Alan Kulwicki's car had trouble pulling from the pit area, and lost <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b> Bill Elliott was the first driver off of pit road, and took over the lead. The pit stop shuffle saw Kulwicki up to second, with Mark Martin in 4th, and Harry Gant up to 5th.|$|E
25|$|Several {{versions}} of the Bristol LH were used by London Transport. 17 narrow LHSs with five-speed gearboxes were delivered to in 1975 to replace Ford Transit minibuses on narrow roads. Although fitted with five-speed gearboxes the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> was blocked off to make driving easier in traffic. In 1976 95 full length vehicles with automatic transmissions and narrow bodies were purchased. The 7ft 6in bodies were {{not only because of}} narrow roads on some routes, but also due to the restricted space at Kingston garage in Surrey which prevented the Leyland National being deployed there. LHSs were classified by London Transport as BS; full length LHs were classiifed BL.|$|E
25|$|Elliott pitted on lap 314. He had {{a quicker}} pit stop since {{he still had}} use of <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b> He came out ahead of Kulwicki on the track. Terry Labonte led lap 315, then he pitted. Elliott re-assumed the lead on lap 316, and led the final 13 laps. Elliott's laps led total came to 102 – one lap fewer than Kulwicki's 103. With Elliott leading, Kulwicki tucked into a {{comfortable}} second, conserved fuel, and did not mount a challenge for the lead. Kulwicki and his crew had already figured out that if Elliott led {{the rest of the}} way, Kulwicki would still clinch the five bonus points. Furthermore, Kulwicki had a comfortable lead over third place, and was not being challenged.|$|E

25|$|Bottas {{entered the}} pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo doing {{likewise}} {{on the next}} lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and emerged back in first, narrowly ahead of Button. Rosberg was informed over the radio {{that he could not}} go beyond 6,500 revolutions per minute in <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> because his pit lane limiter was faulty. He drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched his car off and Rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel in an attempt to change gear. After being stationary for nearly two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed back into his garage and retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap, and Vergne was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the next lap after being judged to have exceeded track limits. Gutiérrez drove into his garage to retire with an engine electrical problem on lap 19. Chilton was forced into making an unscheduled pit stop two laps later after his front-right tyre was punctured because of a valve problem on the wheel.|$|E
25|$|Aware of the {{possible}} implications, Rosenqvist pulled away to build a steady advantage over Buemi. Evans's team forgot to change the gear in his second car, delaying his exit from his garage as he required additional time to get his vehicle into <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b> This caused Evans to emerge {{at the back of}} the field in 18th position. As the field became comfortable in the second period of the event, di Grassi began to challenge Vergne for third position. Following aggressive defensive manoeuvres which drew a verbal warning from his team, Vergne narrowly avoided hitting di Grassi at the final turn. Vergne was forced off the racing line under braking by di Grassi who overtook him for third heading into the first corner on lap 32. Abt activated FanBoost in an attempt to move ahead of Vergne on the next lap but was unable to pass him. Contact prevented Abt from overtaking Vergne, but after a short period of time, passed him for fourth place. Duval stopped on the circuit but later managed to limp his ailing car into the pit lane, prematurely ending his race. Having reviewed Rosenqvist's pit stop release, the stewards issued him with a ten-second time penalty on lap 34.|$|E
25|$|The safety car was {{deployed}} to allow marshals to remove Pérez's {{car from the}} track and into the run-off area. Grosjean's tyre was punctured from contact by Sutil and both drivers made pit stops. Swift work from the marshals allowed the safety car to be withdrawn {{at the end of}} the third lap and Rosberg led the field back up to speed. Vettel slowed with a mechanical problem which caused his turbocharger to stop working and was overtaken by the rest of the field in quick succession. He made a pit stop and came out among the leaders and complained he was stuck in <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b> Both Mercedes drivers pulled away from the rest of the field, and Hamilton went two-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg, to be 0.6 seconds behind his teammate. Vettel's turbocharger restarted on lap six but was instructed by his team to retire from the event on the following lap. It was announced that the stewards were investigating the first lap incident between Pérez and Button. On lap nine, Sutil went up the inside of Grosjean, mounted his car on the hairpin kerbs, and passed him for 17th. Kvyat's car developed an exhaust issue and managed to limp his ailing Toro Rosso back to the pit lane to retire on lap 11.|$|E

500|$|Most criticised was the {{behavior}} at low revs, the engine sound was described with words like [...] "a pail of {{nuts and bolts}} being poured through a Magimix", rattling clutch, grinding transmission, crackling chassis, rumbling and groaning body contributing to the impression of imminent breakdown.

500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E
