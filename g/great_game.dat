5|$|George MacDonald Fraser's The Flashman Papers novels feature Cardigan as a {{recurring}} villain. In the first instalment, he commands Flashman in the 11th Hussars and transfers him to India after he marries Elspeth {{on the grounds}} that she is the daughter of a tradesman. Cardigan reappears in Flashman at the Charge, where Flashman catches Cardigan trying to seduce Elspeth. Flashman later reluctantly joins Cardigan for the Charge of the Light Brigade. He appears briefly in Flashman in the <b>Great</b> <b>Game,</b> where Cardigan demands Flashman defend Cardigan's reputation against hostile journalists. Flashman not only refuses but pointedly insults Cardigan. His last mention comes in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord, where Flashman observes Cardigan's liaison with Fanny Paget.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Chelsea {{featured}} {{in one of}} the earliest football films, The <b>Great</b> <b>Game.</b> One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington. Owing to the notoriety of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also {{featured in}} films about football hooliganism, including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od juče made an episode in which Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nikšić for qualification of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a <b>great</b> <b>game,</b> and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of petroleum in 1908 by the British in Khuzestan spawned intense {{renewed interest in}} Persia by the British Empire (see William Knox D'Arcy and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP).

25|$|In {{the last}} seconds of a nationally {{televised}} regular season game with the Portland Trail Blazers in March 1992, Bird sent the game into overtime with an off balance running one-handed three-point shot. Bird tallied 49 points, 14 rebounds, 12 assists and 4 steals for his 59th and final career triple-double in what many fans called his last <b>great</b> <b>game</b> in the NBA.

25|$|Many {{references}} to the event were made in later novels and films. Julian Rathbone describes the brutality of both British and Indian forces during the siege of Cawnpore in his novel The Mutiny. In the novel, the Indian nurse Lavanya rescues an English child, Stephen, during the Satichaura Ghat massacre. In Massacre at Cawnpore, V. A. Stuart describes the siege and the British defence {{through the eyes of}} the characters Sheridan, and his wife Emmy. George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman in the <b>Great</b> <b>Game</b> also contains lengthy scenes set in the entrenchment during the siege and also during the ensuing escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{forces of}} the khanates were poorly {{equipped}} and could do little to resist Russia's advances, although the Kokandian commander Alimqul led a quixotic campaign before being killed outside Chimkent. The main opposition to Russian expansion into Turkestan came from the British, who felt that Russia was growing too powerful and threatening the northwest frontiers of British India. This rivalry {{came to be known}} as The <b>Great</b> <b>Game,</b> where both powers competed to advance their own interests in the region. It did little to slow the pace of conquest north of the Oxus, but did ensure that Afghanistan remained independent as a buffer state between the two Empires.|$|E

25|$|The {{root cause}} of the Third Anglo-Afghan War lies many years before the actual {{fighting}} commenced. For the British in India, Afghanistan was long seen as a potential source of threat. For a long time the British worried about Russian intentions in the region, concerned that a possible invasion of India could be launched by Tsarist forces through Afghanistan. This period {{became known as the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Game.</b> In an effort to negate this threat, the British made numerous attempts at imposing their will upon Kabul, and {{over the course of the}} 19th Century fought two wars: the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42) and the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80).|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} ethnic group in Afghanistan, Pashtuns {{have been the}} {{dominant}} ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years. During the Delhi Sultanate era, the 15th–16th century Lodi dynasty briefly replaced the preexisting rulers in North India until Babur completely deposed the Lodi dynasty. Other Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century, which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the <b>Great</b> <b>Game</b> from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires.|$|E
25|$|Yakub Beg ruled at {{the height}} of The <b>Great</b> <b>Game</b> era when the British, Russian, and Manchu Qing empires were all vying for Central Asia. Kashgaria {{extended}} from the capital Kashgar in south-western Xinjiang to Ürümqi, Turfan, and Hami in central and eastern Xinjiang more than a thousand kilometers to the north-east, including a majority of what was known at the time as East Turkestan. Kashgar and the other cities of the Tarim basin remained under Yakub Beg's rule until December 1877. Yakub Beg's rule lasted until General Zuo Zongtang (also known as General Tso) reconquered the region in 1877 for Qing China. In 1881, Qing China recovered the Gulja region through diplomatic negotiations (Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)).|$|E
