40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} {{the type and}} patterning of morphogenic cell behaviors driving convergent extension of the Xenopus neural plate in the presence and absence of persistent vertical signals from the mesoderm by videorecording explants of deep neural tissue with involuted mesoderm attached and of deep neural tissue alone. <b>In</b> <b>deep</b> neural-over-mesoderm explants, neural plate cells express monopolar medially directed motility and notoplate cells express randomly oriented motility, two new morphogenic cell behaviors. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> neural explants (without notoplate), all cells express bipolar mediolateral cell motility. Deep neural-over-mesoderm and deep neural explants also differ in degree of neighbor exchange during mediolateral cell intercalation. <b>In</b> <b>deep</b> neural-over-mesoderm explants, cells intercalate conservatively, whereas <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> neural explants cells intercalate more promiscuously. Last, <b>in</b> both <b>deep</b> neural-over-mesoderm and deep neural explants, morphogenic cell behaviors differentiate in an anterior-to-posterior and lateral-to-medial progression. However, <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> neural-over-mesoderm explants, morphogenic behaviors first differentiate in intervals along the anteroposterior axis, whereas <b>in</b> <b>deep</b> neural explants, morphogenic behaviors differentiate continuously from the anterior end of the tissue posteriorly. These results describe new morphogenic cell behaviors driving neural convergent extension and also define roles for signals from the mesoderm, up to and beyond late gastrulation, in patterning these cell behaviors...|$|R
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups.

In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} shallow and parfrying in soybean oil as {{alternatives}} to deep frying {{and evaluation of}} stability of a formulated antioxidant administered to the oil was conducted. Potato wedges were deep, shallow and parfried in soybean oil for optimized time and temperature. A citric acid based antioxidant using BHT was formulated and administered to the oils before frying.

5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and weighing up to 5 pounds.

5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a {{significant}} force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron. Reaching the Sunda Strait on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of Bantam and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, {{and the rest of the}} Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron. By the time their mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove Phoenix ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

5|$|Nocturnally active, {{the prickly}} shark rests {{during the day}} <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} are found <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, {{particularly if they}} are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E

5|$|Though the Admiralty {{arranged}} {{for some of}} the ships to be salvaged, most were left {{at the bottom of the}} sound until entrepreneur Ernest Cox bought the salvage rights and began to raise the remaining ships in the early 1920s. Bremse presented particular challenges. She had come to rest perched precariously on a rock, which sloped away dramatically, causing fears that she might slip off and sink <b>in</b> <b>deeper</b> water. Cox's salvage team sealed her bulkheads and divided the hull into watertight compartments. The hull was patched up and an airlock fitted, but the team ran into difficulties with the large amount of oil which covered the wreck, more than had been found in any other of the ships salvaged previously. A three-man team using oxyacetylene torches ignited some oil, causing an explosion. The men escaped without serious injuries, and thereafter small explosions and fires were common over the two months it took to prepare the ship, though no one was injured.|$|E
