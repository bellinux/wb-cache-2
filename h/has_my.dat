500|$|The {{installment}} {{has been}} very positively received by the show's cast and crew. Series creator Steve Franks was asked by iTunes in 2009 to select his twelve favorite episodes {{to be put on}} a special DVD release. The collection, titled Psych: Twelve Episodes That Will Make You Happy, contained four episodes from the first season, including [...] "Spellingg Bee". When describing the episode, Franks stated that [...] "The Spellingg Bee <b>has</b> <b>my</b> one of my favorite scenes in the run of the show when Shawn takes over for the spellmaster and has to investigate a murder while making up words for the contestants to spell". In 2013, iTunes asked stars James Roday and Dulé Hill to select their 20 favorite episodes from the show. The DVD collection was titled Psych: James and Dule's Top 20, with [...] "Spellingg Bee" [...] was selected as #14 on the collection, picked by Roday. Three other episodes from the first season were also selected.|$|E
500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also <b>has</b> <b>my</b> same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Billboard magazine, Beyoncé described I Am... Sasha Fierce as a double album. She said, [...] "One side has songs that are more mainstream and another <b>has</b> <b>my</b> more traditional R songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s." [...] Music writer Andy Kellman of AllMusic viewed its first disc as, [...] "essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '70s soft rock than soul." [...] The second disc, Sasha Fierce, contains consistent electro influences, which are displayed in songs like [...] "Radio" [...] and [...] "Sweet Dreams". Kellman said in his review that [...] "Diva" [...] resembles B'Days [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] or [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] in terms of audacity. Despite being on the Sasha Fierce disc, [...] "Ego", [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] and [...] "Scared of Lonely" [...] were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble Sasha Fierce musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the I Am... disc. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her hit single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In {{an interview}} with Emmet Sullivan of People magazine, Beyoncé affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego.|$|E
500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance <b>has</b> <b>my</b> recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, {{including}} four chart toppers. [...] Hits include [...] "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", [...] "To Make Love Sweeter For You", [...] "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", [...] "Since I Met You Baby", [...] "Once More With Feeling", [...] "One <b>Has</b> <b>My</b> Name (The Other <b>Has</b> <b>My</b> Heart)", and [...] "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye, was sparse, {{quite different from}} the slick [...] "Nashville sound" [...] that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. [...] The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. [...] In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording [...] "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".|$|E
