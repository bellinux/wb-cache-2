This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find {{a different sort of}} gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

500|$|Both of Benn's grandfathers were Liberal Party MPs; his {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} John Benn, a successful politician, MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport, who was created a baronet in 1914 (and who founded a publishing company, Benn Brothers), and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes, MP for Glasgow Govan. Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit. I've looked at Labour leaders in a <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> ever since." [...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E

500|$|The idea of Ann {{making out}} with Chris Traeger {{was not part}} of the {{original}} screenplay, but was added after the first cast read-through of the script. The writing staff felt that while Ben was immediately connected to Leslie and the other characters through his role in eliminating wasteful spending at Pawnee, Chris still needed something to more strongly connect to the cast, and the subplot with Ann was determined to be a <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> to do it. In one scene, after Ben explains the need for severe budget cuts at Pawnee, Ron asks Leslie, [...] "What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?" [...] That line was not in the first draft of the script, but was added during filming as a possible alternative line for the editors to choose from later. The staff found it so funny, however, that they chose to use it and the original line was never filmed.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, Hart had sunk into {{alcoholism}} and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and [...] prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein {{to ask if}} he would consider working with him. [...] Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was Oklahoma! (1943). [...] Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is [...] "the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. [...] In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it." [...] An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as [...] "the model for Broadway shows for decades", and proved a huge popular and financial success. [...] Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. [...] Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers [...] "was Sam's blunt but <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma!" [...] As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, [...] "We're such fools. [...] No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another Oklahoma! [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{documentary}} called The Butch Factor, {{a number of}} gay men—one of them transgender—were asked about their views on masculinity. The consensus was that showing masculine traits was an advantage, {{both in and out}} the closet. For the [...] "butch" [...] gay men, this allowed them to conceal their sexual orientation for longer when doing masculine activities such as playing sports, as effeminacy is often incorrectly associated with homosexuality— so much so that they doubted their own sexual orientation; because they did not see themselves as effeminate, they did not feel they were gay. Because of this, they did not feel as much of a connection with gay culture. Men who had a more feminine appearance were the first {{to come out of the}} closet; they were the first to be labelled gay by their peers. They were more likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives; many gay men have been taunted using derogatory words that imply feminine qualities, for example, sissy. Effeminate or camp-acting gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew describes as [...] "camp humour", such as referring to one another using female pronouns as [...] "a <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> of defusing hate directed toward [...] ".
