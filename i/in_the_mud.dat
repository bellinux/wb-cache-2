5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Worlds End State Park, as the area was once a river delta on an ancient coastline. This coast was home to an ancient {{ancestor}} of the lungfish, which would burrow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to survive dry spells. Fossils of these burrows have been discovered in the red siltstone formations in and near the park.|$|E
5|$|The major {{communities}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mud</b> Creek watershed are Jerseytown and Washingtonville. Major {{roads in}} the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 254. There are also a number of township roads that go to the creek and its tributaries.|$|E

25|$|The {{occurrence}} of chemosymbiotic biota <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extensive <b>mud</b> volcano {{fields of the}} Gulf of Cádiz was first reported <b>in</b> 2003. <b>The</b> chemosymbiotic bivalves collected from <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> volcanoes of <b>the</b> Gulf of Cadiz were reviewed in 2011.|$|R
5|$|As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, {{making it}} of {{international}} importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese {{and a few}} tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> flats.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, The Christian Science Monitor {{reported}} that Pan Gulf had become stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> off Governors Island after her crew misjudged {{how far to}} back out of her berth at the Army base there. The first, unsuccessful attempt to free Pan Gulf from her predicament involved eight tugs, but the ship did not budge. The newspaper, which had also {{reported that}} there was no apparent damage to Pan Gulf in the grounding, carried no further reports on the ship.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E

50|$|Native Mi'kmaq {{legend has}} it that the Five Islands were created when their god Glooscap threw <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> sticks and stones at the giant beaver who dammed his {{medicine}} garden <b>in</b> Advocate. <b>The</b> <b>mud,</b> sticks and stones that formed the islands are said to have trapped <b>the</b> beaver <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> islands and turned it into gold.|$|R
5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp {{rode with}} the sheriff's posse {{attempting}} {{to track the}} stage robbers. Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> The posse checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel {{that he had just}} removed from Stilwell's boot. A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> {{but these are not}} available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E

40|$|Mud volcanoes are {{emissions}} of cold <b>mud</b> due to <b>the</b> ascent {{to the surface}} of salty and muddy waters mixed with gaseous (methane) and, in minor part, fluid hydrocarbons (petroleum veils) along faults and fractures. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Emilia-Romagna Apennines (Northern Italy) mud volcanoes are closely linked to the active tectonic compression associated with a thrust of regional importance. They are mostly cone-shaped and show variable geometry and size, ranging from one to few metres, and are located in 19 sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern part of <b>the</b> Apennines. <b>The</b> <b>mud</b> volcanoes of <b>the</b> region have been known since a long time and have always aroused great interest due to their outstanding scenic value. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> volcano emissions have been used <b>in</b> many ways: <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> was applied for cosmetic use and the natural oil was much appreciated for its balsamic and purgative properties. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last decades <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> volcanoes have represented a relevant tourist attractiveness...|$|R
5|$|Forensic {{anthropologist}} Clyde Snow {{learned of}} the massacre {{during his visit to}} Zagreb in October 1992. Snow travelled there as a United Nations (UN) team member sent to investigate reports of war crimes. In a meeting Snow had with the dean of the Zagreb University School of Medicine, he was introduced to a former soldier who claimed to have survived the massacre and told Snow where it took place. Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, a {{town that}} at that time had a {{population}} of approximately85,000, 20,000were left homeless (nearly {{one third of the}} towns population), and an additional 4,000were injured. It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city with mud filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|In the book's opening, {{the title}} {{character}} and her mate ambush a herd of Astrodon, which are large herbivorous sauropods. The Astrodon are surprised, thinking that their bulk deters smaller predators. Utahraptor, however, are much larger than any resident raptor, and proceed to take down an Astrodon with teamwork. When Red's mate climbs onto the dead Astrodon, the corpse rolls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> trapping the male under {{the bulk of the}} animal. Despite Red's best efforts, her mate suffocates. Despondent, Red wanders around the floodplain, nearly starving since a Utahraptor cannot successfully hunt big game on its own.|$|E

5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was {{to make contact with}} the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million {{can be attributed to}} the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Battalion {{disengaged}} {{from the}} North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00, September 6. The battalion abandoned {{two of its}} own tanks, one because of mechanical failure and the other because it was stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> The battalion moved to the rear in two main groups: G Company to attack Hill 464 {{and the rest of}} the battalion to seize Hill 380, farther south. The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. The battalion commander, Major Omar T. Hitchner, and his operations officer, Captain James T. Milam, were killed. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Nist thought that the entire battalion was lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately doomed to failure, with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
