40|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ) refused {{jurisdiction}} in Georgia’s suit against Russia under the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, {{finding that the}} treaty’s jurisdictional clause, which limits jurisdiction to unsettled disputes, did not apply {{in the absence of}} good-faith negotiation. The court reversed its provisional measures order, which <b>entertained</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and continued a line of cases holding that clauses like the treaty’s jurisdictional clause serve mainly to give the parties notice of the dispute. The ICJ’s ruling noted that these clauses also reflect limits on parties’ consent to jurisdiction and a general preference for negotiated solutions. This suggests that the court will scrutinize attempted diplomacy more in the future to ensure good-faith conduct. Yet the court refused to overturn precedents permitting use of open forums such as the UN and finding negotiations where the specific treaty obligations are not identified, making good faith harder to ensure. The ICJ’s adherence to a more flexible standard thus still provides a way for complainants to satisfy jurisdictional thresholds without fully engaging respondents beforehand...|$|R

To please everyone, Josh shows off his super intense dancing moves, and he is {{suggested}} to join the Channel 7 dance contest on TV; Josh agrees to enter the dance contest to not only show off his dance skills, but to finally best his rival and on-and-off girlfriend Mindy into being #1. While Drake is playing with a hula hoop, his gym teacher visits their house and notifies Audrey that Drake is failing gym (due to being tardy and not dressing out when needed to),probabily due his lack of education {{and will have to}} repeat his junior year as a result; Drake doesn't want this to happen and decides to enter the Channel 7 dance contest as well to receive extra credit. At the Premiere, Josh talks to Emily Henderson (Johanna Braddy), who will be his dance partner and is the best dancer in San Diego, about the dance contest; Drake shows up and starts to talk to Emily himself while Josh is forced by his boss Helen to take care of some gangsters in a movie theater (despite it being Josh's day-off). When Josh finds out that Drake stole his dance partner Emily (because Drake gave Emily Josh's digital camera), he partners up with the best dancer in Eastern Europe named Vilga, who insults Drake and Emily. Unfortunately, Emily and Vilga doesn't get along and end up fighting, but Drake and Josh break it up. At the Channel 7 Dance Studio, Emily and Vilga once again get in a fight and are disqualified from the competition as a result. Drake and Josh are upset and starts to forfeit, until an idea comes to mind. Drake and Josh become dance partners and they put on an amazing and shocking show in front of the audience and <b>judges,</b> <b>entertaining</b> them all. After they finish, Drake and Josh are announced as the winners of the Channel 7 Dance Contest. At home, Audrey and Megan are shocked at Drake and Josh's dancing skills.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{the truth}} of the first of these propositions no {{competent}} <b>judge</b> now <b>entertains</b> any doubt. The second is more open to discussion, for in these latter days many question the special creation of man: and even if his special creation be granted, there is not a shadow of a reason why he should have been created in Asia rather than anywhere else. Of all the odd myths that have arisen in the scientific world, the [...] "Caucasian mystery," [...] invented quite innocently by Blumenbach, is the oddest. A Georgian woman's skull was the handsomest in his collection. Hence it became his model exemplar of human skulls, from which all others might be regarded as deviations; and out of this, by some strange intellectual hocus-pocus, grew up the notion that the Caucasian man is the prototypic [...] "Adamic" [...] man, and his country the primitive centre of our kind. Perhaps the most curious thing of all is, that the said Georgian skull, after all, is not a skull of average form, but distinctly belongs to the brachycephalic group.|$|R
40|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{have recently}} appealed to predication in developing their theories of cognitive representation and propositions. One central point {{of difference between}} them is whether they take predication to be forceful or neutral and whether they take the most basic cognitive representational act to be <b>judging</b> or <b>entertaining.</b> Both views are supported by powerful reasons and both face problems. Many think that predication must be forceful {{if it is to}} explain representation. However, the standard ways of implementing the idea give rise to the Frege-Geach problem. Others think that predication must be neutral, if we’re to avoid the Frege-Geach problem. However, it looks like nothing neutral can explain representation. In this paper I present a third view, one which respects the powerful reasons while avoiding the problems. On this view predication is forceful and can thus explain representation, but the idea is implemented in a novel way, avoiding the Frege-Geach problem. The key is {{to make sense of the}} notion of grasping a proposition as an objectual act where the object is a proposition...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} of contract law {{began in the}} Church courts, following Roman law. These courts claimed (with some validity) to enforce all promises made by oath, or by [...] "pledge of faith". The man who pledges his faith, or on his soul, arguably has pawned his soul, and in so doing, has left his salvation to actions of another. Henry II of England asserted his jurisdiction over such cases. Thomas Becket claimed concurrent jurisdiction for the Church. Henry won. From that time onward, the royal court was always at the ready to prohibit ecclesiastical <b>judges</b> from <b>entertaining</b> a breach of faith, unless both parties were clerks (church clerics) or the matter lay {{outside the realm of}} the temporal. The method was to issue a writ of prohibition, prohibiting the church court from hearing and ruling on the case. The practice developed whereby a contractor would seek relief in a church court and renounce all right to a writ of prohibition. Sometimes the litigant would not receive the decision he wanted in the ecclesiastic court, and then would renounce his pledge, and seek a writ of prohibition from the common law court. Bracton explained that it was a terrible sin to seek a writ of prohibition when one had promised not to seek one. This was a crime that deserved imprisonment. Jurisdiction over such matters, as well as marriages and wills remained contentious in Bracton's day.|$|R
6000|$|There {{is another}} {{interesting}} fact {{with respect to}} the characters of the several breeds, namely, that they are often most strongly displayed in the male bird. In Carriers, when the males and females are exhibited in separate pens, the wattle is plainly seen to be much more developed in the males, though I have seen a hen Carrier belonging to Mr. Haynes heavily wattled. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that, in twenty Barbs in Mr. P.H. Jones's possession, the males had generally the largest eye-wattles; Mr. Esquilant also believes in this rule, but Mr. H. Weir, a first-rate <b>judge,</b> <b>entertains</b> some doubt on the subject. Male Pouters distend their crops to a much greater size than do the females; I have, however, seen a hen in the possession of Mr. Evans which pouted excellently; but this is an unusual circumstance. Mr. Harrison Weir, a successful breeder of prize Fantails, informs me that his male birds often have a greater number of tail-feathers than the females. Mr. Eaton asserts (5/32. 'A Treatise, etc.' page 10.) that if a cock and hen Tumbler were of equal merit, the hen would be worth double the money; and as pigeons always pair, so that an equal number of both sexes is necessary for reproduction, this seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female than in the male. In the development of the frill in Turbits, of the hood in Jacobins, of the tuft in Trumpeters, of tumbling in Tumblers, there is no difference between the males and females. I may here add a rather different case, namely, the existence in France (5/33. Boitard and Corbie 'Les Pigeons' etc. 1824 page 173.) of a wine- coloured variety of the Pouter, in which the male is generally chequered with black, whilst the female is never so chequered. Dr. Chapuis also remarks (5/34. 'Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge' 1865 page 87. I have given in my 'Descent of Man' 6th edition page 466 some curious cases, on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier, of silver-coloured (i.e. very pale blue) birds being generally females, and of the ease with which a race thus characterised could be produced. Bonizzi (see 'Variazioni dei Columbi domestici' Padova 1873) states that certain coloured spots are often different in the two sexes, and the certain tints are commoner in females than in male pigeons.) that in certain light-coloured pigeons the males have their feathers striated with black, and these striae increase in size at each moult, so that the male ultimately becomes spotted with black. With Carriers, the wattle, both on the beak and round the eyes, and with Barbs that round the eyes, goes on increasing with age. This augmentation of character with advancing age, and more especially the difference between the males and females in the above-mentioned several respects, are remarkable facts, for there is no sensible difference at any age between the two sexes in the aboriginal rock-pigeon; and not often any strongly marked difference throughout the family of the Columbidae. (5/35. Prof. A. Newton 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1865 page 716 remarks that he knows no species which present any remarkable sexual distinction; but Mr. Wallace informs me, that in the sub-family of the Treronidae the sexes often differ considerably in colour. See also on sexual differences in the Columbidae, Gould 'Handbook to the Birds of Australia' volume 2 pages 109-149.) ...|$|R

50|$|Mary {{was fully}} {{involved}} in {{the consequences of the}} war itself and the efforts to secure her husband’s return. On the morning of July 7, 1779, for instance, a British fleet arrived to mount a full-scale attack on Fairfield. Mary was prepared for the emergency, calmly evacuating her household to North Stratford. Throughout her husband’s captivity, she wrote letters to well-connected men, like Connecticut’s Governor Trumbull, in order to appeal for their help in securing an exchange for Gold. Because the Patriots had no acceptable prisoner to exchange for Gold, some of his friends decided to take one. They chose Tory leader and Chief Justice Judge Thomas Jones of Long Island. On November 6 with the consent of the Governor, Captain David Hawley of Stratford and Captain Samuel Lockwood of Norwalk captured both the Judge and a young man named Willett, whom they hoped to exchange for Billy. Mary <b>entertained</b> <b>Judge</b> Jones as a guest in her home for several days. On April 27, 1780, a boat which Mary had hired departed Black Rock Harbor with Judge Jones aboard to return him and bring Silliman back. By coincidence that very same day, Silliman’s New York captors had chosen to send him home, so both prisoners returned safely home.|$|R
60|$|Not that I would {{encourage}} popular disorder, or any disorder. But I would leave such offences to the law, {{to be punished}} in measure and proportion.

60|$|I {{am aware}} {{that in some}} of the speeches Judge Douglas has made, he has spoken as if he did not know or think that the Supreme Court had decided that a Territorial Legislature cannot exclude slavery. Precisely what the Judge would say upon the subject--whether he would say {{definitely}} that he does not understand they have so decided, or whether he would say he does understand that the court have so decided,--I do not know; but I know that in his speech at Springfield he spoke of it as a thing they had not decided yet; and in his answer to me at Freeport, he spoke of it, so far, again, as I can comprehend it, as a thing that had not yet been decided. Now, I hold that if the <b>Judge</b> does <b>entertain</b> that view, I think that he is not mistaken in so far as {{it can be said that}} the court has not decided anything save the mere question of jurisdiction. I know the legal arguments that can be made,--that after a court has decided that it cannot take jurisdiction in a case, it then has decided all that is before it, and that is the end of it. A plausible argument can be made in favor of that proposition; but I know that Judge Douglas has said in one of his speeches that the court went forward, like honest men as they were, and decided all the points in the case. If any points are really extra-judicially decided, because not necessarily before them, then this one as to the power of the Territorial Legislature, to exclude slavery is one of them, as also the one that the Missouri Compromise was null and void. They are both extra-judicial, or neither is, according as the court held that they had no jurisdiction in the case between the parties, because of want of capacity of one party to maintain a suit in that court. I want, if I have sufficient time, to show that the court did pass its opinion; but that is the only thing actually done in the case. If they did not decide, they showed what they were ready to decide whenever the matter was before them. What is that opinion? After having argued that Congress had no power to pass a law excluding slavery from a United States Territory, they then used language to this effect: That inasmuch as Congress itself could not exercise such a power, it followed as a matter of course that it could not authorize a Territorial government to exercise it; for the Territorial Legislature can do no more than Congress could do. Thus it expressed its opinion emphatically against the power of a Territorial Legislature to exclude slavery, leaving us in just as little doubt on that point as upon any other point they really decided.|$|R
40|$|Multidistrict {{litigation}} {{has frequently}} {{been described as}} a “black hole” because transfer is typically a one-way ticket. The numbers lend truth to this proposition. As of 2010, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation remanded only 3. 425 % of cases to their original districts. That number dwindled to 3. 1 % in 2012, and to a scant 2. 9 % in 2013. Retaining cases in hopes of forcing a global settlement can cause a constellation of complications. These concerns range from procedural justice issues over selecting a forum and correcting error, to substantive concerns about fidelity to state laws, to undermining democratic participation ideals fulfilled through jury trials in affected communities. Yet, if transferee judges remanded cases after overseeing discovery into common issues, they could alleviate those concerns while avoiding inconsistent rulings on common questions and streamlining discovery. Despite the potential upside, remand rarely occurs because it disfavors those with litigation control — transferee judges, lead plaintiffs’ attorneys, and defendants. Transferee judges deem settlement a hallmark of their success. Lead plaintiffs’ lawyers try to increase their fees by inserting fee provisions into settlements. Likewise, plaintiffs’ attorneys can bypass doctrinal uncertainties over weak claims by packaging plaintiffs together in a global settlement. And aggregate settlements allow defendants to resolve as many claims as possible in one stroke, take their hit, and return to business, which their shareholders view as a net positive. The remand process itself defers to these vested interests. Although the Panel could remand cases at a party’s request, in practice it appears never to have done so. Rather, it waits for the transferee judge to admit defeat and suggest remand — thereby conceding failure. For transferee judges to begin remanding cases, the “pro-settlement” norm and “remand-as-a-failure” stigma must change. Accordingly, transferee <b>judges</b> should routinely <b>entertain</b> a suggestion for remand by a party or initiate them sua sponte as soon as discovery on common issues concludes and only case-specific issues remain. Likewise, the Panel should seriously consider parties’ remand requests even when the transferee judge does not support them. This reopens a direct line for parties to request remand when common discovery ends, but the transferee judge prefers to hold cases hostage in hopes of coercing settlement...|$|R

Never did an envenomed scurrility against everything sacred and civil, public and private, rage through the kingdom with such a furious and unbridled licence.
