40|$|Background: The Care of cleft {{patients}} is very challenging. Team cleft care is usually lacking {{in many developing}} countries due to shortage of qualified manpower. This study is aimed at highlighting anaesthetic challenges in the management of cleft in children. Patients and Methods: This was a study of cleft lip and palate patients who were managed during team cleft care activities at University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and Federal Medical Centre Nguru both in north eastern Nigeria from January to June 2009. Results: One hundred and six cleft patients presented for surgical repair under general or local anaesthesia. Fifteen (14 &#x 0025;) patients all of whom children were unfit for general anaesthesia due to various medical reasons. Ninety-one (86 &#x 0025;) cleft patients comprising 53 (50 &#x 0025;) children and 38 (36 &#x 0025;) adults had cleft repair under halothane general <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and local anaesthesia, respectively. There was no anaesthetic complications recorded under local anaesthesia. Fifteen percent of children who received general <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> suffered various anaesthetic complications which included hypoxia (3. 8 &#x 0025;), laryngospasm (1. 9 &#x 0025;), kinking of endotracheal tube (5. 7 &#x 0025;), inadvertent extubation (1. 9 &#x 0025;) and pulmonary aspiration (1. 9 &#x 0025;). There was no mortality or anaesthesia-related morbidity at the time of discharge in all the cases. Conclusion: We conclude that anaesthesia for cleft lip and palate repair in hospital based team-cleft care activities in our environment is relatively safe. We recommend general anaesthesia with controlled ventilation for children and local anaesthesia for adult and older children who can cooperate...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare {{anaesthetic}} induction {{and recovery}} characteristics of diazepam-ketamine combination to propofol alone in dogs undergoing elective orchidectomy. Experimental design: Prospective, randomised clinical trial. Animal population: Thirty six healthy adult male dogs of various breeds weighing 5. 5 ± 2. 3 kg and aged 26 ± 13 months. Materials and Methods: After demeanour scoring (simple descriptive scale; (SDS); {{the dogs were}} sedated with morphine (0. 3 mg/kg) and acepromazine (0. 02 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Forty minutes after administration, a premedication score (SDS) was allocated. Immediately after premedication had been scored, general anaesthesia was induced with either a combination of diazepam and ketamine (D/K) or propofol (P) intravenously to facilitate <b>endotracheal</b> intubation. <b>Anaesthesia</b> was maintained with isoflurane. Scores {{for the quality of}} induction, intubation and degree of myoclonus were allocated (SDS). Orchidectomy was performed in a standard way by a single experienced surgeon. Recovery from anaesthesia was scored (SDS). Times to extubation and standing were recorded. Data were analysed for statistically significant differences using the t-test for parametric data and the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data. The Kappa Reliability and Kendall Tau tests were used to assess the degree of agreement between the scorers for the scored characteristics. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in age, weight, cage rest score, premedication score and duration of maintenance of anaesthesia. Group P was associated with a poorer quality of induction and more pronounced myoclonus; but had better quality of recovery and shorter recovery times compared to group D/K. Conclusions: Diazepam-ketamine and propofol are associated with acceptable induction and recovery from anaesthesia. Propofol had inferior anaesthetic induction characteristics, but better and quicker recovery from anaesthesia compared to diazepam-ketamine in male dogs premedicated with morphine and acepromazine.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Althesin on adrenocortical and thyroid {{function}} were investigated by measuring plasma concentrations of cortisol, thyroxine (T 4) and free thyroxine index (FTI) in 29 surgical patients. Althesin {{did not change}} the plasma cortisol concentra-tions from the preanaesthetic control value; however, the concentrations increased significantly {{after the start of}} surgery and thereafter. Althesin anaesthesia per se decreased slightly, but significantly, plasma T 4 concentration, but did not influence the FTI value. The surgical operation increased the FTI value slightly but signifi-cantly. Our data would suggest that Althesin anaesthesia can be used in patients who have abnormal adrenocortical or thyroid activity. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of Althesin on thyroid-adrenal function in 29 patients. Although Althesin has been studied extensively, little information is available regarding its endocrine effects in man. Since Althesin is a potent pregnane derivative, an evaluation of these actions in man is important in determining the safety of the drug in anaesthetic practice. METHODS Twenty-nine patients, aged 16 - 62 years, under-going surgical procedures, were studied (tables I and II). None had any clinical evidence of endo-crine disorder or of impaired renal, hepatic or cardiovascular function, and none had received corticosteroids.

Hence distilled water as an alternative agent to air for inflation of cuffs of endotracheal tubes was used for our study. Our aim is to investigate the difference in increase of intra-cuff pressure with time during laparoscopic surgical procedures under general <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> with Nitrous oxide+ Oxygen+ relaxant technique when cuffs of endotracheal tube were inflated by air & distilled water. METHODS Fifty patients (n= 50) undergoing different laparoscopic surgical procedures under general <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> were randomly divided into 2 groups. In group A, air was used & in group D, distilled water was used to inflate the cuffs of endotracheal tubes. General anaesthesia was given with Nitrous oxide+ Oxygen+ relaxant technique. The intra-cuff pressures of endotracheal tube cuffs were recorded in the beginning {{and at the end}} of laparoscopic surgical procedures. Increase of pressures with time were recorded and analysed. RESULTS In group in whom we inflated the cuffs with air, there was a significant increase in intra-cuff pressures with time and there was definite diffusion of gases into the cuffs. Increase of pressure with time was statistically highly significant (P= 0. 00001). But in group in whom we used distilled water to inflate the cuffs, there was no change in the volume of water used for inflation and water came out of cuffs at the end of the laparoscopic surgical procedures. No additional air could be aspirated from the cuffs at the end of laparoscopic surgeries in distilled water group, indicating that there was no diffusion of gases into the cuffs or the gases diffused got dissolved in distilled water. Hence there was no increase of volume distilled water. Hence there was absolutely no change of intra cuff pressure with time in distilled water group of patients. Absolutely, no change of intra-cuff volume and pressure with time in distilled water group. There was statistically significant increase of intra-cuff pressure with time (P= 0. 00001) in group of patients in whom we used air to inflate the cuffs of endotracheal tubes.

Insertion and ventilation using the laryngeal mask in 16 anaesthetised, paralysed female patients was successful, achieving a seal greater than 20 cm H2O in all patients. Emergence from anaesthesia was also noted to be uneventful and only 3 patients complained of a sore throat, a marked contrast to <b>endotracheal</b> tube <b>anaesthesia.</b> Following {{the success of the}} initial study, Dr Brain successfully inserted and ventilated 6 anaesthetised, non-paralysed patients. Finding no difference {{between the first and second}} group of patients, Dr Brain realised that muscle relaxtion was not required for insertion. Finally, Dr Brain used the device in a dental extraction patient, he realised that because the space in and around the glottis was filled by the mask, the need for packing was much reduced and more impressively the larynx was completely protected from surgical debris. Brain realised the exciting possibility that the laryngeal mask could be applied to head and neck surgery [...] and also observed that [...] "In two patients the anatomy was such as to suggest that endotracheal intubation might have presented at least moderate difficulty. Neither presented difficulty with regard to insertion of the laryngeal mask [...] ". By 1985, experience with the laryngeal mask prototype had reached 4000 cases. Dr Brain published a case series in Anaesthesia in 1985 describing the management of 3 difficult airway patients, illustrating the use of the laryngeal mask for airway rescue. Dr Brain with 5 co-authors published a second paper in anaesthesia describing the use of the laryngeal mask in over 500 patients, adding considerable credence to the laryngeal mask concept. However the limitation of the prototypes remained, a new material was urgently needed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anaesthesia in rabbits is {{associated}} with a high mortality rate, compared to that in cats and dogs. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits. The aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam in eight New Zealand White rabbits. Subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine (0. 1 mg/kg BW) was followed by IV administration of a mixture of 2. 5 μg/mL sufentanil and 0. 45 mg/mL midazolam at a rate of 0. 3 mL/kg BW/h for anaesthetic induction. Additionally, intravenous boluses of 0. 1 mL of the mixture were administered every 20 s until the righting reflex was lost. Following <b>endotracheal</b> intubation, <b>anaesthesia</b> was maintained for 60 min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex. Air and oxygen (1 : 2) were delivered at 3 L/min. Physiological variables were recorded before induction and at predefined time points during and after anaesthesia. Results Righting and pedal withdrawal reflexes were lost within 3 and 5 min, respectively. Doses of sufentanil and midazolam were 0. 48 μg/kg BW and 0. 09 mg/kg BW for induction, and 0. 72 μg/kg BW/h and 0. 13 mg/kg BW/h for maintenance. Apnoea occurred in two rabbits. Induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial CO 2 partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and pH. Mean time from stopping the infusion to endotracheal extubation was 5 min, and to return of the righting reflex 7 min. Anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex. Conclusions TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation is needed to establish if the protocol is useful for rabbits undergoing surgery. </p...|$|R

Animals (estimated bodyweight 250 kg) were darted intramuscularly with 0. 08 mg kg(- 1) medetomidine and 1. 2 mg kg(- 1) ketamine. After <b>endotracheal</b> intubation, <b>anaesthesia</b> was maintained with isoflurane delivered either by circle system (100 % oxygen) or by Triservice apparatus (air or air/oxygen admixture). Heart rate (HR) respiratory rate (f(R)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and end tidal CO 2 were recorded at 5 -minute intervals. Atipamezole was administered intramuscularly (0. 4 mg kg(- 1)) {{at the end of}} the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (p < 0. 05). Most animals rapidly became recumbent although five hippopotami needed additional drugs to assure acceptable immobilization. There were no statistical differences in mean HR between animals with or without PKD (PKD: 34 +/- 8 beats minutes(- 1); no PKD: 33 +/- 6 beats minutes(- 1)), f(R) (PKD: 15 +/- 7 breaths minutes(- 1); no PKD; 12 +/- 5 breaths minutes(- 1)) and end tidal CO 2 (PKD: 7. 1 +/- 1. 3 kPa; no PKD: 7. 8 +/- 1. 4 kPa). SpO(2) was higher in animals receiving 100 % oxygen or air with oxygen (92 +/- 8 % and 91 +/- 9 % respectively) compared with animals receiving air only (77 +/- 5 %) (p = 0. 003). Recovery was uneventful after atipamezole administration. Follow-up: There were no apparent adverse effects after anaesthesia during a 24 -hour follow-up period. Discussion and conclusions: Medetomidine-ketamine-isoflurane induced satisfactory anaesthesia in this species. Incremental induction doses were related to remote injection and the animals' thick skin. There were no differences in anaesthetic parameters in animals with or without PKD. Supplemental oxygen should be mandatory during anaesthesia in this species...|$|R
40|$|Most {{vascular}} tumors comprise haemangiomas and hemangioendotheliomas. The peak {{of their}} incidence is usually {{seen in the}} fourth decade, whereas only 5 - 10 % of them are seen in children. Infantile haemangioendothelioma is found in newborns and is usually discovered right after birth, whereas in case of infants it can be discovered during the firstthree months after birth. Haemangioendothelioma is described as seen in various organs:central nervous system, liver, urinary tract, retroperitoneum, lungs and heart. Subcutaneous forms are fairly frequent, but in most instances they represent a cosmetic problem, though in certain cases their localisation and size may {{be the cause of}} variousfunctional difficulties. The paper presents a case of a nine-month-old female patient with a tumor in theregion of labia majora that appeared at the age of 2 months, according to what parentssaid. The patient was adequately preoperatively prepered and was operated on undergeneral <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Surgical intervention consisted of the excision to the extent of reaching the healthy tissue. Haemengioendothelioma in the region of labia majora is a rarity in terms of clinical practice. The accurate diagnosis of this tumour can be made by histopathological analysis only. Excision of tumor to the extent of reaching a healthy tissue is the treatment of choice. There are also descriptions of relapses occurring upon extensive excisions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a rare case of frontal intersinus septal air cell {{inflammation}} as a cause of headaches. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 23 -year-old patient was admitted to the Department of Otolaryngology and Laryngological Oncology for severe headaches during an upper respiratory tract infection. After neurological consultation including brain MRI and CT scanning of the paranasal sinuses, the inflammation of the frontal intersinus septal air cell was diagnosed. After examination, the patient was qualified for external osteoplasty. Under general <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> the frontal intersinus septal air cell was intraoperatively opened from the side of the right frontal sinus, the mucoid content was aspirated and a plate of bone was removed. The patient reported complete relief from headaches on the second day after surgery. DISCUSSION: According to the previous studies, the frontal intersinus septal cell is more frequent in patients with frontal sinus inflammation than in the patients without inflammatory changes. Further, the conducted research indicates that its occurrence does not result in significant disorders in the drainage and ventilation of the frontal sinuses, and as such is not likely to be the cause of inflammation. CONCLUSION: In the case of inflammatory changes in the frontal intersinus septal air cell without concomitant frontal or ethmoid sinusitis, surgery via the external approach appears to be an effective method for the radical removal of pathological changes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{incidence}} of cricoarytenoid joint fixation {{in case of}} rheumatoid arthritis is 17 to 33 %. In later stages of rheumatoid arthritis, a gradual fixation of cricoarytenoid joint develops and both halves of the larynx become less movable which calls for endotracheal intubation; while total fixation of this joint demands surgical tracheotomy. Hashimoto thyroiditis can display symptoms which are difficult to distinguish from the ones present in total fixation of cricoarytenoid joint caused by rheumatoid arthritis. Case Outline. A 60 -year-old woman in terminal stage of rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto thyroiditis, diagnosed after clinical and other examinations. She was treated for strident breathing with surgical tracheotomy. The microscopic examination of the larynx {{with the use of}} laryngoscopic pincers suggested the immovability of the right and very limited movability of the left arytenoid cartilage. A computerized endovideostroboscopy showed only passive vertical vibrating movements of the right vocal cord and irregular vibrations of the left vocal cord. Conclusion. Total fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint can be caused by many pathological processes, but so far references have shown no case of rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In differential diagnostics, one of many examinations is the microscopic examination of the larynx, but {{it is very important to}} determine the movability of the arytenoid cartilage with the use of appropriate instruments in total <b>endotracheal</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> while the patient is fully relaxed. Movements in cricoarytenoid joints in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and the same conditions are preserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new airway device that will improve the speed and safety of <b>endotracheal</b> intubation in <b>anaesthesia</b> and critical care. Case of need, design specification and fabrication of the steerable bougie mechanism is discussed. Aims: Identify the need for a novel steerable bougie whilst considering technology readiness levels associated with medical device design. Analyse and produce suitable mechanisms utilising smart materials to increase device functionality aiding successful patient intubation procedures. Methods: This work {{describes the}} total design activity that contributes to the successful development of medical devices, from case of need, to smart material actuation mechanisms. Research focuses on identifying a suitable control mechanism to allow a steerable tip to be integrated into a bougie with a control device attached to the laryngoscope. Results: Data collected from a user group survey supported {{the development of a}} novel bougie, with better shape retention, variable rigidity within the tip, and an integrated steerable function. Analysis of several mechanisms, artificial muscles, and smart materials identified a cost-effective steerable mechanism that can be incorporated into a bougie. Conclusion: Users have defined a need for an improved bougie. Controlling smart materials and mechanisms, within the predefined dimensions, identified strengths and weaknesses associated with steerable functions. The performance of the selected mechanism for incorporation requires a high level of control to accurately steer a device within the human airway...|$|R
40|$|Transbronchial biopsy using forceps (TBB) is {{the first}} {{diagnostic}} technique performed on patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, {{the small size of}} the samples and the presence of artefacts in the tissue obtained make the yield variable. Our objectives were 1) to attempt to reproduce transbronchial cryobiopsy under the same conditions with which we performed conventional TBB, that is, in the bronchoscopy unit without intubating the patient and without fluoroscopy or general anaesthesia; 2) to describe the method used for its execution; and 3) to analyse the diagnostic yield and its complications. We carried out a prospective study that included 106 patients with clinical and radiological features suggestive of ILD who underwent cryo-transbronchial lung biopsy (cryo-TBB) under moderate sedation without <b>endotracheal</b> intubation, general <b>anaesthesia</b> or use of fluoroscopy. We performed the procedure using two flexible bronchoscopes connected to two video processors, which we alternated until obtaining the number of desired samples. A definitive diagnosis was obtained in 91 patients (86 %). As for complications, there were five pneumothoraces (4. 7 %) and in no case was there severe haemorrhage or exacerbation of the underlying interstitial disease. Cryo-TBB following our method is a minimally invasive, rapid, safe and economic technique that can be performed in a bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation without the need for intubating the patient or using fluoroscopy and without requiring general anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} propofol, on isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and cardiovascular function in mechanically ventilated goats. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, crossover experimental study. ANIMALS: Six goats, three does and three wethers. METHODS: General anaesthesia was induced with isoflurane in oxygen. Following <b>endotracheal</b> intubation, <b>anaesthesia</b> was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was applied. Baseline isoflurane MAC was determined, the noxious stimulus used being clamping a claw. The goats then received, on separate occasions, three propofol treatments intravenously: bolus of 0. 5 mg kg- 1 followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of 0. 05 mg kg- 1 minute- 1 (Treatment LPROP); bolus of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 followed by a CRI of 0. 1 mg kg- 1 minute- 1 (Treatment MPROP), bolus of 2. 0 mg kg- 1 followed by a CRI of 0. 2 mg kg- 1 minute- 1 (Treatment HPROP). Isoflurane MAC was re-determined following propofol treatments. Plasma propofol concentrations {{at the time of}} MAC confirmation were measured. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the anaesthetic period. Quality of recovery was scored. The Friedman test was used to test for differences between isoflurane MACs. Medians of repeatedly measured cardiovascular parameters were tested for differences between and within treatments using repeated ANOVA by ranks. (P < 0. 05 for statistical significance). RESULTS: Isoflurane MAC [median (interquartile range) ] was 1. 37 (1. 36 - 1. 37) vol%. Propofol CRI significantly reduced the isoflurane MAC, to 1. 15 (1. 08 - 1. 15), 0. 90 (0. 87 - 0. 93) and 0. 55 (0. 49 - 0. 58) vol% following LPROP, MPROP and HPROP treatment, respectively. Increasing plasma propofol concentrations strongly correlated (Spearman rank correlation) with decrease in MAC (Rho = 0. 91). Cardiovascular function was not affected significantly by propofol treatment. Quality of recovery was satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In goats, propofol reduces isoflurane MAC in a dose-dependent manner with minimal cardiovascular effects.
