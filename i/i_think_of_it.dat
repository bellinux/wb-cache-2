25|$|I must, however, {{make clear}} what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a {{recognised}} creed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a {{tendency of the}} mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.|$|E
500|$|Tim Minear was {{selected}} by Whedon to be the show runner, who serves as the head writer and production leader. According to Whedon [...] " [...] understood the show {{as well as any}} human being, and just brought so much to it that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as though he were always a part of it". Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, {{with the exception of the}} director of photography David Boyd, who was the [...] "big find" [...] and who was [...] "full of joy and energy".|$|E
500|$|Part of the 2001 {{playback}} {{scene was}} included in Martin Scorsese's documentary , and an early take from the 1970 sessions appeared on the bonus disc accompanying that film's DVD release in late 2011. This demo version, which Harrison introduces as [...] "Awaiting for You All", was included on the compilation [...] (2012). Referring to Harrison's stated regret {{at the amount of}} echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles Martin says of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: [...] "I think this is really cool, it's got a good basic band groove, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as George breaking down a wall of sound." ...|$|E

6000|$|The woman stirred impatiently in her chair, as if both voices {{had been}} repeating {{something}} heard many times before. They seemed to renew her discontent.

500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> of course, it was the wrong thing to do, especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E
2500|$|His mother was, in many ways, {{instrumental}} {{in his ability}} to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: [...] "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall {{have to wait and see}} what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?" ...|$|E
2500|$|I don’t {{think of}} it as straddling. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as {{changing}} the line. What I’ve been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less defined. Both by the culture and by the post-War economic situation. Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in fact, they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of [...] "high art." [...] In the West, it certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people will throw all sorts of stones. But that's okay—I’m ready with my hard hat.|$|E

2500|$|Edmund Burke {{was deeply}} upset by this letter and brought forth from Burke a [...] "severe remonstrance" [...] to Fitzwilliam [...] "which {{affected}} Lord Fitzwilliam {{so much that}} he kept to his bed, and was actually ill for several days. When Burke heard this he was so much hurt in his turn, that he went to Lord Fitzwilliam and the whole thing was made up". However Burke still felt unable to receive money from Fitzwilliam, declining it on 29 November. Fox wrote to William Adam on 15 December that Fitzwilliam's [...] "unremitting kindness to me in all situations quite oppresses me when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> God knows, there is nothing on earth consistent with principle and honour that I would not do to continue his political friend, as I shall always be his warmest and most attached private friend".|$|E
2500|$|David Brading {{was born}} in London, England and educated at St Ignatius' College and Pembroke College, Cambridge where he read History and {{obtained}} a BA (Hons) Double first-class honours in 1960. He was an Exhibitioner and Foundation Scholar at Cambridge University where he attended the lectures of David Knowles, Geoffrey Elton, and Michael Postan. In 1961 he was awarded a Henry Fellowship to Yale University.But it was later that year, whilst in Mexico, that Brading’s fascination with the country began, “I have now found my field of study: sixteenth-century Spain and Latin America”…The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> the more Latin America seems attractive. Sixteenth–century Spain, looking back to the Reconquista and forward to the Counter Reformation and the decadence. The nature of its Catholicism, its mysticism, the history of its expansion, the Jesuits, its art, architecture and poetry. Latin America with its archaeology and anthropology, {{the nature of its}} liberalism and its revolutions.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen has said, [...] "My screen work often funds my theatre career – that's the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Theatre {{is where}} my heart and soul is, where I feel {{absolutely}} vocational. Creatively, theatre is the most democratic forum for an actor because you have near total control over your performance. It's also where the playwright can never be censored and, as such, {{that makes it a}} truly democratic forum for debate. And the communal experience, the chemistry that you get between actors and audience can be extraordinary. It can move you in a way that film can't. That's the power of theatre at its best." [...] The role that he would most like to play is Macbeth; other roles on his wish-list include Iago in Othello, Brick in Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Lenny in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming, and Hamlet [...] "as long as no one gives it to me because it's completely daunting".|$|E

2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E
