40|$|Remittance {{is called}} the life blood of Bangladesh economy.

In Bangladesh microcredit will be an important tool in earning remittance. Microfinance Institutions in Bangladesh can play its role in two stages – a) pre-stage and b) post stage. In pre stage MFIs can work as an important source of money for migration and MFIs can also trained migrant worker according to their importers’ demand which helps workers to improve their efficiency. This helps Bangladesh to earn more remittance which helps <b>in</b> reducing <b>poverty.</b> <b>In</b> post stages MFIs can help migrant worker to send money and also work for proper utilization of this remitted money. This helps to create entrepreneurs which help to create employment, which help to reduce <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> Bangladesh. This whole process is discussed in this paper elaborately. ...|$|R
