5|$|This {{process was}} {{temporarily}} halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims. Following a <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> by the Ontario Divisional Court on November 7, 2005, the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles {{was ordered to}} begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees.

On February 24, 2006, the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to appeal the 2005 decision. As a result, plate denial remains in place.|$|E
5|$|With legal appeals, {{petitions}} from {{subjects and}} judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were careful {{to consult with}} the jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From the reign of Augustus (27BC–AD14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship {{gave rise to the}} earliest law school system of the Western world, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with Denmark in 1989, {{civil unions}} under one name or another have been {{established}} by law in several, mostly developed, countries {{in order to provide}} legal recognition of relationships formed by unmarried same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, tax breaks, and responsibilities similar or identical to those of legally married couples.

25|$|Historically, {{floating}} charges are a fascinating concept {{in that they}} are legal devices created entirely by lawyers in private practice; there is no legislation and no <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> that was the genesis of a floating charge.

25|$|The 1910 {{election}} saw 42 Labour MPs {{elected to}} the House of Commons, a significant victory since, {{a year before the}} election, the House of Lords had passed the Osborne judgment ruling that Trades Unions in the United Kingdom could no longer donate money to fund the election campaigns and wages of Labour MPs. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{differences}} in the social structure of society, the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century. On the continent, mineral deposits belonged to the crown, and this regalian right was stoutly maintained. But in England, royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver (of which England had virtually no deposits) by a <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> of 1568 and a law in 1688. England had iron, zinc, copper, lead, and tin ores. Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators. English, German, and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining. Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at Keswick in the northwestern mountains.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of precedent in the judgments of international criminal courts and tribunals. It finds that although such courts and tribunals have resorted to external <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law, in some cases, their use of external <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> has been equivocal. Moreover, in two notable cases, these courts and tribunals have unequivocally relied on precedent as a direct source of law. In this context, the article offers some reflections on whether courts may serve as sources {{for the creation of}} rules of law. It finds that there {{does not seem to be}} any legal basis for the use of external <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> as direct sources of rules of international law. There is, moreover, a danger that regarding external <b>judicial</b> <b>decisions</b> as direct sources may encourage a lax, uncritical reliance on such decisions...|$|R
25|$|Ashkenazi forestalled the magisterial {{action by}} resigning {{his office and}} fleeing, in the {{beginning}} of 1714, from Amsterdam, perhaps secretly, with the aid of his friend Solomon Levi Norden de Lima. After leaving his wife and children at Emden, he proceeded to London at the invitation of the Sephardic congregation of that city. In 1705 he was invited to pronounce a <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> concerning the orthodoxy of the rabbi David Nieto, who, in a certain sermon, had given utterance to allegedly Spinozistic views. In London Ashkenazi found many friends, and received many tributes of regard. Even before this he had been invited to take the rabbinate of the Sephardic congregation, but refused. It seems that his portrait in oil was painted here, after he had refused, on account of religious scruples, to have his bust stamped on a coin. In the following spring he returned to Emden, and proceeded thence to Poland by way of Hanover, Halberstadt, Berlin, and Breslau, stopping at each place for some time. After spending two years in Staszów, Poland, he was called to Hamburg to serve as member of a judicial body convened to settle a complicated legal question.|$|E
25|$|The <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> in Murcia raised {{speculation}} {{in other}} constituencies where results had been appealed {{that the local}} Superior Courts would follow suit similarly. In Pontevedra, where the number of votes counted was determined to exceed the number of voters, the Court ruled for the election to be held again. Finally, the Superior Court of Andalusia ruled that the election in Melilla was void, but dismissed the appeal on Ceuta where it declared {{the validity of the}} election. González's government announced that it would appeal the decision to the Constitutional Court which, on 25 January 1990, ruled to provisionally suspend the repetition of the legislative elections in Murcia, Pontevedra and Melilla. From 15 to 19 February, the Court overruled the Superior Courts of Justice of Murcia and Galicia and annulled the elections for Murcia and Pontevedra, with declared results being ruled as valid and final. However, it determined that the magnitude of the irregularities found in Melilla was such that a new election was required in the constituency for both the Congress and the Senate, thus definitely ruling as void the results of 29 October. On 25 March 1990, the by-election in Melilla resulted in the PP being awarded the constituency's seat and the two senators from the Socialists, who saw their absolute majority in the Congress snatched away. A by-election was also held on 7 October 1990 in a polling station in Mamblas, Ávila, resulting from a judicial conflict between the PP and the CDS over one senator in the constituency. In the end, the election result allowed the PP to win the disputed senator from the CDS.|$|E
500|$|In 1649 Dudley was {{appointed}} {{once again to}} serve as a commissioner and president of the New England Confederation, an umbrella organization established by most of the New England colonies to address issues of common interest; however, he was ill (and aging, at 73), and consequently unable to discharge his duties in that office. [...] Despite the illness, Dudley was elected governor for the fourth and last time in 1650. [...] The most notable acts during this term were the issuance of a new charter for Harvard College, and the <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> to burn The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption, a book by Springfield resident William Pynchon that expounded on religious views heretical to the ruling Puritans. [...] Pynchon was called upon to retract his views, but he chose to return to England instead of facing the magistrates.|$|E

500|$|Varina {{and their}} young {{daughter}} Winnie {{were allowed to}} join Davis, and the family was eventually given {{an apartment in the}} officers' quarters. Davis was indicted for treason while imprisoned; one of his attorneys was ex-Governor Thomas Pratt of Maryland. There {{was a great deal of}} discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis, and there was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet to do so. [...] Although Davis wanted such a trial for himself, there were no treason trials against anyone, as it was felt they would probably not succeed and would impede reconciliation. There was also a concern at the time that such action could result in a <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> that would validate the constitutionality of secession (later removed by the Supreme Court ruling in Texas v.

500|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{claims in}} Florida, some already considered by Crittenden {{during his first}} term as attorney general, continued during his second term. Specifically, some of the claimants objected to a legal provision, passed by Congress years after the Adams–Onís Treaty, that allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse to pay claims awarded by Florida courts that he found not to be [...] "just and equitable". The claimants contended that this allowed an executive officer to overrule a <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> {{in violation of the}} doctrine of separation of powers. Crittenden held that the secretary's ruling was just as much a judicial action as that of the Florida judges. Further, he reiterated his 1841 decision that no interest could be paid on claims arising from damages resulting from Jackson's invasion. Despite this opinion, a Florida judge awarded interest to one of the claimants, and the government appealed the case to the Supreme Court, with Crittenden serving as the government's counsel. The Court upheld Crittenden's entire opinion in its ruling.|$|E
500|$|The {{legality}} of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the London Borough of Bromley council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to a court of appeal, where three judges – Lord Denning, Lord Justice Oliver and Lord Justice Watkins – reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November. They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit, even if {{this was in the}} perceived interest of Londoners. The GLC appealed this decision, taking the case to the House of Lords; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council, putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy. GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges [...] "Vandals in Ermine" [...] while Livingstone maintained his belief that the <b>judicial</b> <b>decision</b> was politically motivated.|$|E
