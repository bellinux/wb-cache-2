40|$|Abstract-A {{formulation}} {{consisting of}} the pyrethroid insecticide alphacypermethrin and <b>flufenoxuron,</b> an acylurea insect growth regulator, {{has been shown to}} give effective and persistent control of cockroach infestations after a single treatment. <b>Flufenoxuron</b> is a new high performance residual insecticide for public hygiene pest control which kills insects by interference with chitin formation. Failure of the chitin to develop properly results in the death of arthropods during ecdysis. Although not an adulticide, a high proportion of eggs laid by an adult after exposure to <b>flufenoxuron</b> are non-viable. Combining alphacypermethrin and <b>flufenoxuron</b> ensures both persistence and effective insecticidal activity at all stages of the pest life-cycle.

However, information about the relation between runoff-related pesticides and communities of benthic macroinvertebrates in stormwater wetland that receive agricultural runoff does not currently exist. Here we show changes in macroinvertebrates communities of a stormwater wetland that collects pesticidecontaminated runoff from a vineyard catchment. Sixteen runoff-associated pesticides, including the insecticide <b>flufenoxuron,</b> were continuously quantified at the inlet of the stormwater wetland from April to September (period of pesticide application). In parallel, benthic macroinvertebrate communities, pesticide concentrations, and physicochemical parameters in the wetland were assessed twice a month. Twenty-eight contaminated runoffs ranging from 1. 1 to 114 m 3 entered the wetland during the study period. <b>Flufenoxuron</b> concentrations in runoff-suspended solids ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 5 lg kg- 1 and reached 6 lg kg- 1 in the wetland sediments. However, <b>flufenoxuron</b> could not be detected in water. The density, diversity, and abundance of macroinvertebrates largely varied over time. Redundancy and formal concept analyses showed that concentrations of <b>flufenoxuron,</b> vegetation cover, and flow conditions significantly determine the community structures of stormwater wetland macroinvertebrates.

On the bases of pest progeny development and percent damage, the wheat genotypes were most susceptible as compared to rice and maize. Results regarding the larval mortality revealed that the highest mortality was caused by <b>flufenoxuron.</b> Adult suppression was highest due to the <b>flufenoxuron</b> and lowest in triflumeron. Highest ovicidal action was exerted by pyriproxyfen where only 32. 83 % hatching was recorded in T. castaneum eggs followed by lufenuron at 10 ppm while methoxyfenozide was least effective. Similarly, in T. granarium, the hatching suppression was highest (38. 83 % hatching) due to pyriproxyfen treatment and was lowest in methoxyfenozide treatment. Growth rate was highly effected by pyriproxyfen and least effected by methoxyfenozide against both insects. The highest adult mortality was 20. 78 and 20. 23 % due to the application of triflumeron and <b>flufenoxuron,</b> respectively and was lowest (6. 63 %) where tebufenozide was applied against T. granarium. In T. castaneum the highest adult mortality (37. 64 %) and lowest (6. 84 %) were due to exposure of triflumeron and tebufenozide, respectively. Significant reduction in fecundity and fertility of both inesects was also recorded due to the adult exposure to IGRs treated diet. Fecundity was significant reduced in tebufenozide treatment application followed by methoxyfenozide while buprofezin and pyriproxyfen have little effect on T. castaneum and T. granarium. Our results regarding the effect on fertility of adults exposed to IGRs treated diet indicated that pyriproxyfen was the most effective in suppressing the egg hatching and tebufenozide was the least effective against both insects. Progeny production was minimum in pyriproxyfen and highest in tebufenozide against both targeted insects. Bioactivities of all the tested IGRs {{were found to be}} dose and exposure period dependent.

Reselection of a Cameron Highlands population with teflubenzuron after 22 generations resulted in a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in resistance after three generations. In two more recently collected strains from lowland Malaysia, Sawi (1991) and Serdang (1992) high levels of resistance to teflubenzuron were found, but only the former showed any apparent resistance to chlorfluazuron. There was also evidence of resistance to diflubenzuron in the Sawi strain (Serdang not examined). Resistance to teflubenzuron appeared to be unstable in unselected sub-populations of both lowland strains. Selection of the Sawi strain with teflubenzuron did not effect cross-resistance to chlorfluazuron, while attempted selection with chlorfluazuron {{had no effect on}} resistance to either compound. Selection of the Sawi strain with diflubenzuron increased resistance to teflubenzuron but had no effect on resistance to chlorfluazuron. In contrast to the Sawi strain, selection of the Serdang strain with teflubenzuron resulted in cross-resistance to chlorfluazuron. Synergist experiments with piperonyl butoxide (PB) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) suggested that resistance to teflubenzuron in the lowland strains may involve both microsomal monooxygenases and esterases.

Results were similar whether blocks were leached or unleached. The earliest mortality occurred in the 400 ppm treatments between the fifth and sixth week of testing. All levels of flurox treatments proved toxic to C. acinaciformis, within eight weeks. Termite mortality over the test period in the water treated and solvent treated controls remained at ten per cent. Flurox stimulated active termite feeding and tended to override the termitesâ tendency to âmud-upâ their food source and surroundings. This suggests a strong âattractancy-feeding responseâ induced by flurox. Since there was no significant difference between toxicity levels in the leached and unleached blocks it may be concluded that flurox was firmly bound to the wood substrate of the timber specimens. These laboratory results strongly indicate that flurox has a role as a potential termite bait toxicant, particularly against Coptotermes species.

There results suggest that dimethoate, cyromazine, spinosad,phenthoate, and cartap can be rotationally used for L. chinensis control...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWetlands {{can collect}} {{contaminated}} runoff from agricultural catchments and retain dissolved and particle-laden pesticides. However, {{knowledge about the}} capacity and functioning of wetland systems {{with respect to the}} removal of pesticides is very limited. Here we show that stormwater wetlands can efficiently remove pesticides in runoff from vineyard catchments during the period of pesticide application, although flow and hydrochemical conditions of the wetland largely vary over time. During the entire agricultural season, the inflowing load of nine fungicides, six herbicides, one insecticide and four degradation products was 8. 039 g whereas the outflowing load was 2. 181 g. Removal rates of dissolved loads by the wetland ranged from 39 % (simazine) to 100 % (cymoxanil, gluphosinate, kresoxim methyl and terbuthylazine). Dimethomorph, diuron, glyphosate, metalaxyl and tetraconazole were more efficiently removed in spring than in summer. More than 88 % of the input mass of suspended solids was retained, underscoring the capability of the wetland to trap pesticide-laden particles via sedimentation. Only the insecticide <b>flufenoxuron</b> was frequently detected in the wetland sediments. Our results demonstrate that stormwater wetlands can efficiently remove pesticide mixtures in agricultural runoff during critical periods of pesticide application, although fluctuations in the runoff regime and hydrochemical characteristics can affect the removal rates of individual pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Foliar {{sprays of}} {{pesticides}} are frequently {{used to control}} two-spotted mites on rose flowers, but these also destroy predatory mites and pose {{a high risk of}} contamination for humans and the environment. Using a novel approach to avoid spray applications on rose plants, modified acaricide-treated string curtains were adapted to control the pest. Two main aims of this study were: (i) to identify the lethal concentration of string curtains treated with propargite, dicofol, <b>flufenoxuron,</b> acrinathrin or taufluvalinate (s-fluvalinate) on Tetranychus urticae, and (ii) to test the design (feasibility) and efficiency of the string curtains to trap the phytophagous mites on the plants during their circadian migration. Bioassay results in the lab confirmed T. urticae circadian migration, toxicity of the five kinds of treated string curtains and a concentration-dependent repellent effect of each chemical on T. urticae females. Of the two products tested in the field, dicofol was more effective than acrinathrin in controlling T. urticae compared to an acaricidal spray of the same products. The effect of acaricide-treated string curtain use on Phytoseiulus persimilis did not differ significantly from the control. The string curtain technique proved to be effective, but because of some biotic and abiotic constraints and the low economic threshold of mites, even for the commercialized high canopy stem roses, the present device could be more appropriate for another horticultural crop, e. g. tomato.

40|$|Spanish Cydia pomonella (L.) field {{populations have}} {{developed}} resistance to several insecticide groups. Diagnostic concentrations were established as the LC 90 calculated on a susceptible strain (S_Spain) for five and seven insecticides and tested on eggs and neonate larvae field populations, respectively. The three most relevant enzymatic detoxification systems (mixed-function oxidases (MFO), glutathione S-tranferases (GST) and esterases (EST)) were studied for neonate larvae. In eggs, 96 % {{of the field}} populations showed a significantly lower efficacy {{when compared with the}} susceptible strain (S_Spain) and the most effective insecticides were fenoxycarb and thiacloprid. In neonate larvae, a significant loss of susceptibility to the insecticides was detected. <b>Flufenoxuron,</b> azinphos-methyl and phosmet showed the lowest efficacy, while lambda-cyhalothrin, alpha-cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos-ethyl showed the highest. Biochemical assays showed that the most important enzymatic system involved in insecticide detoxification was MFO, with highest enzymatic activity ratios (5. 1 – 16. 6 for neonates from nine field populations). An enhanced GST and EST activities was detected in one field population, with enzymatic activity ratios of threefold and fivefold for GST and EST, respectively, when compared with the susceptible strain. The insecticide bioassays showed that the LC 90 used were effective as diagnostic concentrations. Measures of MFO activity alongside bioassays with insecticide diagnostic concentrations could be used as tools for monitoring insecticide resistance in neonate larvae of C. pomonella...|$|E
40|$|The acaricides clofentezine, {{hexythiazox}} and etoxazole {{are commonly}} referred to as ‘mite growth inhibitors’, and clofentezine and hexythiazox have been used successfully for the integrated control of plant mite pests for decades. Although they are still important today, their mode of action has remained elusive. Recently, a mutation in chitin synthase 1 (CHS 1) was linked to etoxazole resistance. In this study, we identified and investigated a Tetranychus urticae strain (HexR) harboring recessive, monogenic resistance to each of hexythiazox, clofentezine, and etoxazole. To elucidate if there is a common genetic basis for the observed cross-resistance, we adapted a previously developed bulk segregant analysis method to map with high resolution a single, shared resistance locus for all three compounds. This finding indicates that the underlying molecular basis for resistance to all three compounds is identical. This locus is centered on the CHS 1 gene, and as supported by additional genetic and biochemical studies, a non-synonymous variant (I 1017 F) in CHS 1 associates with resistance to each of the tested acaricides in HexR. Our findings thus demonstrate a shared molecular mode of action for the chemically diverse mite growth inhibitors clofentezine, hexythiazox and etoxazole as inhibitors of an essential, non-catalytic activity of CHS 1. Given the previously documented cross-resistance between clofentezine, hexythiazox and the benzyolphenylurea (BPU) compounds <b>flufenoxuron</b> and cycloxuron, CHS 1 should be also considered as a potential target-site of insecticidal BPUs...|$|E

40|$|A new {{analytical}} procedure {{was developed and}} validated, using liquid chromatography, for simultaneous determination of seven new pesticides belonging to different chemical classes (azoles, strobilurines, benzoylureas, and a new oxazolidinedione) in apple, grape and wine food samples. Solvent extraction of pesticides was performed using a cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 + 1 v/v) mixture and the extract was cleaned-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using silica cartridges and elution with tetrahydrofurane. Separation of pesticides flusilazole, fenbuconazole, diniconazole, tebufenozide, famoxadone, trifloxystrobin and <b>flufenoxuron</b> was performed by gradient elution High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a microbore Hypersil HS C 18 column in 35 min total time, using mixtures of acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. Pesticides were detected and quantified at 210 nm with a variable-wavelength UV detector. Recoveries of pesticides from spiked samples, at 0. 05 - 2. 0 mg kg- 1 for apple and grape and at 0. 025 - 0. 250 mg L- 1 for wine, ranged from 82 to 107 % for apple and grape and from 87 % to 106 % for wine with RSD 12 %. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of the method, as a {{signal to noise ratio}} equalled 10, ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 10 mg kg- 1 for apple and grape and from 0. 005 to 0. 02 mg L- 1 for wine samples. The uncertainty associated with the analytical methodology, estimated using the 'bottom-up' approach, was lower than 12. 8 % for all pesticides and matrices tested.

The tested IGRs were applied in maize at three doses (1, 5, and 10 ppm) and assessed at three temperature levels (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) {{in the case of}} P. truncatus, while in the case of R. dominica the above doses were assessed only at 25 degrees C in wheat. In addition to progeny production, mortality of the treated adults after 14 days of exposure in the IGR-treated commodities was assessed. All IGRs were very effective (> 88. 5 % suppression of progeny) against the tested species at doses of >= 5 ppm, while diflubenzuron at 25 degrees C in the case of P. truncatus or lufenuron and pyriproxyfen in the case of R. dominica completely suppressed (100 %) progeny production when they were applied at 1 ppm. At all tested doses, the highest values of R. dominica parental mortality were observed in wheat treated with lufenuron plus fenoxycarb. Temperature at the levels examined in the present study did not appear to affect the overall performance in a great extent of the tested IGRs in terms of adult mortality or suppression of progeny production against P. truncatus in treated maize.

40|$|Problems with Tetranychus urticae are {{frequently}} reported in protected crops in Italy, particularly in roses where many introduced acaricides show a progressive loss of effectiveness. We have conducted bioassays {{to assess the}} response of some Italian strains of T. urticae {{to a number of}} acaricides. These include compounds that were widespread and frequently used in the past, but also some recently registered compounds. We investigated two T. urticae strains collected from rose growers where control failures were reported (SAN and PSE), together with a strain collected from unsprayed vegetables (BOSA). Adult females of the rose strains (SAN and PSE) were resistant to tebufenpyrad (Resistant Ratio—RR, RR 50 = 48. 4 and 163. 6) and fenpyroximate (RR 50 = 74. 1 and 25. 9) when compared to the susceptible BOSA strain. Lethal concentrations for these products were higher than the registered field rate. The PSE strain proved to be highly resistant to abamectin (RR 50 = 1, 294. 1). Variation in bifenazate susceptibility was detected amongst strains, but LC 90 values of SAN and PSE were still in the range of the registered field rate. In egg bioassays, the SAN and PSE strains exhibited high resistance levels to clofentezine (RR 50 = 66, 473 and 170, 714), hexythiazox (RR 50 = 70, 244 and 159, 493) and <b>flufenoxuron</b> (RR 50 = 61. 9 and 117. 9). But the recently introduced ovi/larvicides etoxazole and spirodiclofen exhibited high activity on all strains. The activity of detoxifying enzymes such as esterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (MFOs) was determined in these strains as a preliminary attempt to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Enzymatic assays showed that the rose strains exhibited 2. 66 and 1. 95 -fold increased MFOs activity compared to the susceptible strain. Assays for GSTs revealed that only the SAN strain exhibited a significantly higher activity. In contrast, only the PSE strain showed a significant higher hydrolysis of 1 -naphthyl acetate...|$|E
