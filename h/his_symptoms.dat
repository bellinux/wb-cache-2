5|$|In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris {{from his}} house at Égreville to see his doctor. The {{composer}} had been suffering from abdominal cancer for some months, but <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> did not seem imminently life-threatening. Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His wife and family hastened to Paris, and were {{with him when he}} died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with no music, was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil can control <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{internal}} hernia that was difficult to diagnose in long-term follow-up after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer. A 75 -yearold man, who had undergone laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer with antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction after open distal gastrectomy for a gastric ulcer, frequently presented slight temporary postprandial abdominal pain. <b>His</b> <b>symptom</b> was, however, reduced by diet therapy. After being discharged from hospital, he continued to complain of slight abdominal pain. He was admitted to our hospital with postprandial abdominal pain four months after surgery. An upper gastrointestinal study and abdominal CT could not reveal the cause of <b>his</b> <b>symptom.</b> <b>His</b> <b>symptom</b> was getting gradually worse, and we decided on surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity. The day before the operation, CT showed mesenteric vessel twisting for the first time. The operative findings revealed the entire small intestine had herniated through a mesenteric defect of jejunostomy. The herniated intestine had no ischemic change. It was repaired manually, and the defect was closed by interrupted suture. It {{is important to consider}} internal hernia for patients with nonspecific abdominal pain who have undergone laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction...|$|R

5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} Valparaiso on 23 July. After several {{walks in the}} area, Darwin {{obtained}} horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic Andes with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on {{the summit of the}} Bell mountain. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. <b>His</b> <b>symptoms</b> started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able to go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

25|$|On 22 October, Maalin {{fell ill}} with fever and headache, and {{received}} malaria treatment in hospital. After {{four days a}} rash appeared. Perhaps working {{on the assumption that}} he had been successfully vaccinated against smallpox, Maalin was then believed to have chickenpox and was discharged from hospital. Over the next few days, <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> developed to indicate smallpox as the cause. Not wishing to be put into isolation, Maalin failed to report himself. On 30 October, a male nurse colleague reported him, possibly for the reward of 200 Somali shillings (around $35), and Maalin was transferred to the isolation camp. He was diagnosed with an infection of the Variola minor strain of smallpox, based on <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> and later confirmed by laboratory tests. The date of diagnosis is sometimes stated as 26 October 1977. Maalin did not experience complications, and subsequently recovered fully and was discharged in late November.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven is {{reported}} to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over, he got up to find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).|$|E
40|$|Lung {{involvement}} {{is rare in}} Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). We encountered a male patient with WM who complained of breathlessness. Chest X-ray revealed diffuse infiltrative shadow throughout the both lungs. Transbronchial biopsy showed infiltra-tion of atypical plasmacytoid lymphocytes and non-caseating granuloma. We treated the patients with fludarabine phosphate, and both <b>his</b> <b>symptom</b> and X-ray findings were then improved. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} case showing non-caseating granuloma with lung involvement of WM. We discuss a mechanism of non-caseating granuloma forma-tion in this case...|$|R

25|$|The H. pylori {{hypothesis}} was initially poorly received, so {{in an act}} of self-experimentation Marshall drank a Petri dish containing a culture of organisms extracted from a person with an ulcer and five days later developed gastritis. <b>His</b> <b>symptoms</b> disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since halitosis is one of the symptoms of infection.

Chopin was already ill with incipient tuberculosis (or, as has recently been suggested, cystic fibrosis) {{at the beginning of}} their relationship, and spending a winter in Majorca—where Sand and Chopin did not realize that winter was a time of rain and cold, and where they could not get proper lodgings—exacerbated <b>his</b> <b>symptoms.</b> They separated two years before his death for a variety of reasons.|$|E
25|$|After the 1920 presidential election, Roosevelt {{sought to}} build support for a {{political}} comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by illness. While the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island, New Brunswick, in August 1921, Roosevelt fell ill. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with poliomyelitis at the time, but <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> are more consistent with Guillain–Barré syndrome – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.|$|E

25|$|Since Dasein (clients in therapy) is a {{relation}} being, constantly engaged in and constituted by ongoing dialogue, ontological hermeneutics states that <b>his</b> <b>symptoms,</b> concerns, and needs are occurring {{in relation to}} others and the world, and not purely in the mind as byproducts of distorted cognitive processes. Hermeneutics holds that even though other forms of therapy, such as Imago therapy, Positive psychotherapy, and Object relations acknowledge the role of relationships in the life and well-being of the client, only ontological hermeneutics fully recognizes and embraces Dasein’s relational mode of existing prior to any other abstract theorizing. Slife states {{that this is a}} significant difference between ontological hermeneutics and all other counseling theories because how a client's suffering is conceptualized will in turn result in how a client's healing is conceptualized.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most {{important}} work. As <b>his</b> <b>symptoms</b> subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. In the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, patents were considered essential, not only to protect original work, but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did—and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent firm in Worcester, who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.|$|E
25|$|It was claimed {{even before}} his death that Moscati was a miracle-worker; some {{said that he could}} {{accurately}} diagnose and prescribe for any patient merely by hearing a list of <b>his</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and that he was responsible for impossible cures. Reports of his good works continued well after his death, with further reports that he interceded in impossible cases. Consequently, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 November 1975. Moscati was canonized on 25 October 1987, by Pope John Paul II. His canonization miracle involved the case of a young ironworker dying of leukemia. The young man's mother dreamed of a doctor wearing a white coat, whom she identified as Moscati when shown a photograph. Not long after this, her son went into remission and returned to work.|$|E
