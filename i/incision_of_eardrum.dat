40|$|Development <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> {{retraction}} pocket, as pathologic finding, {{depends on}} Eustachian tube dysfunction, {{onset of the}} middle ear infection and site of development of retraction on the eardrum. The study is aimed at: 1. Determining the incidence <b>of</b> <b>eardrum</b> retraction pocket and cholesteatoma within it, {{as well as at the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>eardrum</b> retraction; 2. Determining <b>of</b> association between <b>eardrum</b> retraction pocket and changes <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> mucosaand parstensa <b>of</b> the tympanic membrane; 3. Determining of onset and intensity of the bone destruction in eardrum retraction pocket; 4. Examining of Eustachian tube function based on time of mucocilliary transport according to the type <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> retraction pocket. The study is based on the retrospective analysis of the results obtained from the patients treated at the Institute of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade for the diagnosis of the chronic suppurative otitis who underwent otosurgical procedures during the six-year period, from 1996 - 2001. In our series of 540 patients subjected to otosurgical treatment, the incidence of the retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> was 11. 23 %. Onset of more severe degree <b>of</b> <b>eardrum</b> retraction was most frequent in the attic. Cholesteatoma was detected in 82. 2 % of patients of the group with the attic-retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum,</b> as well as in 25 % of patients of the group of tensa-sinus retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum.</b> Atrophic changes <b>of</b> the tympanic membrane pars tensa were detected in almost all tensa-sinus retraction pockets <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum.</b> Approximately one half of the attic-retraction pockets <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> were accompanied by eardrum atrophy. Bone destruction of the auditory ossicles was limited to the long process of incus and superior structures of stapes. Time of the mucocilliary transport was significantly longer (p< 0. 01) in attic-retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> than in tensa-sinus retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum,</b> indicating significance <b>of</b> tube in development of attic-retraction pocket of the tympanic membrane. Reversible changes {{of the middle ear}} mucosa were evidenced in three quarters of the tensa-sinus retraction pockets <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> indicating that inflammation is the major factor influencing onset of tensa-sinus retraction pocket <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum...</b>|$|R

Either or both of these parts may become retracted. The retracted segment <b>of</b> <b>eardrum</b> is often known as a retraction pocket.

40|$|Introduction: Most {{tympanoplasty}} techniques require skin <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> {{the external}} auditory canal. This step is not without morbidity and postoperative complications such as delayed healing, granulation tissue, lateralization, blunting and iatrogenic cholesteatoma. For small or midsize non-marginalized tympanic membrane perforations of the posterior or inferior quadrants, a transmeatal approach without <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> the cutaneous epidermis of {{the external auditory}} canal can theoretically offer advantages such as rapid healing and reduced postoperative complications. In this paper we present the preliminary results of a tympanoplasty technique with a retroauricular approach without skin <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> the canal and an overlay graft. Materials and Methods: We performed 10 tympanoplasties without skin incisions for small or midsize non-marginalized perforations, which do not exceed one third of the tympanic membrane surface, located in the inferior or posterior quadrants. Results: With a minimum follow up of 3 months all patients showed excellent anatomical results without complications. Nine of them closed their average air bone gap at less than 10 dB. Conclusion: When anatomically feasible, our technique combines a post auricular approach and the absence <b>of</b> skin <b>incision.</b> It ensures rapid healing, preserves the anatomy <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> and external auditory canal and reduces the risk of blunting and lateralization phenomena. The main difficulty concerns the cleavage of the epidermal and fibrous layer...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} coupling between the eardrum and the manubrium was studied {{by means of}} a finite-element model <b>of</b> the cat <b>eardrum.</b> Previous calculations <b>of</b> the effect <b>of</b> varying the <b>eardrum</b> curvature were extended, demonstrating the critical role of curvature in the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum.</b> A new procedure was developed for directly studying the coupling of forces from different points on the eardrum to the manubrium, and the distribution of load-coupling values over the eardrum surface was calculated. A geometrically simplified eardrum with a circular outline was also studied. It was found that certain regions <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> are more effective in driving the manubrium than can be explained {{on the basis of their}} distance from the axis of rotation. This enhanced coupling depends on the curvature <b>of</b> the <b>eardrum</b> but, unlike the mechanism hypothesized by Helmholtz, requires neither tension nor anisotropy...|$|R

The anti-confocal system was experimentally evaluated on both optical middle ear phantom and human skin. Results showed e ective rejection of signals from the eardrum using a central stop replacing the confocal pinhole, while still detecting signals from the middle ear mucosa.

40|$|An {{approach}} to the detection of pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity in living cells is presented. Mutants of Escherichia coli defective in uvr functions required for <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated DNA were infected with phage T 4 denV+ or denV- (defective in the T 4 pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase activity). In the former case the denV gene product catalyzed the <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated host DNA, facilitating the subsequent excision of thymine-containing pyrimidine dimers. Isolation of these dimers from the acid-soluble fraction of infected cells was achieved by a multistep thin-layer chromatographic system. Exposure of the dimers to irradiation that monomerizes pyrimidine dimers (direct photoreversal) resulted in the stoichiometric formation of free thymine. Thus, in vivo <b>incision</b> <b>of</b> UV-irradiated DNA dependent on a pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase can be demonstrated...|$|R
