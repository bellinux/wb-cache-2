2500|$|There are two {{versions}} of the SID chip: the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original ("breadbox") C64s, the early versions of the 64C, and the Commodore 128. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. While the 6581 sound quality is a little crisper and many Commodore 64 fans say they prefer its sound, it lacks some versatility available in the 8580 – for example, the 8580 can mix all available waveforms on each channel, whereas the 6581 can only play a single waveform per channel. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage. The 6581 uses a [...] supply—the 8580, a [...] supply. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a newer 64C board (which uses the [...] chip). The SID chip's distinctive sound has allowed it to retain a following long after its host computer was discontinued.

40|$|Many {{inventory}} control studies consider either continuous review and continuous ordering, or periodic review and periodic ordering. Mixtures {{of the two}} are hardly ever studied. However, the model with periodic review and continuous ordering is highly relevant in practice, as information on the actual inventory level is not always up to date while making ordering decisions. This paper will therefore treat this model. Assuming zero fixed ordering costs, and allowing for a non-negative lead time and a general demand process, we first consider a one-period decision problem without salvage cost for inventory remaining {{at the end of}} the period. In this setting we derive a base-line optimal order path, described by a simple newsvendor solution with safety stocks increasing towards the end of a review period. We then show that for the general, multi-period problem, the optimal policy in a period is to first arrive at this path by not ordering until the <b>excess</b> buffer <b>stock</b> from the previous review period is depleted, then follow the path by continuous ordering, and stop ordering towards the end to limit <b>excess</b> <b>stocks</b> for the next review period. An important managerial insight is that, typically, no order should be placed at a review moment, although this may seem intuitive and is also the standard assumption in periodic review models. We illustrate that adhering to the optimal ordering path instead can lead to cost reductions of 30 - 60 percent compared to pure periodic ordering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact that the {{integration}} of an excess volatility factor has on the asset-pricing performance of the Fama-French (1992, 1993) and of the Carhart (1997) models, {{with reference to the}} retrospective and prospective explanation of the time series and of the cross section of <b>excess</b> returns on <b>stocks.</b> Specifically, the research intends {{to determine whether or not}} a new excess volatility factor is able to capture common sources of <b>excess</b> returns on <b>stocks,</b> related to <b>excess</b> volatility, and left unexplained by the available asset-pricing models. The key motivation behind this research is to put in contact the current multi-index asset-pricing models with the behavioural finance perspectives over the determinants of speculative asset prices fluctuations. According to Shiller (2013) and Wang and Ma (2014) the excess volatility with which speculative asset prices fluctuate through time is explained by the behavioural principle of investors’ overreaction. The constancy with which this phenomenon affected stock prices for more than a hundred years suggests us its likely persistence through time. Hence, asset- pricing models should evaluate its role in explaining <b>stock’s</b> <b>excess</b> returns. The analysis is performed according to Fama and French’s (1993) methodology. The results indicate that the excess volatility factor is a statistically significant determinant of <b>excess</b> returns on <b>stocks,</b> and that its introduction into fundamental multi-index models ameliorates their asset- pricing and predictive performance. The research concludes with a theoretical contextualization of its findings and several examples of their practical implications for the financial industry. ...|$|R
