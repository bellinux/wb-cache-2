Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay {{and take care of}} the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> and he smiles.|$|E
5|$|Mulder discovers a signal, {{possibly}} {{originating from}} an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport {{to fly to}} Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals—the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{remembers that}} an {{anti-virus}} {{is in the}} lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.|$|E

5|$|The police {{discover}} Michael's {{location and}} surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside {{to try to}} reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her {{that no one is}} restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael {{that it is time to}} go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Doors can be hinged so {{that the}} axis of {{rotation}} {{is not in the}} plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This requires a mechanism {{so that the}} axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doors</b> <b>Open</b> Toronto {{relies heavily}} on the support of sponsors. The Toronto Star {{releases}} the official <b>Doors</b> <b>Open</b> Toronto program guide in May of each year {{and has been a}} vital supporter of the program. In 2012, City TV and Omni Television also came on board as <b>Doors</b> <b>Open</b> Toronto media sponsors.|$|R

25|$|Where {{the doorway}} is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah {{so that the}} top slants toward the room into which the <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This is done to {{accommodate}} the variant opinions of Rashi and of his grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, {{as to whether it}} should be placed vertically (Rashi) or horizontally (Rabbeinu Tam), and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) are entering the room. The compromise solution has been suggested by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher.|$|E
25|$|Day {{five of the}} {{proceedings}} saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted to introduce evidence {{that had not been}} shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial. The defense objected vehemently with defense lawyer Peter Althin equating the tactic to something out of the old Perry Mason TV show. “Suddenly, the <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> and in walks an entirely new witness.” The presiding judge stopped the case to deliberate the matter and found in favor of the defense, instructing the prosecution to immediately hand over all material they planned to use.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b>|$|E

25|$|Surrounded by a picket fence, the Mapleton Drive {{house is}} two stories with a first floor kitchen, dining room, {{living room and}} {{adjoining}} patio, and at least three bedrooms on the second floor—one for the boys, one for the parents, and a guest room into which Beaver moves for a night. The cellar is accessible through a diagonal door in the kitchen. A kitchen <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> onto a small side yard, the driveway, and a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
25|$|The esonarthex (or inner narthex) {{is similar}} to the exonarthex, running {{parallel}} to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> into the naos, whilst another door, {{at the southern end of}} the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the prothesis. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.|$|E
25|$|The Dennis Otte Round Barn is 54 feet (16.5 m) in {{diameter}} and stands upon a poured concrete foundation. The barn's main entrance is found in its east quadrant, where it faces due east. The <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> into a central crib which bisects the building. Animal stalls are arranged {{on either side of}} the crib in a semi circular pattern, they are divided with hewn and sawed posts which support a concentric loft plate with a radius of about 27 feet (8.2 m). The single hip roof is supported by a 2 by 6inch (5.1 by 15.2cm) beam nailed to each rafter four feet (1.2 m) above, and four feet (1.2 m) below on the opposite side, the roof hip. This is similar to the nearby Gerald Harbach Round Barn. The wooden shingled roof is capped by a short, squat cupola. The loft plate, the flooring and the loft piers were all constructed from previously used materials.|$|E

In the dream, Hook, Snow White and herself are in the Underworld Graveyard {{attempting}} to use Emma's light magic to erase their names from the tombstones Hades had created. Hook sense something is wrong and a tornado appears. The three seek shelter behind a large crypt and Hook senses {{there is a large}} creature nearby. Snow attempts to face the creature and is taken away and presumably killed which wakes Emma. Emma tells Hook about the dream wondering if they are visions of the future. In the library, Regina has spent all night preparing a spell to break Hades' protection spell on the elevator by drawing runes all over the elevator door. Emma and Regina use their magic to open the door as they break the code and the <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> revealing a brick wall, their efforts proving futile. Emma outlines some of the details of the dream believing that she can erase their names from the tombstones to all everyone to leave the underworld.
