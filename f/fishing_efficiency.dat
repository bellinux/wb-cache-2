Many of the current methods used to fish leads to overfishing and the unintentional killing of fish and other marine life. Irresponsible fishing practices if allowed to persist unabated would lead to a seafood species worldwide crash by 2048 (in a worst-case scenario). [...] It is estimated that worldwide, 90% of large predatory fish species are gone. Of the 230 US fisheries assessed, it was determined that 54 stocks are overfished, 45 are currently undergoing overfishing while the status of a bit over half of the US’s stocks are unknown. These problems are largely {{due to the lack of}} regulation fishing has had in the past. In the 1960s there was complete access to the fish supply.

The {{state of}} {{habitats}} {{is important for}} their productivity, including for stocks of commercial fish. Some fishing methods can damage habitat or give bycatch of species. Destructive fishing gear has sometimes been introduced without awareness of the direct negative impacts on habitat, and without realising the possible negative indirect impacts on the commercial fishery itself. We present a model to investigate destructive fishing practices on general habitat or other species than those of commercial interest, {{when there is a}} biological interaction to the commercially interesting specie. It includes a logistic biomass-model of commercial fish stock and habitat, a non-essential dependence between habitat and fish stock, and Schaefer harvest functions of fishing both on the commercial stock and the habitat. In the conceptual model habitat can also be interpreted as a species. We give an analytical measure of the impact of being ignorant to the destructive effects of new fishing gear, both compared to the use of non-destructive gear and to optimal management with the destructive gear. The use of new fishing gear is often motivated by improved cost-efficiency. For non-destructive fishing this depends only on changes in catch efficiency and unit cost of fishing effort. When there is destructivity and habitat interaction the condition for actual improvement in <b>fishing</b> cost <b>efficiency</b> is more complex.

This study aimed to understand the human and technological factors that define the <b>fishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a semi-industrial fleet operating at the Campeche Bank, Mexico. A stochastic ray frontier was used to evaluate such efficiency. Nine variables were included: days at sea, crew size, vessel length, power-engine, skippers’ experience, skippers’ education, year-season, fishing area and fishing gear. The data from two fishing seasons (2012 and 2014) used in the analysis comes from logbooks of skippers and interviews undertaken in the Yucatan coast. A total of 1, 095 fishing trips were analyzed, the efficiency of the fleet for both year was medium (0. 72 and 0. 62).

40|$|Abstract: Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) {{have long}} been proposed {{as a way of}} increasing the profitability of fisheries by introducing a rights based, tradeable permit system that fosters stewardship of the resource, breaking the cycle of over-capitalisation and over-exploitation. Under ITQs, fishers receive a share of total allowable catch (TAC) and are free to use it or sell it. In this paper we develop a model to simulate trading of fisheries quota in an ITQ market. We build on a multi-species population and vessel dynamics model developed for common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) in the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF), a $AU 50 million fishery operating on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, where an ITQ fisheries management system has been operating since 2004. The model considers initial quota allocation to vessels, seasonal fish prices and individual variable costs, <b>fishing</b> <b>efficiency</b> and experience., Vessel operators can either purchase or sell quota of either species, if it was in their interest to do so to maximise profit.
