5|$|On 26 April 1915, at Wieltje, Belgium, Jemadar Mir Dast led his platoon {{with great}} bravery during the attack, and {{afterwards}} collected various {{parties of the}} regiment (when no British officers were left) and kept them under his command until the retirement was ordered. He also displayed great courage that <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> helped to carry eight British and Indian officers to safety while exposed to heavy fire.|$|E

5|$|Rudraveena is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cult films in the careers of Balachander and Shobana. In an interview with Rediff.com in April 1997, Chiranjeevi stated that he opted to act in Rudraveena for an image makeover. He added that despite its failure, the film made him happy as it had inspired many villages in Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure as the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Chiranjeevi's Eye & Blood Bank (CEBB) in June 2006 and expressed his appreciation for the initiative; the actor recalled the <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ruled out the climax of Rudraveena ever happening in real life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of August 1943, his tally stood at 42, but Hartmann's tally had more than doubled by the end. The Red Army began a counteroffensive {{in the region to}} contain the German {{operation}} and destroy its forces (Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev). JG52 was engaged in defensive operations throughout the month. On 1 August 1943 Hartmann became an ace-in-a day by claiming five victories. Another four followed on 3 August and five on the 4 August. Another five were claimed destroyed on the 5 August, a single on the 6 August, and a further five on 7 August. On 8 and 9 August he claimed another four Soviet fighters. Hartmann's last claim of the month came on 20th <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> accounted for an IL-2 for his 90th victory. The next month, he was appointed Staffelkapitän of 9./JG52.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Colonel Adolf Galland {{recommended}} Gollob for the Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) {{position of}} JG77. Gollob {{was sent to}} the Geschwaderstab of Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG54—54th Fighter Wing) as a commander-in-training under Major Hannes Trautloft. On 1 May 1942, Gollob was officially appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG77, replacing Major Gotthard Handrick. He took operational command of the Geschwader after he arrived on 16 May 1942. On the same day of his arrival, Gollob flew his first combat mission as Geschwaderkommodore. That day, he claimed his aerial victories 87 to 89, shooting down three Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. Gollob's success continued the following <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was credited with three R-5s and one LaGG-3 destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic and {{not knowing what to}} feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not.

Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E

5|$|Astana's Vuelta {{was a quiet}} one. Vinokourov {{placed in}} the top ten of the opening {{individual}} time trial but he {{fell out of the}} top ten of the overall standings the next day due to a crash. Haimar Zubeldia's 18th-place finish on stage 8, which was the Vuelta's first high mountain stage, propelled him into eighth overall until the next <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> lost time and fell to ninth. In stage 10, Vinokourov figured in a winning breakaway, but his poor positioning in the four-man sprint finish meant the stage victory went to 's Simon Gerrans. Before stage 12, Astana held ninth overall. They continued to hold it after the stage, but the rider in that position changed; Zubeldia had been in the top ten, but finished further behind stage winner Ryder Hesjedal than Daniel Navarro, so it was Navarro who was the team's highest-placed rider after the stage. After the next two stages, Navarro also fell from the top ten, and the team did not achieve anything further, with Navarro in 13th their highest-placed rider in the race's final standings.|$|E
5|$|Dorada {{returned}} to New Japan on April 16, teaming with Tama Tonga to defeat Liger and King Fale in a tag team match. Dorada worked {{a majority of}} the tour as a rudo, teaming with members of the Chaos stable. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2011, Dorada unsuccessfully challenged Liger for the CMLL World Middleweight Championship. Dorada's extended tour of New Japan also included participation in the 2011 Best of the Super Juniors tournament in late May-early June. Dorada managed to win four out of his eight matches in the round robin stage of the tournament, which included wins over Liger and CMLL World Welterweight Champion Ryusuke Taguchi, and finished sixth out of the nine wrestlers in his block. On June 18 at New Japan's Dominion 6.18 show, Dorada defeated Taguchi to regain the CMLL World Welterweight Championship. Three days later Dorada entered the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament, teaming with IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and KUSHIDA, with the team defeating Brian Kendrick, Gedo and Jado in their first round match. The following day the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson. Dorada's tour of New Japan ended the following <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he,</b> Tanahashi, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Tiger Mask and Wataru Inoue were defeated in a ten-man tag team match by Chaos (Dick Togo, Gedo, Jado, Masato Tanaka and Yujiro Takahashi).|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought the <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's liberals in {{their opposition to the}} expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, Durant {{made his}} debut for the Warriors in their season opener against the San Antonio Spurs. In 36 minutes of action, he {{recorded}} a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds in a 129–100 loss. Three days later, he recorded 30 points and 17 rebounds (one shy {{of his career}} high) in a 122–114 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. In his third game for Golden State on October 30, he had a 37-point outing in a 106–100 win over the Phoenix Suns. On November 3, he matched his career high with seven three-pointers and scored 39 points in a 122–96 win over his former team, the Thunder. With 22 points against the New Orleans Pelicans on November 7, Durant had at least 20 points for his 71st straight game, matching Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the fifth-longest streak in NBA history. He increased that streak to 72 games with at least 20 points on November 9 against the Mavericks, tying Michael Jordan for the fourth-longest streak ever. The streak ended the following <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored 18 points in a win against the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{strategy of}} Heraclius, {{to destroy the}} Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed these qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmouk, Khalid carried out on a small tactical scale what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale: by rapidly deploying and manoeuvering his forces, Khalid was able to temporarily concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan {{was never able to}} make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the unfavorable terrain that prevented large-scale deployment. However, at no point did Vahan attempt to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive 5 days out of the six, his battle line remained remarkably static. This all stands {{in stark contrast to the}} very successful offensive plan that Khalid carried out on the final <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> reorganised virtually all his cavalry and committed them to a grand manoeuvre that won the battle.|$|E
