40|$|Background: Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are a promising and powerful source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, cell-based therapies, and drug discovery. Many researchers have employed conventional culture techniques using feeder cells to expand hESCs in significant numbers, although feeder-free culture techniques have recently been developed. In regard to stem cell <b>expansion,</b> <b>gap</b> junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought {{to play an important}} role in hESC survival and differentiation. Indeed, it has been reported that hESC-hESC communication through connexin 43 (Cx 43, one of the major gap junctional proteins) is crucial for the maintenance of hESC stemness during expansion. However, the role of GJIC between hESCs and feeder cells is unclear and has not yet been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study therefore examined whether a direct Cx 43 -mediated interaction between hESCs and human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) influences the maintenance of hESC stemness. Over 10 passages, hESCs cultured on a layer of Cx 43 -downregulated hASC feeder cells showed normal morphology, proliferation (colony growth), and stemness, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase (AP), OCT 4 (POU 5 F 1 -Human gene Nomenclature Database), SOX 2, and NANOG expression.

40|$|The ITER {{electron}} cyclotron heating {{transmission lines}} {{will consist of}} 63. 5 -mm-diameter corrugated waveguides, each carrying 1 MW of 170 GHz microwaves. These transmission lines must include expansion units to accommodate expansion and contraction along the path from the gyrotron microwave sources to the tokamak. A numerical mode matching code has been developed to calculate power losses due to mode conversion of the operating mode, HE 11, to higher order modes {{as a result of}} the radial discontinuities in a sliding joint. Two expansion unit designs were evaluated, a simple <b>gap</b> <b>expansion</b> unit and a more complex tapered <b>expansion</b> unit. The <b>gap</b> <b>expansion</b> unit demonstrated loss that oscillated rapidly with expansion length, due to trapped modes within the unit. The tapered expansion unit has been shown to effectively suppress these trapped modes at the expense of increased fabrication complexity. In a <b>gap</b> <b>expansion</b> unit, for a waveguide step size of 2. 5 mm, loss can be kept below 0. 1 % to a maximum expansion length of 17 mm. Expansion units without corrugation on interior walls were also evaluated. Expansion units that lack corrugations are found to increase mode trapping within the units, though not beyond useful application.

40|$|A sharp {{increase}} in unemployment accompanied by a relatively muted response of inflation during the Great Recession cast further doubts on {{the validity of the}} Phillips curve. With the aid of dynamic model averaging (Raftery et al., 2010), this paper aims to highlight that the existence of a systemic relation between real activity and inflation is blurred due to (i) the failure to capture inflationary pressures by means of a single measure of economic activity, and (ii) the existence of a non-linear response of inflation to the driving variable. Based on data for the U. S. and other G 7 countries, our results show that the relation between economic activity and inflation is quite sturdy when one allows for more complex assessment of the former. We find that inflation responds to different measures of economic activity across time and space, and no measure of economic activity clearly dominates. The output gap is often outperformed by unemployment-related variables such as the short-term unemployment rate, the unemployment <b>expansion</b> <b>gap,</b> and the unemployment recession gap. Finally, our results confirm a weakening of the inflation–activity relationship (i. e., a flattening of the Phillips curve) in the last decades, which might be attributed to structural changes in the economy and monetary policy, that is robust both across activity measures and across countries...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{specific}} inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, α-amanitin is broadly used {{to block}} transcriptional activities in cells. Previous {{studies showed that}} α-amanitin affects in vitro maturation of cumulus-oocyte-complex (COC). In this study, we evaluated the target of α-amanitin, and whether it affects oocytes or cumulus cells (CCs), or both. We treated α-amanitin with different time period during in vitro culture of denuded oocytes (DOs) or COCs in comparison, and observed the changes in morphology and maturation status. Although DOs did not show any change in morphology and maturation rates with α-amanitin treatment, oocytes from COCs were arrested at metaphase I (MI) stage and CCs were more scattered than control groups. To discover causes of meiotic arrest and scattering of CCs, we focused on changes of cumulus <b>expansion,</b> <b>gap</b> junctions, and cellular metabolism which to be the important factors for the successful in vitro maturation of COCs. Expression of genes for cumulus expansion markers (Ptx 3, Has 2, and Tnfaip 6) and gap junctional proteins (Gja 1, Gja 4, and Gjc 1) decreased in α-amanitin-treated CCs. However, these changes were not observed in oocytes. In addition, expression of genes related to metabolism (Prps 1, Rpe, Rpia, Taldo 1, and Tkt) decreased in α-amanitin-treated CCs but not in oocytes. Therefore, we concluded that the transcriptional activities of CCs for supporting suitable transcripts, especially for its metabolic activities and formation of gap junctions among CCs {{as well as with}} oocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{operation of}} the `Forest Flyer' type of explosive launching system for shock physics projectiles was investigated in detail using one- and two-dimensional continuum dynamics simulations. The simulations were insensitive to uncertainties in the material properties, and reproduced measurements of the projectile. The most commonly-used variant, with an Al alloy case, was predicted to produce a slightly curved projectile, subjected to some shock heating, and likely exhibiting some porosity from tensile damage. The flatness can be improved by using a case of lower shock impedance, such as polymethyl methacrylate. High-impedance cases, including Al alloys but with denser materials improving the launching efficiency, can be used if designed according to the physics of oblique shock reflection. The tensile stress induced in the projectile depends on the relative thickness of the explosive, <b>expansion</b> <b>gap,</b> and projectile. The thinner the projectile {{with respect to the}} explosive, the smaller the tensile stress. If the explosive is initiated with a plane wave lens, the tensile stress is lower than for initiation with multiple detonators over a plane. The previous plane wave lens designs did however induce a tensile stress close to the spall strength of the projectile. The tensile stress can be reduced by changes in the component thicknesses. Experiments to verify the operation of explosively-launched projectiles should attempt to measure porosity induced in the projectile: arrival time measurements may be insensitive to porous regions caused by damaged or recollected material...|$|E

40|$|During {{processing}} and use polymer components {{are subjected to}} a complex thermal and deformation history. Prediction of the polymer 2 ̆ 7 s response to process conditions and life-time performance requires constitutive models capable of addressing the coupling between thermal history and deformation. The predictive capabilities of a thermoviscoelastic model developed by Caruthers and coworkers (Lustig et al., 1995) via the rational thermodynamics framework which included a material timescale were investigated. The thermoviscoelastic model described quantitatively the Kovacs (1963) volume recovery data for poly(vinyl) acetate using a single set of model parameters, which is a significant improvement over the existing structural relaxation models. The key difference between the thermoviscoelastic model and other models is that the configurational entropy, which controls the viscoelastic timescale, depends {{not only on the}} current temperature and volume but also explicitly depends upon the thermal history, which was found to be critical in predicting the Kovacs 2 ̆ 7 <b>expansion</b> <b>gap.</b> ^ To investigate the coupling between thermal history and viscoelasticity, isothermal and nonisothermal tensile creep experiments were conducted using the epoxy resin Epon 1001 F/DDS. The isothermal creep results were carried out to loading times much greater than the aging time during the thermal pre-treatment. Consequently, significant physical aging effects were observed during creep, which resulted in the failure of time-temperature superposition in the glass. Using the same thermal pre-treatment, the nonisothermal experiments consisted of simultaneously heating while measuring the creep compliance. The nonisothermal creep results were analyzed by a temperature-reduced time, which is the traditional method of analyzing nonisothermal viscoelastic data and implicitly assumes the nonisothermal response can be constructed from a sequence of isothermal viscoelastic responses. For annealing temperatures in the T g region, a discrepancy of approximately half an order of magnitude between the nonisothermal response and the response predicted by the temperature-reduced time was observed. The thermoviscoelastic model successfully described both the isothermal and nonisothermal creep results by accounting for the effect of thermal expansion on the magnitude of the tensile compliance and the effect of evolution of the shift factor during isothermal annealing and heating respectively on the timescale of the compliance. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the influence of temperature changes on integral abutment bridge movements, thirty-two Sokkia RS 30 N reflective targets were strategically attached to a bridge along its length. These targets were surveyed every month for twelve consecutive months. These changes in length coincided with restraint conditions between purely fixed and simply supported. Movement of expansion joints was also recorded. The movements of the <b>expansion</b> <b>gaps</b> at opposite corners appear to exhibit similar movements. This behavior indicates a type of twisting motion occurring within the bridge {{as a result of}} unequal movements at the east and west sides of each abutment. This motion suggests that the bridge abutments experience forces that incite weak axis bending in the abutments, especially in the north abutment. These quantitative bridge movements were compared to predicted behavior from a finite-element model. A detailed finite-element model of the bridge was created using SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc.) software. The detailed model was developed using solid elements for all components of the bridge except piles and bents. Longitudinal surface springs were placed at the abutment elements in order to simulate the soil-abutment interaction. A typical temperature load was assigned to the bridge deck and girder elements to compare the calculated stress concentrations in the model with the observed cracking on the abutment. The model produced high stress concentrations in the abutment adjacent to the bottom girder flange. This corresponded to the same location of observed cracking. The finite-element model also showed lateral movement of the north abutment. This lateral abutment contributed to the unequal movements of the bridge spans. Once the comparison between the measured bridge behavior of the survey and the findings of the detailed finite element model was completed, a simplified model was used to evaluate the bending moment and stresses in the abutment of the 400 South Street Bridge. The simplified model was also used to perform a parametric study on the influence of skew, span length, and temperature gradient on weak-axis abutment moments...|$|R
