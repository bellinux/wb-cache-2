40|$|This paper {{describes}} a machine translation architecture that integrates {{the use of}} examples for flexible, <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translations</b> {{with the use of}} linguistic rules for broad coverage and grammatical accuracy. We have implemented a prototype for English-to-Japanese translation, and our evaluation shows that the system has good translation quality, and only requires reasonable computational resources. 1 Introduction Machine translation by analogy to pairs of corresponding expressions in the source and target languages, or "example-based translation", was first proposed by (Nagao 1984). Recent work in the example-based framework includes memory-based translation (Sato & Nagao 1990), similarity-driven translation (Watanabe 1992), transfer-driven machine translation (Furuse & Iida 1996), and pattern-based machine translation (Watanabe & Takeda 1998). The example-based approach promises easy translation knowledge acquisition, more flexible transfer than brittle rule-based approach [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} the study where 173 English onomastic phraseological units (PUs) were classified according to their translations into Slovene. Four groups were identified. More than 61 % of all PUs belong to the group where the translation equivalent is either descriptive or represented by a one-word equivalent. This group is followed by two groups amounting to 18. 50 %, i. e., a group where the English PU is translated idiomatically with a proper name and a group where it is translated idiomatically with the same proper name. The smallest group where the English PU is translated by means of a different proper name amounts to less than 2 %. It is evident that non-idiomatic descriptive translation or one-word equivalents exceed <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translations</b> of any kind, and that the majority of PUs in both languages are highly culture-specific, thus posing problems to non-native speakers in comprehension and translation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} problems and provide solutions for improving Chinese to English translation quality, including ways to avoid Chinglish. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used, including interviews of 20 faculty members and a survey of over 300 students at 7 universities in China. The study researched four problem areas: Chinglish, cultural awareness, machine translation (MT), and translation profession. The results indicated that causes for Chinglish stem from different levels including vocabulary, syntax, and cultural levels. Cultural awareness was found to be a key factor for improving translation quality, especially when it comes to <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translations.</b> MT is best when used for gisting, which means a rough translation of the source text that allows the reader to understand the essence or general meaning of the source text even though the sentence structure, grammatical agreement, parts of speech, or word meanings are not accurate. Finally, it was found there is a need to train more competent translators. Solving these problems will improve the quality of Chinese to English translation...|$|R
50|$|When a {{translator}} segments a text into translation units, the larger these units are, the better chance {{there is of}} obtaining an <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translation.</b> This is true not only of human translation, but also in cases where human translators use computer-assisted translation, such as translation memories, and also when translations are performed by machine translation systems.|$|E

50|$|A {{consistent}} exegetical {{procedure is}} evident in manuscripts in which the original Avestan and its zand coexist. The priestly scholars first translated the Avestan as literally as possible. In a second step, the priests then translated the Avestan idiomatically. In the final step, the <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translation</b> was complemented with explanations and commentaries, often of significant length, and occasionally with different authorities being cited.|$|E
40|$|The {{translation}} of electronic contracts {{in which the}} applicable law is the target culture's one, either because there's a specific law or rule that protects the consumer or because a specific clause in the contract says so, presents a new paradigm in the {{translation of}} contracts—the instrumental translation in the legal domain. The theoretical framework developed by Christiane Nord, where she makes the distinction between instrumental and documentary translation, was of little practical application to the translation of contracts, since {{in most cases the}} translation of contracts is documentary. However, this new situation makes it necessary to re-examine the method and techniques that are most appropriate for the translation of contracts to which the applicable law is that of the target culture. In this article we describe the factors involved in the transfer of legal concepts, we examine the main approaches to solve terminological problems and we call the attention towards an aspect of translation that is often ‘left behind’ in the automatic or semiautomatic processes of translation and yet is essential for the target text to be a good quality translation: the need to make <b>idiomatic</b> <b>translations...</b>|$|R
30|$|The English version cited {{throughout}} {{the present study}} is the New Jewish Publication Society (NJPS, 1985) translation. The text has been edited in order to remove narrative elements surrounding the quoted dialogues, to shorten the dialogues or individual turns by eliminating, for example, bound clauses not relevant to the analysis, and finally to change <b>idiomatic</b> English <b>translations</b> where they obscure the grammatical point under discussion. The transliteration system used for the examples is the Brill Scholarly transliteration of biblical Hebrew, version 0.4, 9 July 2015, by Pim Rietbroek.|$|R
2500|$|In 1985, Bowles {{published}} his translation of Jorge Luis Borges' short story, [...] "The Circular Ruins". It was {{collected in a}} book of 16 stories, all translated by Bowles, called She Woke Me Up So I Killed Her. This Borges story had previously been published in translations by the three main Borges translators: Anthony Kerrigan, Anthony Bonner, and James E. Irby. Critics have noted the differences amongst these four translations. Bowles' version is in his typical prose style; it is readily distinguishable from the other three, which have a more conservative <b>idiomatic</b> form of <b>translation.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these concepts, in 1990, Brian Mossop presented his concept of idiomatic and unidiomatic translation. <b>Idiomatic</b> <b>translation</b> is when {{the message of the}} source text is conveyed the way a target language writer would convey it, rather than staying {{to the way in which}} it was conveyed in the source text. Unidiomatic translation is innovative and translates individual words.|$|E

40|$|Keyword : <b>Translation,</b> <b>Idiomatic</b> Expressions, Idiom <b>Translation</b> Strategy Extensive {{research}} has been done in the field of translation strategies. However, in conducting a translation, theorists suggest strategies representing their individual perspective may be different one another. Most theorists agree that strategies are necessary when translator faced a problem which literal translation cannot solve. The present study made an effort to analyze the object, using the BakerÂ’s (2011) classification of translation strategies. The study focused on analyzing the translation strategies used in translating Sherlock HolmesÂ’ idiomatic expressions in the film Sherlock Holmes (2009) directed by Guy Ritchie. This study is aimed at identifying (1) idioms used by Sherlock Homes, (2) the meaning of the idioms, and (3) and the strategies used in the film Sherlock Holmes. This study is a qualitative research using descriptive research design. The data of this study were idiomatic expressions found in the film Sherlock Holmes, its meaning, and the strategy used in translating them. The present study focused mainly on idiomatic expressions used by the character of Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, the main instrument used in collecting the data in this study was the researcher himself. The finding of this study shows that there were some expressions used by Sherlock Homes considered as idiomatic expressions. The idioms represented their meaning different from their literal meaning and translated based on its context. Moreover, based on the idiom translation strategy, there were strategies applied by the translator in translating the idioms into target language (TL), they included: (1) translation by using an idiom with similar meaning but dissimilar form, (2) translation by paraphrase, and (3) translation by omission...|$|R
40|$|Using Standard Arabic {{original}} {{texts and}} <b>idiomatic</b> English <b>translations,</b> this paper considers syntactic, discoursal and denotative {{similarities and differences}} between English and Arabic in respect of junction. In order to define the basic analytical scope, a composite definition of 'sentence' is developed, integrating grammatical, semantic and punctuational/intonational criteria. It is argued for both English and Arabic that the adjunction-disjunction distinction is properly syntactic, but that disjunction-coordination is perhaps better understood as a semantic cline. The relationship between thematic structure, mainness-subordination and grounding is investigated. While English typically backgrounds rhematic subordinate clauses, with disjuncts more likely to be foregrounded than adjuncts, Arabic readily allows foregrounding of rhematic subordinate clauses. The Arabic disjuncts {A figure is presented} ('id) and {A figure is presented} (under(h, ̇) a y under(t, _)) 'since, as' may display discoursal independence beyond that possible for a foregrounded subordinate disjunct rheme in English. While English standardly requires both main coordinate clauses to be foregrounded, Arabic allows either clause to be foregrounded or backgrounded. Denotative differences are illustrated by the greater capacity of Arabic adjunct-heads {A figure is presented} (under(h, ̇) a t t a a) and {A figure is presented} (ila 'an) 'until' for denotative independence from their main clause than English 'until'. Discoursal and denotative factors may interact to produce Arabic coordinate-clause types which are strikingly unlike English ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} is an entitled “An Analysis of The <b>Translation</b> of The <b>Idiomatic</b> Expressions Used in The Subtitles of Tangled”. The {{aims of the}} research are to find out Idiom expression. Idioms are the gems of a language, they {{can be considered as}} a part of everyday language. They are essence of any language and the most problematic part to handle with. Translating English idioms is not an easy task because not all English idioms have equivalents in Indonesian idioms due to linguistic, especially cultural differences. The objectives of this study are to find out the types of idiomatic expressions which are found in the film entitled Tangled and to know whether there is any misinterpretation resulting in incorrect <b>translation</b> of <b>idiomatic</b> expressions in the scrip of Tangled. The theory that writer uses is some of Vinay and Darbelnet seven translation method, those are Borrowing, Literal, Modulation and Equivalence. The writer uses qualitative approach in order to answer the research question. The finding in this study found that the idioms in Tangled movie are Colloquialism consists of 15 idioms, Proverb consists of two idioms, Slang consists of three idioms, Allusion consists of three idioms, and Phrasal verb consists three idioms. Therefore, some of the idioms expression that used in the subtitle of Tangled are misinterpreted. Keyword: <b>Idiomatic</b> Expression, <b>Translation,</b> Tangle...|$|R
