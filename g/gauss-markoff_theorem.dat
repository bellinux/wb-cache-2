40|$|A semiblind {{iterative}} algorithm {{to construct}} the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) of the channel impulse response (CIR) vector h for communication systems that utilize a periodically transmitted training sequence within a continuous stream of information symbols is devised. The BLUE CIR estimate for the general linear model y = Ah + w, where w is the correlated noise, is given by the <b>Gauss-Markoff</b> <b>theorem.</b> The covariance matrix of the correlated noise, which is denoted by C(h), {{is a function of}} the channel that is to be identified. Consequently, an iteration is used to give successive approximations h(k), k = 0, 1, 2, [...] . to hBLUE, where h(0) is an initial approximation given by the correlation processing, which exists at the receiver for the purpose of frame synchronization. A function F(h) for which hBLUE is a fixed point is defined. Conditions under which hBLUE is the unique fixed point and for which the iteration proposed in the algorithm converges to the unique fixed point hBLUE are given. The proofs of these results follow broadly along the lines of Banach fixed-point theorems...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, I {{develop a}} general {{theoretical}} framework {{for addressing the}} data regularization problem. The problem fundamentals are traced back to statistical estimation theory. Following Claerbout (1992, 1999), I formulate data regularization as a simple linear-estimation problem. STATISTICAL ESTIMATION Let d be the vector of observed data, and m be the ideal underlying model. The regularized data represent the model estimate . Taking into account {{the lack of information}} about m, we can treat both m and d as random vectors and approach the problem of finding statistically. For any two random vectors x and y, let us denote by Cxy the mathematical expectation of the random matrix xyT, where yT denotes the adjoint of y. Analogously, Cx will denote the mathematical expectation of xxT. For zero-mean vectors, the matrices Cx and Cxy correspond to covariances. In a more general case, they are second-moment statistics of the corresponding random processes. Applying the <b>Gauss-Markoff</b> <b>theorem,</b> one can obtain an explicit form of the estimate under three very general assumptions (Liebelt, 1967) ...|$|E
40|$|Conference Record of the Thirty-Eighth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers; Pacific Grove, CA; United States; 7 November 2004 through 10 November 2004 We {{present a}} low {{complexity}} approximate method for semi-blind best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) of a channel impulse response vector (CIR) for a communication system which utilizes a periodically transmitted training sequence, within a continuous stream of information symbols. The algorithm achieves slightly degraded results {{at a much}} lower complexity than directly computing the BLUE CIR estimate. In addition, the inverse matrix required to invert the weighted normal equations to solve the general least squares problem may be precomputed and stored at the receiver. The BLUE estimate is obtained by solving the general linear model, y = Ah + w + n, for h, where w is correlated noise and the vector n is an AWGN process, which is uncorrelated with w. The solution is given by the <b>Gauss-Markoff</b> <b>Theorem</b> as h = (A TC(h) - 1 A) - 1 A TC(h) - 1 y. In the present work we propose a Taylor series approximation for the function F(h) = (A TC(h) - 1 A) - 1 A TC(h) - 1 y where, F: R L → R L for each fixed vector of received symbols, y, and each fixed convolution matrix of known transmitted training symbols, A. We describe the full Taylor formula for this function, F (h) = F (h id + ∑ |α|≥ 1 (h - h id) α (∂/∂h) α F(h id) and describe algorithms using, respectively, first, second and third order approximations. The algorithms give better performance than correlation channel estimates and previous approximations used at only a slight increase in complexity. The linearization procedure used is similar to that used in the linearization to obtain the extended Kalman filter, and the higher order approximations are similar to those used in obtaining higher order Kalman filter approximations...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn a computer simulation experiment, acoustic tomography is assessed {{as a means}} of measuring the seasonal flux of heat advected by the Norwegian Atlantic Current. Oceanic heat flux has traditionally been measured by various direct or indirect techniques that are prone to error or large uncertainty. The tomographic technique offers distinct advantages over conventional methods in that temperature and current fields, that combine to yield heat flux in the ocean, can be determined at various spatial and temporal scales. The adequacy of the tomographic technique thus hinges on the question of how well can the temperature and current by resolved spatially? The spatial resolution of tomography varies with array size, number of transceivers used and the characteristics of the sound channel. In the assessment we use the General Digital Environmental Model (GDEM), a climatological data base, to simulate an ocean area 550 x 550 km squared off the Norwegian Coast. Resolution and variance analysis are performed on two circular arrays consisting of six transceivers. An important finding is that the horizontal resolution lengths of the current and temperature fields differ. For a six element array the horizontal resolution length is approximately one fifth the array diameter for the current field, whereas for the temperature field it is one sixth the array diameter. We then generate synthetic travel time data that have embedded within them temperature and current signals as well as random noise. We invert the synthetic travel time data to form estimates of the original fields using a linear optimal estimator based on the <b>Gauss-Markoff</b> <b>theorem.</b> We relate the sound speed perturbation field to potential temperature and compare these estimates to the original values. Finally we use the estimated fields to compute heat flux across a transect located within the array. We compare the actual to the estimated heat flux to asses the quality of the tomographically derived value. We have found that the quality of the heat flux estimates depends critically on how well the flow field is resolved. A six element array can adequately resolve the current in the Norwegian Sea, provided that its diameter is shorter than 250 km. Such an array is able to measure net heat flux through a transect {{at the center of the}} array with only a 10 % error. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
