40|$|The {{growth of}} high speed {{computing}} devices and Internet has made the Data communication very easy and fast. But this advancement has also increased the chances of getting the data snooped {{at the time of}} sending and receiving messages over network. So that Information has to be secured. In this paper, we proposed a method that uses Steganography. Steganography is a way of hiding secret information into a file (or any other thing that is convertible to Digital Format) and send it to the other end without being noticed. Proposed method takes Video as a carrier file and all the information is stored within that video file (that is called Video Steganography). The proposed method is based on Pixel Value Extraction of RGB model which uses Least Significant Bit insertion technique to <b>insert</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> within the Video file. Here the secret data is inserted into video frames after applying some checks onto it, related to its imperceptibility and capacity. In this paper we also have done some kind of Quantitative Analysis on different types of data. The result is evaluated in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE), that is, the output video file is compared to the original file, and we find minimal degradation that is quite imperceptible. Finally, we have some comparison drawn between some old methods with this new one...|$|E
40|$|Background: Interfacing of {{clinical}} laboratory instruments with the laboratory information system (LIS) via "middleware" software is increasingly common. Our clinical laboratory implemented capillary electrophoresis using a Sebia; Capillarys- 2 ™ (Norcross, GA, USA) instrument for serum and urine protein electrophoresis. Using Data Innovations Instrument Manager, an interface was established with the LIS (Cerner) that allowed for bi-directional transmission of numeric data. However, {{the text of}} the interpretive pathology report was not properly transferred. To reduce manual effort and possibility for error in text data transfer, we developed scripts in AutoHotkey, a free, open-source macro-creation and automation software utility. Materials and Methods: Scripts were written to create macros that automated mouse and key strokes. The scripts retrieve the specimen accession number, capture user input text, and <b>insert</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> interpretation in the correct patient record in the desired format. Results: The scripts accurately and precisely transfer narrative interpretation into the LIS. Combined with bar-code reading by the electrophoresis instrument, the scripts transfer data efficiently to the correct patient record. In addition, the AutoHotKey script automated repetitive key strokes required for manual entry into the LIS, making protein electrophoresis sign-out easier to learn and faster to use by the pathology residents. Scripts allow for either preliminary verification by residents or final sign-out by the attending pathologist. Conclusions: Using the open-source AutoHotKey software, we successfully improved the transfer of text data between capillary electrophoresis software and the LIS. The use of open-source software tools should not be overlooked as tools to improve interfacing of laboratory instruments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} data-hiding {{technique}} for water marked images and secured transmission of those watermarked images to the destination. today’s {{lot of companies}} are stored their data in the images, they store data with their ownership. To achieve blind watermark extraction, {{it is difficult to}} use the detail coefficients directly as a location map to determine the data-hiding locations. Hence, we view flipping an edge pixel in binary images as shifting the edge location one pixel horizontally and vertically. Based on this we propose an morphological binary wavelet transform to track the shifted edges, which thus facilitates blind watermark extraction with support of cryptographic concepts. In existing block-based approach, in which the block size is taken as 3 * 3 pixels or larger,and then we <b>insert</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> into that particular blocks and they are using morphological binary wavelet transform. now we propose an alternative approach to the above approach i. e we process an image in 2 * 2 pixel blocks. This gives high security when compared to existing approach. This allows flexibility in tracking the edges and also achieves low computational complexity. The two processing cases that flipping the candidates of one does not affect the flippability conditions of another are employed for orthogonal embedding, which means when ever we are embedded some text into the image the nieghbour pixels are not effected. A novel effective Backward-Forward Minimization method is proposed, which considers both back-wardly those neighboring processed embeddable candidates and forwardly those unprocessed flippable candidates that may be affected by flipping the current pixel. In this way, the total visual distortion can be minimized...|$|E
