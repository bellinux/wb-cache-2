50|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the 500 cc championship {{at the end}} of 1992, Gardner turned his interests to four-wheeled motorsport. He began his touring car career in 1992, driving the Raider Motorsport built Bob Forbes Racing Holden VN Commodore SS Group A, leased by Graham Moore for the 1992 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst. The Moore/Gardner Commodore finished the crash shortened race in 26th place after qualifying 21st. Gardner's first drive in the race happened to be soon after the circuit was hit by rain which lasted for almost two hours, and his cause was not helped by the Commodore's windscreen <b>de-mister</b> not working which saw the screen fog up making visibility, already poor due to the heavy rain and fog on The Mountain, almost impossible.|$|E
