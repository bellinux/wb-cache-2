5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, it employs cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty, without any <b>formal</b> <b>ending.</b>|$|E
500|$|The song's musical key is A. Its {{structure}} comprises two verses, {{a middle}} eight (or bridge) section, an instrumental passage (over the verse melody), {{followed by a}} final verse that leads into a coda (or outro) and a <b>formal</b> <b>ending.</b> In his commentary on [...] "Piggies", musicologist Alan Pollack remarks on its abundance of classical music traits. These {{include the use of}} [...] "arpeggio fragments" [...] in Harrison's opening guitar motif and the repetition of this four-bar passage before each verse and the bridge – a device typical of Schubert's various lieder and the works of other nineteenth-century composers. During the song, the expected cycle of fifth notes in the major scale is interrupted through the inclusion of a III7 (C7) chord, which first appears {{at the end of the}} passage leading into the middle eight, before the melody drops down a tone to the minor ii (Bm) chord. The same section's first line ends with the surprise inclusion of a blues-based riff, soon after which the C7 chord is used again in the ascent to the IV (subdominant) chord, helping to accentuate the phrase [...] "damn good whacking".|$|E

2500|$|Moderating Skills makes a {{group leader}} {{understand}} and regulate the unofficial roles assumed {{by all the}} group members during the discussion and use the members to help solve group problems. For example, {{the role of the}} [...] "tension reducer" [...] is to help the members to resolve conflicts and differences in order to reduce anxiety, while the [...] "task master" [...] helps the members to focus [...] on the purpose of the meeting. Group moderators must be mentally alert, listen well, and think quickly in order to have an effective group discussion. All the questions must be memorized and handy for the leader. Concluding the focus group is necessary for the focus group leader {{in order to get a}} <b>formal</b> <b>ending</b> of the session. The leader must thank the group members for participating in the session and summarize what was discussed during the session. S/he should ask if something was missed out in the summary of the session. This helps the group members to have an exact idea of what happened in the session and have something to take along.|$|E
2500|$|Pause and probe is {{the skill}} of the {{moderator}} to give each participant a chance to jump in. As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would you explain that further?" [...] or [...] "Would you give me an example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list and phone numbers), only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have <b>formal</b> <b>ending),</b> bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E

2500|$|Noting the {{juxtaposition}} of the two terms [...] "Tabernacle" [...] ( [...] , Mishkan) and [...] "Tent of Meeting" [...] ( [...] , Ohel Mo’ed) in [...] the mid-20th-century Italian-Israeli scholar Umberto Cassuto, formerly of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, wrote that the two synonymous expressions stand in juxtaposition to stress the formal solemnity of the statement of the <b>formal</b> <b>ending</b> of {{the account of the}} Tabernacle’s construction. Professor Nahum Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the combination of the two distinct terms for the sanctuary together expresses its dual function as the symbol of the indwelling of the Divine Presence in the camp of Israel and as the site of communication between God and Moses. The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut concluded that the two terms probably reflect two traditions, one using the term [...] "Tabernacle" [...] ( [...] , Mishkan) and the other the term [...] "Tent" [...] ( [...] , Ohel). Plaut reported that the school of Julius Wellhausen considered the [...] "Tent" [...] tradition the older and the [...] "Tabernacle" [...] passages as retrojections of the Priestly source and therefore as largely unhistorical. Plaut reported that another theory assigned the Ark and Tabernacle to a northern and the Tent of Meeting to a southern source and held that David, by putting the Ark into the Tent in [...] united the tribes and traditions and that thereafter the term [...] "Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting" ...|$|E
