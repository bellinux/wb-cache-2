40|$|Abrasive {{waterjet}} (AWJ) cutting is a {{machining process}} to cut {{wide range of}} materials from soft materials such as rubber, leather to hard materials such as metals {{by means of a}} high-velocity slurry jet, formed as a result of injecting abrasive particles into a waterjet. The machining action is the result of these particles impacting against a workpiece with a high velocity. Conventional AWJ equipments generate water pressures up to 400 MPa (= 4000 bar = 58000 psi) and use orifices whose diameters are in the range of 0. 08 mm to 1 mm to generate plain waterjet. The abrasive particles of sizes 0. 07 mm to 0. 36 mm in diameter entrain to the jet former with air and mix with the waterjet in the mixing chamber to form the three phase slurry jet. The abrasive particles are accelerated and focused in the focusing tube. The width of the focusing tube determines the cutting width which is in the range of 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in diameter. This study investigates the applicability and the performance of waterjet (WJ) and AWJcutting process beyond 400 MPa water pressure, which is called ultra-high pressures during the study. One of the objectives is to expand the application domain of the process. With higher water pressure, plain WJ is capable of cutting harder materials and it is possible to cut intricate details with AWJ due to the availability of high energy density with small orifices. Moreover, reduction in cutting costs is expected as a result of higher feed speeds or reduced abrasive consumption. The initial focus of the research is to provide guidelines to develop a reliable AWJ cutting system above 400 MPa. It was shown that the plastic deformation takes place at the thick walled cylinders subjected to internal pressure of more than 700 MPa with the current types of materials that are generally used in high pressure components. Therefore, imposing compressive residual stress to the bore of the cylinder is necessary for the parts such as high pressure intensifier cylinder where plastic deformation is unacceptable. Autofrettage and multi layer construction are the two techniques to create residual stresses in the cylinder. An optimum autofrettage pressure exists due to the Bauschinger effect. Therefore, a multi layer cylinder construction provides cylinders with higher pressure capacity. A simplified model for predicting the pressure output for double acting pressure intensifiers is presented after the design considerations for thick walled cylinders in order to estimate the required attenuator volume and the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> dimensions to limit the pressure fluctuations. The model is in good agreement with the pressure measurements. The energy conversions and the related efficiencies during the AWJ formation process provide a perspective to the performance of the process. Energy density of the plain and abrasive waterjet is defined to correlate with the cutting performance. Reducing the focusing tube diameter and increasing the water pressure are the most beneficial methods to increase the energy density. Other methods such as increasing the orifice diameter or reducing the feed speed are in conflict with cutting intricate details and economical considerations. With the insight gained at the previous step, the performances of plain and abrasive waterjet are evaluated. The increase in pressure results in a more scattered jet. A diverted jet generates wider cuts with wider damaged zones and rounded edges in WJ cutting. In AWJ cutting, it accelerates the wear of the entry region of the focusing nozzle. The experiments show that the length and diameter of upstream tube {{play an important role in}} jet quality. The turbulences in the flow are reduced in the upstream tube. It should be sufficiently large to make the flow laminar. Moreover, when the streamlines are guided towards the orifice with a conical seal, the resultant jet disintegrates later. After the quality of the jet is ensured, the cutting performance tests are conducted. The maximum feed rate increases more than the hydraulic power of the waterjet which shows that increasing the pressure leads to a more power efficient process. Moreover, at the same hydraulic power, the smaller jets perform better. On the other hand, the increase in depth of cut with pressure is directly proportional with the hydraulic power. It is proposed that the depth of cut is directly proportional with the energy density of the jet. However, at the low feed rates the relation is no longer linear. Therefore, the feed rate term of the energy density equation is modified to predict the depth of cut. Due to the cutting mechanism of the plain waterjet, the surface quality is poor with burrs in the case of metals and fiber damages in the case of composite materials. Therefore, plain waterjet cutting is suitable for separating instead of precision cutting of metal sheets and composites. The mixing and acceleration of the particles with a waterjet determine the cutting ability of AWJ. It becomes less efficient at high abrasive loads. The momentum from the plain waterjet to the abrasives transfers more efficient with the increase in pressure at the same abrasive load ratio. The efficiency of power transferred from the water to the abrasives decreases when the abrasive load ratio exceeds 0. 3 for low focusing tube to orifice diameter (df / do) ratios and 0. 4 for high df /do ratio. The optimum abrasive flow rate does not depend on pressure. As it was in the plain waterjet, the energy density of the jet correlates well with the cutting ability of the jet. The linear relation between these parameters becomes non-linear at high energy densities due to the increased energy losses at longer traveling lengths through the material at higher depths of cut. The final consideration of this study is the economical aspects of ultra-high pressure AWJ cutting. The cost advantage depends on the increase of the cost of the pump, the maintenance and the life of the consumables with the pressure increase. The pressure increase is cost effective if the investment costs and maintenance costs are below certain values. If several engineering issues such as the lifetimes of the critical components and the availability of wear resistant sufficiently long focusing tubes are solved, the ultra-high abrasive waterjet cutting can be implemented successfully to industrial applications.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} of using underground coal gasification with a low CO 2 footprint. The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, by using the concept of exergy, a framework was constructed through which the practicality (feasibility) of an energy conversion/extraction method can be systematically evaluated. This framework, based on exergy analysis and cumulative degree of perfection, is described by analyzing a low emission underground coal gasification (UCG) process. For the evaluation of energy conversion processes we introduce a new concept, viz. recovery factor, which is a better indicator of the exergetic viability of a conversion process than the traditionally used efficiency factors. In the second part, various issues related to the aquifer storage of CO 2 are studied. Aquifer storage is considered as an option for low emission fossil fuel utilization. Each chapter is summarized as follows: In chapter 2, various options are considered to reduce CO 2 emissions when utilizing deep coal by applying UCG, i. e., (1) in combination with carbonation of synthetic minerals (CaO), (2) conventional UCG followed by ex-situ separation of CO 2 and (3) upgrading the product gas using naturally occurring minerals (wollastonite). A chemical equilibrium model was used to analyze the effect of the process parameters on product composition and use it for an exergy (useful energy) analysis. The result is presented in terms of theoretical (ideal unit operations), practical (state of the art technology), and zero-emission (applying current CO 2 capture and sequestration (CCS) to all sources of CO 2 emission) recovery factors. The results show that underground gasification of deep coal can optimally extract 52 - 68 % of the coal chemical exergy, but zero-emission extraction gives a negative recovery factor, indicating that it is not practical with {{the current state of the}} art CCS technology. Using in-situ CaO, which will enhance the H 2 production, is theoretically feasible with a recovery factor around 80 %, but is not exergetically feasible with the current state of technology, i. e. with a negative practical recovery factor. Ex-situ upgrading of the conventional UCG product gas with wollastonite is exergetically feasible for both practical and zero-emission cases according to the equilibrium model. Slow attainment of chemical equilibrium makes its application questionable. In chapter 3, based on recent successful low-pressure underground coal gasification pilot experiments that use alternating injection of air (oxygen) and steam, a mathematical model is written to evaluate the potential of alternating injection UCG in large scale hydrogen production. This chapter extends an existing steady state model to a transient model that can describe an alternating injection of air and steam for deep thin coal layers. The model includes transient heat conduction, where the produced heat during the air injection stage is stored in the coal and surrounding strata. The stored heat is subsequently used in the endothermic gasification reactions during the steam injection. Comparison of the results with field data show that product composition and temperature oscillation can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy. The stored heat can deliver additional energy that can maintain the gasification during the steam injection period for a limited time. During the steam injection cycle, at low pressure the volumetric flow and the hydrogen content of the product gas are both high, but at higher pressures while the hydrogen composition is still high, the coal conversion rate decreases considerably. The exergy analysis confirms that alternating injection of air/steam describes a practical process for UCG at low pressure. However, injection of a mixture of steam and oxygen results in a practical recovery factor of 50 % and produces 0. 15 kg CO 2 per MJ of exergy, which is higher than the practical recovery factor (40 %) of the alternating injection process, which produces 0. 12 kg CO 2 / MJ of exergy. In the second part of the thesis, two issues related to aquifer storage of CO 2 are discussed: injectivity problems due to salt precipitation, and storage capacity and long term storage due to dissolution of CO 2 in water. In chapter 4, the negative saturation (NegSat) method, which is a combination of negative flash and multicomponent single/two-phase flow in porous media, is studied. It has been shown to be beneficial in numerical simulations of phase appearance/disappearance for mixtures that consist of volatile components, i. e., components that appear in both liquid and gas phases. The method is extended to a three phase system of CO 2 -water-NaCl, in which NaCl appears as a nonvolatile dissolved component (NaCl) and as an immobile precipitated solid phase. The extended method is of practical use to assess carbon dioxide storage options. A detailed thermodynamic analysis of the NegSat method is given and the possibility to extend it to injection in brine aquifers is demonstrated. Precipitation of salt occurs due to evaporation of water into supercritical CO 2. Precipitation decreases the permeability near the injection well forming a dried-out zone. With the ensuing permeability change, the injection pressure needs to be increased to maintain the CO 2 injection rate, which requires more compression energy and hence influences the exergetic viability of the carbon dioxide sequestration process [...] To address this issue, first a thermodynamic model is optimized to predict the phase behavior of the CO 2 -water-NaCl system with reasonable accuracy. Then the NegSat method for two-phase flow is modified to include salt precipitation. The model is solved to analyze the effect of various physical parameters on the injectivity of CO 2. Finally an exergy analysis is performed to quantify the effect of salt precipitation on the compression power requirement for CO 2 injection into high pressure-high temperature-high salinity aquifers. Exergetic applicability of carbon capture and sequestration for low emission carbon dioxide fuel consumption, can presently only be achieved if the energy-intensive step of nitrogen-CO 2 separation prior to injection can be avoided. In chapter 5, the enhanced mass transfer of CO 2 in water for a CO 2 saturated layer on top of a water saturated porous medium is studied experimentally and theoretically. Dissolution of carbon dioxide in water has a large effect on the capacity of an aquifer for carbon dioxide storage. Without the dissolution effect the storage capacity of aquifers is low. A <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a length of 0. 5 m and a diameter of 0. 15 m is used in pressure decay experiments. The relatively large size of the vessel minimizes the pressure measurement errors that can happen due to temperature fluctuations and small leakages. The experimental results were compared to the theoretical result in terms of onset time of natural convection and rate of mass transfer of CO 2 in the convection dominated process. In addition a non-isothermal multicomponent flow model in porous media is solved numerically to study the effect of the heat of dissolution of CO 2 in water on the rate of mass transfer of CO 2. The effect of the capillary transition zone on the rate of mass transfer of CO 2 is also studied theoretically. The simulation results including the effect of the capillary transition zone show a better agreement with experimental results compared to the simulation result without considering a capillary transition zone. The simulation results also show that the effect of heat of dissolution on the rate of mass transfer is negligible. The overall conclusion is that, for the current state of technology, use of underground coal gasification with a similar carbon foot print as the use of natural gas is not possible. It is to be expected that technological developments will make it possible in the future to use coal with a low carbon footprint. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
