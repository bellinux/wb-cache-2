With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> 9,500 to 14,000; however, that <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming Line 4 Sheppard line.|$|E

At the beginning of the campaign, North Vietnam possessed approximately 1,500 anti-aircraft weapons, most of which were of the light 37 and 57mm variety. Within one year, however, the U.S. estimated that the number had grown to over 5,000 guns, including 85 and 100mm radar-directed weapons. That <b>estimate</b> <b>was</b> later revised downward from a high of 7,000 in early 1967 to less than a thousand by 1972.

Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård.

There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
