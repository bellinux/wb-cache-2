40|$|Abstract: Modular {{modeling}} methods {{based on}} the reasonable simplifying and supposing of hydraulic system of <b>demolishing</b> robots are proposed in this paper, dynamic mathematical model of each hydraulic element of <b>demolishing</b> robots is {{set up by the}} dynamic system analysis software package Simulink of Matlab, response characteristic curve is obtained by the simulation, and analysis of the simulation results is operated in this paper. The experimental results explicate that the hydraulic system is stably, real-time, low-cost, and easy to expand; it can meet the applying requirements of <b>demolishing</b> robots, and it provides the theory basis for the project applying of the hydraulic system of <b>demolishing</b> robots...|$|R
