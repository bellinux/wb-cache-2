40|$|This {{document}} {{gives an}} overview of the challenges and issues related to a sustainable use of steel in the construction sector. After an introduction that concerns the challenges associated to the use of steel as a sustainable material, the principles of a life-cycle analysis are presented. The paper then focuses on the life-cycle inventory data of several products: finished cold-rolled coil, <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel, section rolling and rebar. The data are presented for two (sometimes three) different recycling rates. Indeed, since steel is recycled to more than 85 % {{at the end of its}} life and recyclable and indefinite number of times, the presented inventory includes allocation for scrap inputs and outputs using the closed material loop recycling methodology developed by the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI). A description of the method principles is also provided. The influence of the end-of-life credit method will be discussed. Corrosion and subsequently maintenance of steel products will be treated afterwards and a brief comparison of the life-cycle inventory will be provided for <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel and finished steel...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of CeO 2 and ZrO 2 {{nanoparticles}} on the corrosion protection performance of non-inhibited and cerium inhibited silane coatings in 3. 5 % and 5 % NaCl solutions on <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel substrates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) results show relatively uniform coating thickness and varying nanoparticle distribution depending on coating composition. The corrosion behaviour of the sol–gel coatings revealed that CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles reinforce the barrier properties of the silane films and seem to act as nano-reservoirs providing a prolonged release of cerium ions. This prolonged release of inhibitor from oxide nanoreservoirs confers longer protection to the metallic substrate...|$|R

The excellent properties of the IrO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 /Ti electrode such as a high catalytic activity and a high durability [1, 2] have driven further applications. New applications of the IrO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 /Ti electrode as an oxygen evolution anode in acidic aqueous solutions have included copper foil production and are expected in the electrowinning processes such as zinc or nickel. In general, the current density in copper foil production or metal electrowinning processes is much lower than that in zinc or tin electroplating on steel so that a long lifetim...|$|E

40|$|One {{objective}} of Bureau of Mines recycling {{research is to}} devise technology that enables recovery of metals and minerals from wastes. From October 1982 through September 1985, researchers at the Bureau and at the University of Missouri Rolla (contract H 0222002) investigated the use of nonferrous flue dust with varying Zn contents (11 to 66 pct) {{as a source of}} Zn for electrogalvanizing steel wire. The waste dusts used were from a secondary Cu smelter, a brass smelter, a Pb smelter, and a water treatment plant. The dusts were leached in H 2 S 04, and the leach solutions were treated to make electrolyte for electrogalvanizing steel wire using soluble Zn anodes. Cyclic voltammetry was used in an inno-vative method to evaluate the quality of the electrolytes used for elec-rogalvanizing. After electrogalvanizing, the wire was drawn on a labo-ratory draw bench to simulate industrial practice. Corrosion resistance was measured by a number of electrochemical techniques and by the stan-dard ASTM salt-spray tests. After successful bench-scale tests, the process was demonstrated in an industrial pilot plant. Results indicate that nonferrous flue dusts {{can be used as a}} source of Zn for <b>electro-galvanizing</b> if certain impurities are either partially or completely removed from the starting electrolyte...|$|E

Only the FLC modeled from a singly linear forming limit stress curve exhibits good consistence with experimental curve. It was established that a linearized limit stress locus describes adequately the actual localized neck conditions for the material chosen in this study. The quantitative X-ray microanalysis of the Fe contents in the sheet surface layer composition was used to determine cracking limit curve (CLC) of <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel sheet.

40|$|Drying {{effects on}} {{corrosion}} performance of Cr(VI) - and Cr(III) -treated <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel {{have been studied}} in NaCl solution using potentiodynamic measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Cr(VI) and the Cr(III) treated specimens were dried at three different temperatures: 60, 110 and 210 °C. The surface layers were investigated using SEM, AES and XPS. The {{results show that the}} drying temperature not only affects the morphology of the surface layer, but also changes the chromium oxidation states in the layer. The corrosion protection given to the EG steel by Cr(VI) and Cr(III) pretreatments can be severely reduced if the pretreated surfaces are heated above 110 °C. Both types of coating undergo some dehydration during heat treatments, which is undesirable for good corrosion protection. For Cr(VI) coatings, additional degradation mechanisms include widening of the cracks in the coating, and reduction of Cr(VI) to the Cr(III) oxidation state.

40|$|Autogenous {{laser welding}} of 0. 8 mm thick butt joints of car body <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel sheet DC 04 was investigated. The Yb:YAG disk laser TruDisk 3302 with the beam spot {{diameter}} of 200 μm was used. The effect of laser welding parameters and technological conditions on weld shape, penetration depth, process stability, microstructure and mechanical performance was determined. It {{was found that}} the laser beam spot focused on the top surface of a butt joint tends to pass through the gap, especially in the low range of heat input and high welding speed. All test welds were welded at a keyhole mode, and the weld metal was free of porosity. Thus, the keyhole laser welding of zinc coated steel sheets in butt configuration provides excellent conditions to escape for zinc vapours, with no risk of porosity. Microstructure, microhardness and mechanical performance of the butt joints depend on laser welding conditions thus cooling rate and cooling times. The shortest cooling time t 8 / 5 was calculated for 0. 29 s...|$|R
40|$|Within a {{joint project}} {{scientists}} of Fraunhofer ISC, Fraunhofer IWU and IKS {{have worked together}} to develop an ecologically sustainable concept for a corrosion protection method based on hybrid nano-composites and have evaluated the process {{as an alternative to}} environmentally harmful chromating on top of galvanized steel panes. Different types of zincplated surfaces have been investigated. Selected hybrid polymer nano-composites have been applied on various zinc surfaces in a dip coating process and finally provided with a standard polyester powder coating. The performance of these samples have then been compared with relevant, commercially available anti-corrosion systems in defined test procedures in order to assess the adhesion strength and the degree of corrosion of the laminated composites. In addition, the deformability behaviour in bending and deep-drawing processes has been examined. Especially on <b>electro-galvanized</b> surfaces, samples with the newly developed hybrid nanomaterials exhibited good adhesion and corrosion-protection characteristics after 360 h in the salt spray test (DIN EN ISO 9227 -NSS). Test samples coated with these hybrid materials and covered with polyester powder could easily be bended and deep-drawn, no matter what type of galvanization had been applied. The nano-materials on the whole displayed a tolerant behaviour against the tested galvanizations and showed levels of performance comparable to commercial systems of yellow chromating and Cr(III) -based passivation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of cerium salt {{activated}} nanoparticles as nanoreservoirs on the self-healing properties of silane hybrid coatings deposited on <b>electro-galvanized</b> steel substrates. The substrates were pre-treated with 3 -glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and bisphenol A (BPA), modified with cerium ion-activated CeO 2 -ZrO 2 and CeO 2 -SiO 2 nanoparticles. The morphology of the coating before corrosion tests was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicate the formation of nanostructured surfaces with relatively uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the silane coating containing CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles. The corrosion behavior of the sol-gel coatings was also investigated using salt spray tests, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and potentiodynamic polarization tests. During the salt spray test, the samples are exposed 600 h (or 25 days), revealing the improved resistance of the coated substrate containing CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles. Incorporation of activated CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles reduces the cathodic and anodic current density by one order of magnitude and shifts the corrosion potential to more positive values compared with the coating containing CeO 2 -SiO 2 nanoparticles. Also, the EIS test results revealed higher impedance for the coating containing activated CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles. Corrosion tests {{results suggest that the}} activated CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles are more effective as nano-structured cerium ion reservoirs and can provide prolonged release of the inhibitor ions...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{rise in the}} Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking {{has taken}} place in the EU during the last decade. As a result, the amount of steelmaking dust has increased as well. This dust is recycled in order to recover the valuable amount of zinc present in it. In contrast to the increase in dust generation, the capacity of recycling sites has not changed accordingly and there are growing concerns over this imbalance. In the present thesis, logistics and resource allocation of dust recycling in the EU are analysed. Data collected through a questionnaire survey was used to formulate the transportation model of linear programming. The results of the model highlight the location of gaps in recycling capacity and its uneven geographical distribution. The state of the recycling can be improved by research in scrap de-zincing; a process that can recover most of the zinc prior to steelmaking thereby lowering the total amount of dust. To this effect experiments were conducted using <b>electro-galvanized</b> scrap samples in order to study the kinetics of zinc evaporation. Various parameters such as the flow rate of carrier gas, scrap heating rate, packed bed voidage, permeability, and specific surface area were studied with a view of a possible scale-up of the process. The results show that there is a potential of integrating the de-zincing step into high temperature scrap pre-heating processes using shaft type systems that utilize off-gases of steelmaking and auxiliary burners...|$|R
