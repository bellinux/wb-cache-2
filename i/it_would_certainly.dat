25|$|To prevent {{more people}} from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and {{is placed in}} a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, {{both of whom are}} now working with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up {{becoming}} captured, although he states that he has managed to convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris' execution, but Peter, in return for Tris' rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless take hold of it, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Cast iron {{development}} lagged in Europe, as the smelters {{could only}} achieve temperatures of about 1000 C; {{or perhaps they}} did not want hotter temperatures, as they were seeking to produce blooms as a precursor of wrought iron, not cast iron. Through {{a good portion of the}} Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, Lapphyttan and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the Mongols across Russia to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
50|$|Some maps {{from the}} 1960s with the railway marked mark it as disused, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> have been by that time. Again, it is {{possible}} the tracks were lifted a lot earlier, and the maps of this time are merely marking a railway that had long since disappeared on the ground, by compiling and copying information from earlier maps. If the track did survive in situ into the 1960s, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>certainly</b> been removed during the 1970s and the conflict that swept over Cambodia during that decade.|$|R

25|$|Egg {{collecting}} {{for food}} {{on a massive}} scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season's eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even egg collecting on a scale that significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the red-tailed tropicbirds and the Sula are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done {{at the height of the}} Polynesian civilization.|$|E
25|$|Conall's Constantinian shield, {{and this}} motto, {{have been the}} main O’Donnell arms in various forms, through the centuries. The motto also appears {{prominently}} placed as a motto on a ribbon unfurled with a passion cross to its left, beneath a window over the Scala Regia, adjacent to Bernini's equestrian statue of Emperor Constantine, in the Vatican. Emperors and other monarchs, having paid respects to the Pope, descended the Scala Regia, and would observe the light shining down through the window, with the motto, reminiscent of Constantine's vision, and be reminded to follow the Cross. They would thence turn right into the atrium of St. Peter's Basilica, ostensibly so inspired. In an earlier version (before Bernini's renovations in the mid-17th century), something similar may have resonated with and been observed by Prince Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell following his visit to Pope Paul V (at the Palazzo Quirinale) in Rome, just prior to his death in 1608. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have resonated with and been observed by Cardinal Patrick O'Donnell.|$|E
500|$|Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is {{currently}} impossible to prove or disprove. [...] Both Redford's and Murnane's {{works on the}} subject are undecided {{on the grounds that}} there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would have made no difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have been logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E

500|$|Rhys {{tries to}} make things up to Elaine by taking her to the {{hospital}} to meet his colleagues, but when she questions his motives for [...] "going public" [...] and admitting who she is, Rhys has to look at himself and his attitude towards her. In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> create a lot of interesting dilemmas".|$|E
500|$|Allied {{commander}}s, {{and later}} historians, debated whether the Admiralty Islands Campaign was the bold action {{of a great}} commander or a reckless endeavour that courted disaster. Admiral Fechteler felt, [...] "we're damn lucky we didn't get run off the island," [...] and Admiral Barbey, for one, believed the original plan {{would have resulted in}} overrunning the islands in short order with fewer casualties. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have been much less risky, but it is doubtful whether an assault on the well-defended beaches of Seeadler Harbour would have resulted in fewer casualties. Whereas, in accelerating both MacArthur and Nimitz's campaigns, it shortened the war by at least a month. Thus, in the final analysis, the campaign [...] "had the great virtue of hastening victory while reducing the number of dead and wounded".|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of the names [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus" [...] and [...] "Juliane" [...] on items in the Hoxne Hoard need not imply that people by those names owned {{the rest of the}} hoard, either {{at the time of its}} burial or previously. There are no historical references to an [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus" [...] in Britain in this period. While a [...] "Marcus Aurelius Ursicinus" [...] is recorded in the Praetorian Guard in Rome in the period 222–235, a soldier or official of the late fourth or early fifth century would be more likely to take the imperial nomen Flavius, rather than Aurelius. This leads Tomlin to speculate [...] "The name [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus" [...] might sound old-fashioned; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have been more appropriate to a provincial landowner than an army officer or government official".|$|E

2500|$|Biologist E. O. Wilson has {{advocated}} {{the eradication of}} several species of mosquito, including malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Wilson stated, [...] "I'm talking about {{a very small number}} of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be acceptable to remove them.

But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value [...] we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be possible to draw another nickel next.

2500|$|US {{officials}} {{feared that}} should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> escalate {{tension between the}} neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its [...] "absolute, total" [...] cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai. Rice travelled to India on 4 December 2008, {{at the request of}} President George W. Bush, {{in the wake of the}} Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for [...] "direct and tough action" [...] by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were [...] "non-state actors".|$|E

5000|$|In the {{original}} 1967 publication of The Report From Iron Mountain, written {{at the suggestion}} of Victor Navasky, Lewin was credited only as the author of the introduction to a purported government report that concluded that if a lasting peace [...] "could be achieved, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> not be {{in the best interests of}} society to achieve it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Even legal {{settlements}} {{between the}} two opposing lords are recorded; they often knew one other personally and occupied the same social position. They might negotiate a deadline, which apparently was usually around 30 days. If the lord or the allies of the besieged did not appear within this period before the castle, the defenders surrendered the fort without a fight. In return, they received safe conduct and were sometimes allowed to take their household with them too. Such a treaty could save life and avoid unnecessary costs on both sides. However <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> require some ability to defend the castle and main tower. To [...] "fight to the end" [...] could be very risky. For example, in 1224, the higher ranks of the defenders of Bedford Castle in England were hanged {{in front of the}} castle after the main tower had been demolished by troops of King HenryIII. In Central Europe during the German Peasants' War castles were surrendered after an assurance of safe passage had been given.|$|E
2500|$|The Kennedy {{campaign}} {{began to}} focus on Oregon. Its workers repeatedly denied that Morse was a serious candidate, but to make sure of a win, the campaign sent Rose Kennedy and Ted Kennedy to speak in Oregon and outspent Morse $54,000 to $9,000. [...] Morse often found himself responding to Kennedy’s claim that he was not a “serious candidate”, by proclaiming: “I’m a dead serious candidate.” Quietly, Oregon Democrats began to worry about what a loss for Morse would mean in 1962 against possible Republican challenger Governor Mark Hatfield. Morse would use this to his advantage to help sway undecided Democrats, claiming that if he lost in the primary, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> help Republicans defeat him in 1962. Kennedy brushed off this argument by claiming that regardless of the outcome of the presidential primary, the people of Oregon had a tremendous respect for Wayne Morse and would send him back to the Senate, and that he would even come back to Oregon in 1962 to campaign for him. [...] On Election Day, Morse came up roughly 50,000 votes short of defeating Kennedy. Morse abandoned his presidential race that same week.|$|E
2500|$|Neil Innes is {{the only}} non-Python besides Douglas Adams to be {{credited}} with writing material for Flying Circus. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl. He was also a regular stand-in for absent team members {{on the rare occasions}} when they recreated sketches. For example, he took the place of Cleese at the Concert for George. Gilliam once noted that if anyone qualified for the title of the seventh Python, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be Innes. He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat Bonzo Dog Band. He would later portray Ron Nasty of the Rutles and write all of the Rutles' compositions for All You Need Is Cash (1978). By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles [...] "reunion" [...] album The Rutles: Archaeology and Idle's straight-to-DVD The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch, each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the Chicago Tribune in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back [...] "too far. And no further." [...] Innes has remained silent on the dispute.|$|E

And when, {{in a very short}} time, the story was published, we found that the reading public was inclined to receive it with as much sympathetic interest and favor as had been shown to it by the editors. My personal friends soon began to express enthusiastic opinions upon it. It was highly praised in many of the leading newspapers, and, altogether, it was a great literary success. I am not inclined to be vain of my writings, and, in general, my wife tells me, I think too little of them. But I did feel a good deal of pride and satisfaction in the success of [...] "His Wife's Deceased Sister."
