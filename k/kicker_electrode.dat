40|$|A novel type of slotted or {{perforated}} strip-line pick-up or <b>kicker</b> <b>electrode</b> {{structure for}} non relativistic particle beams with b=v/c values around 0. 7 is presented. This slotted structure {{is to be}} used as a forward coupler with the output signal taken from the downstream end and has a rather large relative bandwidth of several octaves. Possible applications are stochastic cooling systems e. g. for ions beams in the momentum range mentioned above. This electrode may also be used for Schottky diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|The {{collector}} ring (CR) {{of the proposed}} GSI project FAIR includes a fast stochastic cooling system for exotic nuclei and antiprotons. To reach a good {{signal to noise ratio}} of the pick‐up even with a low number of particles, a novel pick‐up and <b>kicker</b> <b>electrode</b> system based on slotlines is presented. The sensitivity and noise properties of electrode models are calculated. These are compared with other types of electrodes. Different options for signal processing and layout of a pick‐up or kicker with many electrodes for different beam velocities are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{new system}} of a {{betatron}} oscillation monitor in the KEK 12 GeV proton synchrotron has been developed. Sys-tem {{is a combination of}} a transverse beam kicker, betatron oscillation beam monitor and a fast data acquisition. The circulating beam is transversely kicked by a white noise signal and a digitizer module acquires the detected oscilla-tion signal and automatically FFT analyzed. Noise genera-tor, power amplifier controller, fast digitizer etc. are in-stalled in a separated powered chassis and connected each other by employing an optical fiber network. Data acquisi-tion system by a combination of plug-in-modules and chas-sis is newly developed by Yokogawa electric corporation [1] according to plug-and-play architecture. Figure 1. System configuration. 1 Betatron oscillation monitor system. The betatron oscillation monitor system consists of a white noise generator, transverse beam kicker and fast data acquisition modules. System configuration is depicted in figure 1. Noise signal bandwidth is controlled so as to include the several spectrums of the betatron oscillation side bands around the revolution spectrum in order to obtain an effi-cient transverse kick. The amplitude of the beam kick is controlled sufficient but as small as possible for detecting the beam transverse oscillation without any degradation of the beam quality[2]. Figure 2 shows the cross sectional view of the beam <b>kicker</b> <b>electrode...</b>|$|E
40|$|Absfrocl [...] Pickup and <b>kicker</b> <b>electrodes</b> that {{function}} in the 4 - 8 GHz frequency range were designed for bunched beam cooling applications in the Fermilab TEVATRON. The electrodes are planar and arc fabricated with photolithographic techniques on woven Teflon board. The electrodes also have a variable transverse aperture ranging from 0. 75 ” to 4 ” to accommodate the changing beam size in the TEVATRON during acceleration. To accommodate the plunging action of the electrodes, a unique flexible microwave transition piece was also incorporated into the design. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{stochastic}} cooling crucially {{depends on the}} interaction between the beam and high frequency devices for detection (pick-up <b>electrodes)</b> and deflection (<b>kicker</b> <b>electrodes).</b> This contribution shows the theoretical investigation of a planar electrode to be used for stochastic cooling of secondary particles with a beta of 0. 83. The coupling to the beam is realised by a slot line. Transition networks are added to extract the signal. The detailed investigation is performed via a numerical electromagnetic field analysis. The longitudinal kick of the deflectors is calculated {{as a function of the}} beam position and scaled to the applied voltage. According to the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem the transverse kick is obtained simultaneously. The electromagnetic properties of the discussed electrode are compared to existing ones as currently in use in the ESR storage ring (GSI, Darmstadt) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{strip line}} <b>electrodes</b> of the <b>kickers</b> {{used in the}} {{transverse}} bunch-by-bunch feedback systems see significant power deposition by beam and HOM-induced currents. This leads to elevated temperatures of the aluminum electrodes and will ultimately become a limit for the beam current in the Low Energy Ring. Heat is transported to the environment primarily by radiation from the blackened surface of the electrodes. In order to extend the beamcurrent range of these <b>kickers,</b> new <b>electrodes</b> have been fabricated from molybdenum which are able to run at significantly higher temperature, thus greatly increasing {{the efficiency of the}} radiative cooling of the electrodes. Blackening of the electrodes is achieved by oxidation in air at 530 Æ C (1000 Æ F) using a recipe first applied in aviation research for supersonic aircraft. Emissivity was measured on coupons and a whole electrode to be about 0. 6. In addition, the match at the terminations of the electrodes is improved following field calculations and measurements on a model of the kicker...|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the dynamic devices used to interact with the charged-particle beams in accelerators or storage rings can be classified as pickups or kickers. These devices act through time-varying electromagnetic fields either to extract information about the particle's motion or to effect a change in that motion. A given configuration of electrodes may be used either as a pickup or as a kicker; that duality will be addressed in this paper. An example of a simple electrode is the loop antenna, which may be made in the shape of an electrical stripline at the side of a beam chamber. This electrode. picks up a signal from the beam current by intercepting time-varying magnetic flux and image charges of the beam. One can also understand that the difference signal from two such striplines placed {{on opposite sides of the}} beam will give information on the beam's transverse position. This same electrode, if externally excited as a kicker, can produce transverse forces through its magnetic field acting on moving charges; and its electric fields in the direction of the particle motion produce its effects as a longitudinal <b>kicker.</b> <b>Electrodes</b> for a particular application call for response over a particular range of frequencies. The stripline electrodes provide useful coupling over a range greater than one octave, centered about frequencies usually between 100 EIHz and 10 GHz. In this same frequency region, a narrow-band device is the r. f. cavity which can be employed as either a sensitive pickup or a high-power accelerating or deflecting electrode; the rf accelerating system of a particle accelerator is a specialized example of such a kicker. A particular wave form with short rise time, then long flat dwell, is called for in the pulsed magnet kicker used to inject beam onto a closed orbit. Depending on the application, analysis, and description, an electrode's performance may be in either the time domain or the frequency domain. relations between longitudinal and transverse effects, and between the responses as pickup and as kicker. We shall see that dynamic effects are entirely determined by the longitudinal electric fields in the direction of the beam current when the electrode is excited as a kicker; and as a corollary, absence of longitudinal electric fields guarantees no coupling to beam particles. Response functions that serve as figures of merit will be defined. We shall then analyze the responses of specific examples of pickups and kickers. Finally, an approach to the calculation of the transverse variation of coupling over the electrode aperture will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{the peak}} {{luminosity}} achieved on the DAΦNE collider has been improved by almost a factor three by implementing a novel collision {{scheme based on}} large Piwinski angle and Crab-Waist. This encouraging result opened new perspectives for physics research and a new run with the KLOE- 2 detector has been scheduled to start by spring 2010. The KLOE- 2 installation is a complex operation requiring a careful design effort and a several months long shutdown. The high luminosity interaction region has been deeply revised {{in order to take}} into account the effect on the beam caused by the solenoidal field of the experimental detector and to ensure background rejection. The shutdown has been also used to implement several other modifications aimed at improving beam dynamics: the wiggler poles have been displaced from the magnet axis in order to cancel high order terms in the field, the feedback systems have been equipped with stronger power supplies and more efficient <b>kickers</b> and <b>electrodes</b> have been inserted inside the wiggler and the dipole vacuum chambers, in the positron ring, to avoid the e-cloud formation. A low level RF feedback has been added to the cavity control in both rings. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figures, presented to the IPAC 10 conferenc...|$|R
