The soil samples were taken in the 26 th and 27 th years of the experiment, (in 2009, 2010) from maize monoculture and tri-culture. In addition to the effects of fertilizer doses, correlations among soil chemical and microbiological properties were established; and the various ratios among some microbiological parameters were also evaluated. The elements of NPK fertilizers increased together with the doses, so the elements’ effect cannot be separated, the minimum factor is not identifiable. With increasing fertilizer doses, the soil pH decreased in both the mono- and triculture, parallelly there was a significant increase in <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity.</b> A close negative correlation was proved between the pH(H 2 O) and <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> and pH(KCl) and <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity.</b> An increased soil nutrient content was recorded in each NPK treatment, the available phosphorus and nitrate content increased in a higher proportion than that of potassium.

40|$|The {{negative}} trend of soil degradation process increases with intensive agricultural production. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for soil conditioning like liming, humification, fertilization, etc. to improve soil quality. One of the major problems that occur on agricultural soils of Croatia is acidification. A downward trend of soil pH is mainly present in soils of poor structure with intensive agricultural production. In agricultural practice liming often needs to rely only on the pH value, without determining the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity,</b> CEC or soil texture. Due to the above mentioned facts, calculation of liming for Osijek-Baranja County was conducted with the help of ALRxp calculator, which takes CEC, soil pH in KCl, <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity,</b> bulk density of soil, soil textural class and depth of the plow layer to 30 cm into account. Low soil pH values have a great influence on soil suitability for crops as well as on the deficit of calcium and magnesium. All of these lead to the degradation of soil structure, and can even lead to disturbances of plant nutrition in some production areas. On such soils, liming would be imperatively required, but with caution because an excessive intake of lime materials, especially without the necessary analysis, causes a decline in organic matter and reduces accessibility for plant uptake of microelements...|$|E

The pot experiment was conducted on a light soil, with weak loamy sand grain size composition and slightly acid reaction, which was enriched with a supplement of bottom sediment. The test plant was a maize, Bora c. v. An applied bottom deposit revealed in its composition a considerable content of clay fractions, alkaline reaction and low total heavy metal content. Therefore, it may be applied as an admixture to light soils to improve their productivity. The addition of sediment to light soil resulted in the improvement of acidification in soil indicators: increased soil pH and reduced value of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity,</b> as well as improved sorption properties.

The simple regression model could be accurate enough using just actual soil pH only for soils with lower humus content. Model accuracy increases including more soil data in prediction model, starting from adding soil exchangeable pH and then including humus data. Because of possible high soil sample variance, the best simple models are model including both actual and exchangeable soil pH, and humus, but with different regression equation for each range of soil pH or/and for each range of humus content. These kinds of models are sensitive to soil cation exchange capacity, humus content, texture and soil acidity, indicating that model adjustment to soil types could result in increasing model accuracy.

The rapid increase in the content of Ca and Mg is related to the liming in 2002. Fertilizer application significantly supported the development of ground-weed on plots of Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch, while in pure stands of Colorado blue spruce led to a reduction in aboveground biomass. For the Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch plot compared with only Colorado blue spruce plot were documented favourable soil properties, increased supply of total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Rowan tree on an intact soil surface exhibits the lowest reaction pH as humus and in the mineral, high <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity,</b> extremely sorption unsaturated soil state, high content of ion Al 3 + and low content of available calcium, although was applied liming. Technical and biological reclamation (Boleboř III.) has a long-term positive effect on the average height and breast-height diameter of Colorado blue spruce and white pine. The growth dynamics of European larch and Lodgepole pine were affect only at the beginning. Meliorated stand of Gray Alder has very good growth dynamics, comparable with Larch and Lodgepole pine. The big problem is the game impact, especially in Lodgepole pine, which led to the destruction of all individuals. Colorado Blue spruce in terms of biological reclamation is totally inappropriate. This Spruce has reduced resistance to abiotic factors, which often suffer uprooting and breakage. During the 21 years the Clorado Blue spruce mixed with birch accumulated of 66, 09 t. ha- 1 humus matter with better properties also in the deeper horizon. Colorado Blue spruce accumulated 54, 11 t. ha- 1 of humus matter. Rowan tree accumulated on the intact soil largest amount of humus matter (194, 98 t. ha- 1), however acidifies the deeper horizons. The stand of Norway Spruce occurred during the reporting period a decrease of 47 % to 107, 03 t. ha- 1. The decline may be associated with more open stand and due to air liming...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{plasticity}} is {{the area}} of soil consistency, i. e. it represents a change in soil condition due to different soil moisture influenced by external forces activity. Consistency determines soil resistance in tillage, therefore, {{the aim of the}} research was to determine the optimum soil moisture condition for tillage and the influence of the chemical and physical properties of the arable land horizons on the soil plasticity on three different types of soil (fluvisol, luvisol and humic glaysol). Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} all examined soil types, such as the content of clay particles, the density of packaging and the actual and substitution acidity, the cation exchange capacity and the content of calcium. There were also statistically significant differences between the examined types of soil for the plasticity limit, liquid limit and the plasticity index. The average established value of plasticity limit as an important element for determining the optimal moment of soil tillage was 18. 9 % mass on fluvisol, 24. 0 % mass on luvisol and 28. 6 % mass on humic glaysol. Very significant positive direction correlation with plasticity limits was shown by organic matter, clay, fine silt, magnesium, sodium and calcium, while very significant negative direction correlation was shown by <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity,</b> coarse sand, fine sand and coarse silt. Created regression models can estimate the optimal soil moisture condition for soil cultivation based on the basic soil properties. The model precision is significantly increased by introducing a greater number of agrochemical and agrophysical soil properties, and the additional precision of the model can be increased by soil type data...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} diesel oil {{contamination}} {{on the number}} of soil microrflora in light clay sand and light clay was determined in a pot experiment. The experimental soil was contaminated with the following doses of diesel oil (ON) calculated as maximum water capacity (MWC) : 0; 0. 5; 1; 1. 5; 2; 2. 5 and 3 %. The lowest dose of diesel oil (0. 5 % MWC) for the lighter soil was 1. 67 g · kg- 1 d. m. and for heavier soil it was 1. 71 g · kg- 1 d. m. Varied urea fertilization also was applied: 0 and 250 mg N g · kg- 1 d. m. of soil. For the initial 18 days, the pots were maintained unsown. On day 18, the Juno variety of yellow lupine was planted (7 plants per pot). The yellow lupine plants were harvested at the blooming phase. Soil samples were taken on day 18 and immediately after yellow lupine harvest. Based on the results, soil contamination with 0. 5 % to 3. 0 % MWC of diesel oil was found to disturb the soil microbiological balance. This substance stimulated the development of oligotrophic, copiotro-phic, sporulating copiotrophic and Actinomycetales and inhibited the development of Azotobacter spp. and cellulolytic bacteria. Fertilisation with urea had a positive effect on the multiplication of the above microorganisms. The number of oligotrophic, copiotrophic bacteria and Actinomycetales was higher in the light clay, whereas the number of sporulating oligotrophic, sporulating copiotrophic and cellulolytic bacteria and fungi was greater in light clay sand soil. Yellow lupine cultivation had a positive effect on the multiplication of sporulating oligotrophic, copiotrophic and cellulolytic bacteria and fungi in both analyzed types of soil. <b>Hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> and organic carbon content were positively correlated, whereas pH, total exchangeable cations and alkaline cation soil saturation were negatively correlated with soil contamination with diesel oil...|$|E

The samples were taken from the research field of Lviv State Agrarian University, from the layer of 0 - 60 cm deep. Heavy metals were applied to top layer of soil as water salt solutions with different doses, namely 0, 32, 160, 320 mg kg- 1 for Pb (Pb(CH 3 COO) 2) and 0, 3, 15, 30 mg kg- 1 for Cd (CdCl 2 · 2. 5 H 2 O). Basic chemical and physical properties, such as soil reaction, organic carbon content, grain size composition, total surface area, porosity, <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> of the samples were analysed using routine laboratory procedures. The soluble forms of Pb and Cd were also investigated. The soil reaction ranged between 6. 8 and 7. 5 in 1 M KCl and 7. 4 - 8. 1 in H 2 O, whereas the content of organic C ranged between 0. 62 and 1. 59 %. No significant relationship was detected between cadmium and lead amounts and the grain size composition of investigated samples. The pore volume of polluted soils ranged from 370 mm 3 g- 1 to 515 mm 3 g- 1 and was higher for Cd- polluted than for Pb-polluted soils. The total surface area of the soils varied from 26. 83 m 2 g- 1 to 40. 02 m 2 g- 1. Content of available forms of cadmium and lead was the highest in the top layers of soils. Presence of those elements was similar to that in the control sample at the depth of 30 cm only for small initial doses of Cd and Pb. Content of Cd and Pb for the highest doses and at the deepest soil level was higher than for the control sample.

The {{pot experiment}} was set up in 2007 and 2008 at the Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science of the Debrecen University in three replications. The average results of the two year experiment can be summarized as follows: The pH increased due to the effect of small and medium amendment doses. The bentonite treatments proved to be more effective than the zeolite doses. As the pH increased, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> – in case of the bentonite treatments significantly – decreased. Concerning the easily available nutrient content of soil, the small and medium amendment doses turned out to be effective. The large bentonite doses reduced the nitrate-N content, the easily available phosphorus and potassium contents of soil. Large dose zeolite treatments decreased the nitrate-N content, but increased both the phosphorus and potassium content of soil, in most cases significantly. Regarding the measured soil microbial parameters, the small and medium amendment doses were the most effective. The bentonite and zeolite treatments increased the biomass of perennial ryegrass, especially the small and medium doses of bentonite and the large dose of zeolite brought about significant increases. According to the statistical analyses moderate and close correlations were found between the parameters studied. In the bentonite treatments a close correlation was established between the aerobic cellulose decomposing bacteria and saccharase enzyme activity (r = 0. 864) of soil. In the case of zeolite treatments, a close correlation was found between the number of nitrifying bacteria and microbial biomass C (r = 0. 911) of soil...|$|E

Therefore, we studied the effects of different doses of N fertilization on soil organic matter and chemical properties of Haplic Luvisol in the locality of Dolná Malanta (Slovakia) during 2014 - 2016. Soil samples were collected from the plots exposed to the following treatments: 1. N 0 - no N fertilization as control during 2014 - 2016, 2. N 40 – N fertilizer at the rate of 40 kg N ha – 1 in 2014 and 2016, 3. N 80 – N fertilizer at the rate of 80 kg N ha – 1 in 2014 and 2016, 4. N 160 – N fertilizer at the rate of 160 kg N ha – 1 in 2015, and 5. N 240 – N fertilizer at the rate of 240 kg N ha – 1 in 2015. The results showed that in N 80 the soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased by 32 % in comparison to N 0. The addition of 80 t ha - 1 of N significantly decreased the humic substances (HS) content in the soil by 16 % compared to N 0. The higher doses of N fertilization 80 rather than 40 kg ha - 1 as well as 240 rather than 160 kg ha - 1 significantly decreased humus stability. The addition of N fertilization decreased the average values of soil pH. Values of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> (Ha) increased by 41 % and 46 % in N 40 and N 80, respectively than N 0, but on the other hand, this one decreased by 36 % and 27 % in N 160 and N 240, respectively in comparison to N 0. Positive statistically significant correlations were determined between soil pH and SOC in N 40 and N 80 treatments. The increase of soil pH was connected with higher humus quality in N 160 and N 240. Negative correlations between humic acids (HA) and sum of basic cations (SBC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were observed in N 80 < N 160 < N 240 treatments. Higher values of fulvic acids corresponded with lesser CEC in N 80 and N 160 treatments. In N 160, with increased humus quality, CEC significantly decreased. The same effect was observed in N 240. In addition, in N 240, we also observed that with increased CHA:CFA ratio SBC and base saturation significantly decreased...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} alginit {{on the soil}} and on {{triticale}} was studied over three years, from 2012 to 2014, in a long-term field experiment set up on acidic sandy soil in Nyirlugos 53 years ago. A 100 t•ha- 1 rate of alginit was applied in autumn 2011 on plots given 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg•ha- 1 •year- 1 N. The originally 5 x 10 = 50 m 2 plots were halved, and the halves without alginit treatment served as controls. The 4 N + 4 N (with alginit) = 8 treatments × 4 replications = 32 plots. The main results are as follows: 1. Physical soil measurements showed that alginit treatment {{had no effect on}} the total porosity or water capacity of the soil. The field capacity increased by 4. 4 % on average, but this was not significant. The saturation percentage (KA according to Arany) rose significantly from 30. 2 to 31. 6. 2. On alginit-treated plots the pH(KCl) increased from 3. 9 to 6. 2, CEC from 1. 3 to 3. 6, EC from 21 to 67 ms/cm and base saturation from 53 % to 74 %, while the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>acidity</b> decreased from 10 to 6 after the first year. 3. NH 4 -acetate + EDTA-soluble Ca increased from 154 to 730, K 2 O from 50 to 62, Mg from 18 to 104, Sr from 0. 9 to 4. 4 mg•kg- 1 and Ni from 125 to 330 μ g•kg- 1 on the alginit-treated plots. 4. The straw and grain yield of triticale increased in all three years. Alginit treatment generally doubled the yields, especially on plots treated with 150 kg•ha- 1 •year- 1 N, which became acidified and impoverished in Ca, Mg, K and P. 5. Alginit treatment increased the Mg, Mo and Cd uptake and reduced that of Mn, Zn and Ba by triticale seeds. The Ca, Mg, S and Mo concentrations increased in the straw, while the incorporation of Mn, Zn, Ba, Cu, Ni and Co was inhibited by alginit. 6. Alginit is a suitable mineral for the amelioration of similar acid sands, which may eliminate the acidity caused by excessive N supplies and improve the water holding capacity, colloidal and nutrient status and drought-tolerance, and thus their fertility...|$|E
