5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God {{that is the}} end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market based philosophies. Grant later speculated that this transformation would be detectable within stories he'd written. By 1997, Grant's philosophy settled on Neo-Tech, which was developed by Frank R. Wallace, and when given the opportunity to write an Anarky miniseries, he decided to redesign the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was continued in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E

[...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> its weapons.

500|$|The {{writings}} of Carl Jung were influential in Le Guin's work. In an essay discussing his impact, Le Guin stated that {{to find a}} true sense of community, a child had to confront the unexplored parts of its own self, or what Jung {{referred to as the}} [...] "collective unconscious". Thus many of her writings feature young people trying to find a sense of community in circumstances of lawlessness and disorder. Voices depicts characters who are unable to explore their identities due to the oppressive regime they live under, an inability which particularly affects the young characters. Another recurring theme in Voices <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> words and storytelling, illustrated through the character of Orrec, who uses his poetry to spread ideas of freedom. The title [...] "Voices" [...] has multiple interpretations: the voices of the poets that are frequently referred to, the voice of the Oracle, the voices of the people of Ansul who rise up against the Alds, and the voice of Memer herself.|$|E
