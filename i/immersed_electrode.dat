40|$|A {{recently}} developed method {{of determining the}} number and size of particles suspended in a conducting solution is to pump the suspension through a small orifice having an <b>immersed</b> <b>electrode</b> on each side to supply electrical current. The current changes due {{to the passage of}} particles of resistivity {{different from that of the}} solution. Theoretical expressions are developed which relate the current change caused by such particles to their volume and shape. It is found that most biological cells may be treated as dielectric particles whose capacitive effects are negligible. Electrolytic tank measurements on models confirm the theoretical development, and electric field plots of model orifices are used to predict the observed pulse shapes. An equivalent circuit of the orifice-electrode system is analyzed and shows that the current pulse may be made conductivity-independent when observed with a zero input impedance amplifier...|$|E

For plat inum black electrodes, and temperatures rang-ing from 25 ~ to 170 ~ the l imiting current varies l inearly with the square root of electrolyte conductivity, electrode polarization, and oxygen partial pressure.

Approximate calculations of the activation energy of diffusion using parameters from the rate equation give values which are close to those ex-pected for a diffusional process.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of single-crystal aluminium oriented in the (111), (110) and (100) {{directions in}} chloride- and indium-containing solutions was studied. It {{was found that}} the susceptibility of the single crystals to the onset of pitting attack in the chloride solution varied in the order (111) >(110) >(100). This was evident from pitting potential and induction time data, where the most noble pitting potential values and the longest induction periods were recorded for the (100) surface. This was explained in terms of differences in the surface energy of (111), (110) and (100) planes. It was also found that cathodic reduction reactions (hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions) proceeded at a greater rate on the (100) surface. In addition, the time delay between the addition of indium ions to solution and the onset of activation of the <b>immersed</b> <b>electrode</b> by the indium species was shorter for the (100) surface. This was attributed to the more efficient incorporation of indium into the (100) lattice...|$|E

40|$|Scanning Photo-Induced Impedance Microscopy (SPIM) is an {{impedance}} {{imaging technique}} {{that is based}} on photocurrent measurements at field-effect structures. The material under investigation is deposited onto a semiconductor-insulator substrate. A thin metal film or an electrolyte solution with an <b>immersed</b> <b>electrode</b> serves as the gate contact. A modulated light beam focused into the space charge region of the semiconductor produces a photocurrent, which {{is directly related to the}} local impedance of the material. The absolute impedance of a polymer film can be measured by calibrating photocurrents using a known impedance in series with the sample. Depending on the wavelength of light used, charge carriers are not only generated in the focus but also throughout the bulk of the semiconductor. This can have adverse effects on the lateral resolution. Two-photon experiments were carried out to confine charge carrier generation to the spacecharge layer. The lateral resolution of SPIM is also limited by the lateral diffusion of charge carriers in the semiconductor. This problem can be solved by using thin silicon layers as semiconductor substrates. A resolution of better than 1 mu m was achieved using silicon on sapphire (SOS) substrates with a I l. Lm thick silicon layer...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} three-dimensional computational fluid {{dynamic model}} has been developed to investigate the internal dynamics of a circular, three-phase electrical furnace as used for the smelting of Platinum Group Metal (PGM) concentrates. The model included multi-phase interactions between multiple fluid layers and CO-gas bubble release from the <b>immersed</b> <b>electrode</b> surface while three-phase AC electrical current was simulated at the electrodes. The model further accounts for the heat associated with the melting of concentrate which was thermodynamically calculated and incorporated by assuming zones of varying smelting intensity within the concentrate layer. The relationship between electrode immersion depths, at 15 %, 35 % and 55 % in the slag, and the current distribution and slag electrical resistivity has been quantified while the temperature and velocity fields were obtained for 35 % electrode immersion model, a typical operation case. The slag was identified as being at a fairly uniform temperature due to the mixing induced by natural buoyancy and the CO-bubble-momentum with the highest flow noted between and directly around the electrodes. The matte showed a stratified temperature distribution with little flow activity. The model results were found to correlate well with previously published studies and actual operating parameters. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} may {{be defined}} as a device that performs mathematical operations on input data to yield results which may otherwise be obtained by more laborious and time-consuming methods. Analogue computers represent a general method of using one physical system as a model for another system, more difficult to construct or measure, that obeys equations of the same form. An analogue computer is one which deals with continuously variable physical magnitude; a simple example is the use of an electrolytic trough to plot lines of current flow between <b>immersed</b> <b>electrodes,</b> which are analogous to the lines of electric intensity between similar electrodes in free space.

40|$|Liquid {{and solid}} {{radioactive}} wastes are formed during conversion of plutonium metal to oxide and during fabrication of weapons-grade plutonium into mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. In Russia, these wastes {{are to be}} processed for disposition by immobilization in either borosilicate glass or cement matrices depending upon the waste stream-specific radionuclide contents. Vitrification is planned for the liquid high-level waste raffinate stream containing {{the bulk of the}} Am- 241 produced from Pu- 241 decay. Previous work on the Russian MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (R-MFFF) by the Public Joint Stock Corporation (TVEL) [1] showed that this waste stream may contain significant amounts of silver derived from the electrochemical dissolution of PuO 2 using a Ag(II) catalyst. The work reported here further investigated silver solubility limits, which, if exceeded in a production glass melter, allow discrete silver grains to form in the glass and also deposit over time on the bottom of a joule-heated ceramic melter. In melters with <b>immersed</b> <b>electrodes,</b> such as the Russian EP- 100 for phosphate glasses or the US Duratek DP- 100 type melters for borosilicate glasses that are being considered for use at the Siberian Chemical Combine (SCC) Tomsk site, the undissolved silver could cause a short circuit and an unacceptable production melter failure. The silver solubility limit of 3. 85 wt% Ag{sub 2 }O in liquid, alpha-bearing wastes determined in this work will guide the production scale use of borosilicate glass compositions, and effectively increase the capacity of the ceramic melters and reduce the total volume of solidified vitrified wastes at SCC Tomsk that require storage prior to geologic disposal...|$|R
