In addition, the loss of all immovable property and, when rushed, the loss of substantial amounts of movable property, is implied.

5000|$|The protest Qidong {{was part}} of a series of {{large-scale}} environmental protests related to industrial projects in China. Less than one month earlier, a large, student-led protest in Shifang stopped construction on a massive copper smelting plant. Earlier, protesters in Dalian similarly succeeded in getting a chemical factory shut down due to environmental concerns. [...] Willy Wo-Lap Lam suggests that the protest in Qidong was representative of a growing rights consciousness among Chinese citizens, as well as a greater willingness to assert those rights. Lam noted that while authorities crack down [...] "mercilessly" [...] on protests perceived as being anti-Communist Party or anti-government, they are [...] "willing to strike a deal" [...] when the protests related to <b>environmental</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> concerns, {{as in the case of}} Qidong.|$|E

50|$|Many critics {{concede that}} sprawl {{produces}} some negative externalities; however {{there is some}} dispute about {{the most effective way}} to reduce these negative effects. Gordon & Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual <b>environmental</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl. They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of market based fees (such as emission fees, congestion charging or road pricing) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution.|$|E

5000|$|Cookbooks {{that serve}} as basic kitchen {{references}} (sometimes known as [...] "kitchen bibles") {{began to appear in}} the early modern period. They provided not just recipes but overall instruction for both kitchen technique and household management. Such books were written primarily for housewives and occasionally domestic servants as opposed to professional cooks, and at times books such as The Joy of Cooking (USA), La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange (France), The Art of Cookery (UK, USA), Il cucchiaio d'argento (Italy), and A Gift to Young Housewives (Russia) have served as references of record for national cuisines. Cookbook also tell stories of the writers themselves and reflect upon the era in which they are written. They often reveal notions of social, political, <b>environmental</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> contexts. For example, during the era of industrialization, convenience foods were brought into many households and were integrated and present in cookbooks written in this time. [...] Related to this class are instructional cookbooks, which combine recipes with in-depth, step-by-step recipes to teach beginning cooks basic concepts and techniques. In vernacular literature, people may collect traditional recipes in family cookbooks.|$|E
50|$|The Ethical, Social, and Cultural Program of the Grand Challenges in Global Health, {{launched}} in 2005, is targeted {{to address the}} ethical, social, and cultural issues that may arise {{as a result of}} the initiative - either in the development of the research itself, or in the implementation of knowledge and technology by the communities in need. The GCGH ESC program is the first significant science project concentrated entirely on ESC issues linked to the developing world. ESC issues can have a series of consequences that involve new technologies and approaches: rejection of safety precautions or genetically modified foods, for example, because of culture sensitivity or perceived health, <b>environmental,</b> <b>or</b> <b>economic</b> risks. The ESC program assumes that science and technology are essential to global health development, but the appropriate development of this technology requires attention to the accompanying ethical, social and cultural issues. The program aims to link ESC activities with the research projects and to include voices from the developing world within these projects. Its two main goals are (1) to provide an advisory service for GCGH projects and (2) to create a research program to facilitate appropriate adoption in the long-term. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation granted money in November 2005 for the program to be carried out. The program is described and discussed at length in a series of four articles published in PLoS Medicine.|$|E
