Linear systems whose {{associated}} block Jacobi iteration matrix B is weakly cyclic gen-erated by the {{cyclic permutation}} a = (a 1, 0. 2, [...] ., 0 ",) {{in the spirit}} of Li and Varga are considered. Regions of convergence for the corresponding block p-cyclic SOR method are derived and the exact convergence domains for real spectra, a(Br), of the same sign are obtained. Moreover, analytical expressions for two special cases for p = 5 are given and numerical results are presented confirming the theory developed. The tools used for this work are mainly from complex analysis and extensive use of (asteroidal) <b>hypocycloids</b> in the complex plane is made to produce our results.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} iterations of two classical geometric constructions, the evolutes and involutes of plane curves, {{and their}} discretizations: evolutes and involutes of plane polygons. In the continuous case, our main {{result is that}} the iterated involutes of closed locally convex curves with rotation number one (possibly, with cusps) converge to their curvature centers (Steiner points), and their limit shapes are <b>hypocycloids,</b> generically, astroids. As a consequence, among such curves only the <b>hypocycloids</b> are homothetic to their evolutes. The bulk of the paper concerns two kinds of discretizations of these constructions: the curves are replaced by polygons, and the evolutes are formed by the circumcenters of the triples of consecutive vertices (PP - evolutes), or by the incenters of the triples of consecutive sides (AA -evolutes). For equiangular polygons, the theory is parallel to the continuous case: we define discrete <b>hypocycloids</b> (equiangular polygons whose sides are tangent to <b>hypocycloids)</b> and a discrete Steiner point. The space of polygons is a vector bundle over the space of the side directions; our main result here is that both kinds of evolutes define vector bundle morphisms. In the case of PP -evolutes, the induced map of the base is 4 -periodic, and the dynamics reduces to the linear maps on the fibers. We prove that the spectra of these linear maps are symmetric with respect to the origin. The asymptotic dynamics of linear maps is determined by their eigenvalues with the maximum modulus, and we show that all types of behavior can occur: in particular, hyperbolic, when this eigenvalue is real, and elliptic, when it is complex. We also study PP - and AA -involutes and prove that the side directions of iterated AA -involutes of polygons with odd number of sides behave ergodically; this generalizes well-known results concerning iterations of the construction of the pedal triangle. In addition to the theoretical study, we performed numerous computer experiments; some of the observations remain unexplained...|$|R

The centre of the internal element is offset relative to the centre of the external element and moving in a circle with the radius e (eccentricity). The speed of displacement of the centres is-n times the speed of the rotation speed of the internal element if the external element is stationary. A further feature can be achieved by making the pump conical. If both elements have a larger cross section in one end the axial force will determine the compression between the two elements.
