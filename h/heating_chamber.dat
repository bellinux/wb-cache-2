2500|$|The {{original}} plan shown to journalists {{at the foundation}} ceremony showed a nave [...] by , and a chancel [...] by [...] The widths of the south porch, and {{the north and south}} aisles were [...] and [...] wide respectively. At the east end of the north aisle, alongside the chancel, was a space for the organ (this was in place by 1907, as pictured above). Beneath the chancel and the east ends of both aisles were [...] "spacious vestries and a heating chamber." [...] By the time of the September 1887 consecration, these undercroft rooms had become two vestries, a <b>heating</b> <b>chamber</b> and a store room. There was room for these as the ground inclined rapidly to the west, and the chancel above was raised by seven steps. The Huddersfield Chronicle described the 1886 plans for the interior thus: [...] "Internally the roofs and chancel arch are somewhat striking, owing to the wide span and heavy timbers which will be used, but all details such as the windows and open benches are very plainly drawn. The east window will be of three long lancet lights, ad here is an opportunity for a display of stained glass, which would be a decoration of great value to the interior of the building[...] Seats are to be provided for 422 adults and 112 children" [...] At the consecration, the accommodation was described as [...] "500 adults." [...] The cost was estimated in 1886 at £3,250 (...) [...] Messrs B. Graham and Nephew of Mold Green, Kirkheaton contracted for the excavators, masons, carpenters and joiners' work. George Garton contracted for the plumbers and glaziers; Mr Jowitt contracted for the slaters and plasterers; and S. Kendall contracted for the painters. Mr Calvert made the heating apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat shrink tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented <b>heat</b> <b>chamber</b> on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two <b>heat</b> guns. The <b>chamber</b> design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber</b> along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber.</b> A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R

50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a <b>heating</b> <b>chamber</b> {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the heating assembly is secured. Inside the <b>heating</b> <b>chamber,</b> multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of their duties, firefighters risk heat stroke and other medical {{conditions}} due to exertion in high-temperature environments. Infrared tympanic temperature measurement (TTym) is often used by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to assess the core body temperature of firefighters. The accuracy of TTym in this setting has been called into question. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of TTym for core body temperature assessment at emergency firefighting events compared with gastrointestinal temperature measurement (TGI) as measured by ingestible thermometers. Forty-five (42 male, three female) professional urban firefighters from an Australian fire service completed two 20 -minute work periods in a 100 °C (± 5 °C) <b>heat</b> <b>chamber</b> while wearing personal protective clothing (PPC) and breathing apparatus (weighing approximately 22 kg). Measurements were taken immediately before entering, and on exiting, the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber.</b> Tympanic temperature was assessed by an infrared tympanic thermometer and TGI was measured by ingestible sensor and radio receiver. Complete data were available for 37 participants. Participant temperatures were higher on exiting the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber</b> than at baseline (TTym: 35. 9 °C (SD= 0. 7) vs 37. 5 °C (SD= 0. 8); TGI: 37. 2 °C (SD= 0. 4) vs 38. 6 °C (SD= 0. 5)). Tympanic temperature underestimated TGI on average by 1. 3 °C (SD= 0. 5) before entering the chamber and by 1. 0 °C (SD= 0. 8) following the exercise. Using pooled data, the average underestimation was 1. 2 °C (SD= 0. 7). Tympanic thermometers cause an unreliable measure of core body temperature for firefighters engaged in fire suppression activities. Accurate and practical measures of core body temperature are required urgently...|$|R
50|$|The {{halogen lamp}} {{is turned on}} and off by a simple {{thermostat}} or electronic control and generates waves of infrared light to heat the air within the <b>heating</b> <b>chamber.</b> The fan then circulates this heated air throughout the chamber to evenly cook {{the contents of the}} bowl through convective heat transfer, or convection.

Pot still distillation gives an incomplete separation, but this can be desirable for the flavor of some distilled beverages.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of severe extreme thermal stress on the respiratory rate (panting) of unsheared and sheared rams in standing and lying position, and to analyse two temperature-humidity indices (THIs). Six mature Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia, three unshorn and three shorn, were subjected to 40 hours (8 hours each day for five days) of gradual increase in temperature from 25 °C to 40 °C, guaranteeing 4 h daily at 40 °C in a <b>heat</b> <b>chamber.</b> Respiratory rate (RR) was registered continuously by counting flank movements, and the ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded every five minutes inside the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber.</b> From 1413 RR measurements, descriptive and modelling analyses were performed. Panting as a response variable was distributed into five categories, and fixed effects such as THI, wool (unshorn/shorn), and position (standing/lying) were considered. No significant differences were observed between the panting score in the unshorn (standing or lying) and standing (unshorn or shorn) sheep, but significant differences were observed in shorn and lying rams. The explanations could be that heat production from muscle activity was lower and the transfer and heat lost by conduction to the floor was easier in the rams with shorter fleece (at least 0. 7 inches long). However, in the unshorn rams, their wool acted as an insulator, both with air as well as the floor. Australian Merino rams from Northern Patagonia are heat tolerant to an environment between 31. 5 °C and 42 °C, and 32 % to 48 % humidity for 40 hours over five days. The rams were in the first phase of panting, and the normal rectal temperatures registered daily when leaving the <b>heat</b> <b>chamber</b> confirmed that regulation of body temperature was possible. The LPHSI’s THI was adjusted to improve the analysis of the RR more than the National Research Council’s THI...|$|R
