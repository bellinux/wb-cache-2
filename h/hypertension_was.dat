25|$|Imatinib was {{initially}} {{thought to have}} a potential role {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension.

Throat swab was conducted, but he died on 10 August due to severe pneumonia. Lab result confirmed he had Influenza A(H1N1) on the next day, making {{him one of the}} victims of the flu. A 37-year-old diabetic woman was hospitalised after showing symptoms. She was later given antiviral drugs but died on 10 August. A 69-year-old woman who had history of <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> found to have been coughing. Throat swab was conducted after she was transferred to ICU due to suffocation. On 11 August 2009, she died due to acute myocarditis. A woman in her 20s, who also had a history of congenital disease, started to have fever and coughing on 6 August. She was later admitted and given antiviral drugs on 8 August. However, she died on 10 August due to severe bronchopneumonia. A 4-year-old boy who had congenital disease was treated on 2 August after exhibiting symptoms of the flu. He was later confirmed to have the flu after throat swab was taken, however, he died before the confirmation. A 92-year-old lady who had asthma and a 43-year-old man who had diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases died on 11 August 2009 due to severe pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or chlorpheniramine. Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When {{he ran out of}} his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the [...] "de-challenge" [...] and [...] "re-challenge" [...] that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.|$|E

2500|$|Pathophysiology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which explains {{the function of the}} body as it relates to diseases and conditions. The pathophysiology of <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> an area which attempts to explain mechanistically the causes of <b>hypertension,</b> which <b>is</b> a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. <b>Hypertension</b> can <b>be</b> classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90–95% of <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> essential <b>hypertension.</b> [...] Some authorities define essential hypertension as that which has no known explanation, while others define its cause as being due to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of potassium. Secondary hypertension indicates that the <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> a result of a specific underlying condition with a well-known mechanism, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the aorta or kidney arteries, or endocrine disorders such as excess aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines. Persistent <b>hypertension</b> <b>is</b> a major risk factor for hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{essential}} hypertension ('Essentielle Hypertonie') was coined by Eberhard Frank in 1911 to describe elevated blood pressure {{for which no}} cause could be found. In 1928, the term malignant <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> coined by physicians from the Mayo Clinic to describe a syndrome of very high blood pressure, severe retinopathy and adequate kidney function which usually resulted in death within a year from strokes, heart failure or kidney failure. A prominent individual with severe <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, while the menace of severe or malignant <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> well recognised, the risks of more moderate elevations of blood pressure were uncertain {{and the benefits of}} treatment doubtful. Consequently, <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> often classified into [...] "malignant" [...] and [...] "benign". In 1931, John Hay, Professor of Medicine at Liverpool University, wrote that [...] "there is some truth in the saying that the greatest danger to a man with a high blood pressure lies in its discovery, because then some fool is certain to try and reduce it". This view was echoed by the eminent US cardiologist Paul Dudley White in 1937, who suggested that [...] "hypertension may be an important compensatory mechanism which should not be tampered with, even if we were certain that we could control it". Charles Friedberg's 1949 classic textbook [...] "Diseases of the Heart", stated that [...] "people with 'mild benign' hypertension ... as blood pressures up to levels of 210/100 mm Hg ... need not be treated". However the tide of medical opinion was turning: it was increasingly recognised in the 1950s that [...] "benign" [...] <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> not harmless. Over the next decade increasing evidence accumulated from actuarial reports and longitudinal studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, that [...] "benign" [...] hypertension increased death and cardiovascular disease, and that these risks increased in a graded manner with increasing blood pressure across the whole spectrum of population blood pressures. Subsequently, the National Institutes of Health also sponsored other population studies, which additionally showed that African Americans had a higher burden of hypertension and its complications.|$|E
