25|$|The {{cycle is}} a work of {{extraordinary}} scale. Perhaps the most outstanding facet of the monumental work is its sheer length: a <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the conductor's pacing. The first and shortest work, Das Rheingold, typically lasts two and a half hours, while the final and longest, Götterdämmerung, takes up to five hours, excluding intervals.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> of an obligation.|$|E

25|$|By the 1820s, Gluckian {{influence}} in France {{had given way}} to a taste for Italian bel canto, especially after the arrival of Rossini in Paris. Rossini's Guillaume Tell helped found the new genre of Grand Opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer's works, such as Les Huguenots emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter opéra comique also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of Boïeldieu, Auber, Hérold and Adolphe Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece Les Troyens, the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> for almost a hundred years.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} period, Soviet {{military}} engineer P. K. Oshchepkov, {{in collaboration with}} Leningrad Electrophysical Institute, produced an experimental apparatus, RAPID, capable of detecting an aircraft within 3km of a receiver. The Soviets produced their first mass production radars RUS-1 and RUS-2 Redut in 1939 but further development was slowed following the arrest of Oshchepkov and his subsequent gulag sentence. In total, only 607 Redut stations were produced during the war. The first Russian airborne radar, Gneiss-2, entered into service in June 1943 on Pe-2 fighters. More than 230 Gneiss-2 stations were produced {{by the end of}} 1944. The French and Soviet systems, however, featured continuous-wave operation that did not provide the <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> ultimately synonymous with modern radar systems.|$|E
25|$|One major {{advantage}} of the new design was its larger fuel capacity, {{which has been a}} major problem for the original FD2. The Delta 2 had often run out of fuel while still accelerating, thereby never reaching its <b>full</b> <b>performance.</b> The modifications for the 221 meant it was not capable of the same levels of performance; however, speeds of Mach 1.6 were attained during its test flights. In total, the BAC 221 featured a new wing, engine inlet configuration, a Rolls-Royce Avon RA.28, modified vertical stabilizer and a lengthened undercarriage to mimic Concorde's attitude on the ground. It first flew in this form on 1 May 1964. The sole 221 was used for various test flight conducted from 1964 until 1973, after which the aircraft was soon after preserved and placed on public display.|$|E

500|$|Flight testing {{proved that}} {{performance}} estimates were accurate {{and that even}} when fitted with the low powered J65 engine, the XF-104 flew faster than the other Century Series fighters being developed at the time. The XF-104's ceiling at [...] was [...] higher than predicted, and it exceeded estimated speed and drag figures by two to three percent. It was noted however that the low thrust of the J65 engine did not enable the <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> potential of the type to be realized.|$|E
500|$|Innovations {{include a}} new system for {{lighting}} massive areas like Pandora's jungle, a motion-capture stage or [...] "volume" [...] six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made [...] fitted with a tiny camera positioned {{in front of the}} actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers. According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.|$|E
500|$|One idea under early {{consideration}} was {{to include}} a mini-set at each stop, containing a <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> of one of Springsteen's classic albums. [...] Van Zandt predicted that they would play most of Working on a Dream during {{the initial stages of}} the tour, but {{what the rest of the}} show would be was uncertain. If the full album idea did go forward, he thought 1980's double album The River combined with outtakes from those sessions would make a full show on its own. [...] Nothing came of the full album notion right away; it would have to wait until the tour's U.S. third leg to materialize.|$|E

500|$|Wagner did not resume work on Parsifal {{for eight}} years, {{during which time}} he {{completed}} Tristan und Isolde and began Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up Parsifal again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and {{a considerable amount of}} detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the Ring cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first <b>full</b> <b>performance</b> at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on Parsifal.
