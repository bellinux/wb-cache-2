5|$|Between {{then and}} the late 1940s these two {{estimates}} were commonly cited by reporters and the media. For example, Edgar Snow stated in his 1941 book, The Battle for Asia, that 42,000 were massacred in Nanking and 300,000 in total between Nanking and Shanghai, figures which were apparently based on these <b>estimates.</b> <b>The</b> 1944 film, The Battle of China, stated that 40,000 {{were killed in the}} Nanking Massacre.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Ikuhiko Hata also {{examined}} the Japanese Army's documents and tallied up {{a total of}} 30,000 Chinese POWs massacred {{out of a total}} Chinese force of 100,000. Hata takes Smythe's figure of 12,000 civilians killed, but notes that perhaps only 8,000 were confirmed massacre victims. Hata discounts estimates of the death toll which range into the hundreds of thousands on the basis that, according to Smythe, Nanking's civilian population was only between 200,000 and 250,000. In light of the 40,000 corpses which Hata believes were buried in and around Nanking, he <b>estimates</b> <b>the</b> total death toll at between 38,000 and 42,000 POWs and civilians.|$|E
