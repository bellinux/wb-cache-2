Such cross-licensing deals {{have traditionally}} raised antitrust concerns, since {{they can be}} used to control market shares and prices, and create entry barriers. We argue that cross-licensing is a device to establish multimarket contact and is likely to raise antitrust concerns only in so far as multimarket contact does. Since cross-licensing typically occurs between similar firms in similar markets it is, as a first approximation, irrelevant for sustaining tacit collusion. We also point out the importance of incorporating the incentive to innovate into the analysis of the subtle relation between intellectual property and competition policies.

40|$|The {{question}} of how prices on patents rights should be determined in impersonal exchanges is examined in a laboratory environment. Dynamic gains from such organized trade with public prices are recorded. The experiment introduces a competitive market with impersonal exchange mechanisms and prices in the traditionally hierarchical and personal <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> A tradable linear contract (fixed fee plus royalty) is investigated with three mechanism designs for demand-side bidding and two levels of presumed legal validity of the underlying patent. A "trader" can split contracts useful for multiple "industries," creating dynamic gains, potentially increasing {{the use of technology}} in the economic system. Previous research on licensing has mostly been limited to one-dimensional auction mechanisms or static environments. The results indicate that agents appear to price the blocking value in the fixed fee and the investment value, net what is paid in fixed, in the royalty component, supporting a proposed theory of prices. Risks are thereby shifted from the invention to the consumer by means of this producer market, increasing the incentives for investment in invention, potentially resulting in a more competitive technology being developed and a more efficient economic system. The results give indications on proper integration of information and rules for mechanisms for organized market on patents with transparent prices. It also shows that intermediaries (traders) are critical to achieve dynamic gains from the system as are high presumed validity of patents. patents, trade, licensing, intellectual property, experiments...|$|E

The longer run downward trend in patents per R&D dollar is interpreted not as an indication of diminishing returns but rather as a reflection of the changing meaning of such data over time. The conclusion is reached that, in spite of many difficulties and reservations, patent data remain a unique resource for the study of technical change. ...|$|R

40|$|Innovation {{has become}} the {{dominant}} economic idea of our time and {{has resulted in a}} proliferation of innovation-oriented rhetoric, and policies. There is a great need to understand and harness innovation, but it has proven to be as difficult to measure as it is to define. At present, the quest to understand innovation hinges on finding reliable ways to identify and measure it, the most promising of which is the analysis <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> information. Patents have been increasingly used by economists to track inventiveness, the transmission of knowledge, and their economic impact. However, it is evident that the maiority <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> have little or no economic potential, and so merely observing the number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> provides little insight on innovation. It has become important, therefore, to develop reliable methods for measuring the true economic potential <b>of</b> <b>patents.</b> <b>Of</b> all the solutions proposed, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> citations is the most promising. This study examines the relationship between patent citations and the private economic value <b>of</b> <b>patents,</b> and makes both theoretical and empirical contributions. (cont.) First, the previous literature is reviewed to further extend and clarify the theory of the economic meaning <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> citations. Second, a typology <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> value is proposed to contextualize the relevance of the theory under different appropriation regimes. Finally, this study tests the economic meaning of citations using a new dataset where the licensing value of a group <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> is observed directly.
