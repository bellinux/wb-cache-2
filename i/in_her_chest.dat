5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E
500|$|Her nanny, {{who called}} Elisabeth [...] "my baby," [...] woke Elisabeth {{in the middle}} of the night and settled her in a window seat of the nursery so that she might look out on the game spread out upon the grounds below. One morning, the eight-year-old awoke with a sore throat and pains <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much {{excitement}} with her cousins the previous day. Her fever rose to 104 degrees. The imperial party didn't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned. By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started gasping for breath. A specialist was summoned from Warsaw. The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart, but without success.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
500|$|Taking {{place an}} unknown {{length of time}} after the events of Mother 2, Mother 3 story is told in eight chapters, {{including}} a prologue. The game begins with twins Lucas and Claus, and their mother Hinawa visiting her father, who lives up in the mountains. The kids spend their time playing with friendly dinosaur creatures called Dragos. Their home village, Tazmily, is a quiet small town that does not utilize any form of currency. Shortly after Flint, Hinawa's husband, receives a letter from Hinawa, the Pig Mask Army starts a forest fire and invades Tazmily Village, {{a small town in}} the Nowhere Islands. [...] Flint quickly arrives to help others deal with the fire, but later realizes his family has not yet returned from visiting Hinawa's father. When Hinawa is found dead due to a Drago fang <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> Flint lashes out in anger and is imprisoned. Claus sneaks Flint a tool to escape before running off to find the Drago responsible for Hinawa's death. Flint sets out to find Claus. In chapter two, neophyte thief Duster breaks into a castle to find an egg that keeps the world's secrets. He meets the princess Kumatora, but they are separated when a flood washes them out of the castle. In chapter three, Pig Mask leader Fassad orders the monkey player-character, Salsa, through the desert. Salsa escapes to the forest and futilely fights the Pig Mask Army with Kumatora until Lucas saves them by summoning friendly Dragos. Lucas and Flint protect the town while Kumatora and Salsa look for Duster. In chapter four, three years have passed, Tazmily has been modernized, and Lucas becomes the game's main protagonist. Lucas learns psychic powers from a superpowered, benevolent, cross-dressing creature known as a Magypsy and recovers the amnesic Duster from life as a bandmate.|$|E
2500|$|On June 21, 1920, Wanderer and {{his wife}} were {{returning}} home from the Pershing Theater in Lincoln Square when shots rang out in the hallway of the Johnson apartment. Ruth's mother heard the shots and rushed to the scene, finding Wanderer pummeling the body of a man in ragged clothing with his gun. Ruth lay dying with several shots <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> and reportedly said [...] "My baby is dead" [...] before dying. According to Wanderer's account, the man had been tailing them and followed them into the vestibule of their apartment, presumably to rob them, and Wanderer drew his military service pistol—a Colt M1911—and exchanged fire with the intruder. Wanderer killed the assailant, but his wife was killed by the shooter, who was not immediately identified.|$|E

2500|$|Blannbekin {{described}} {{herself as}} continually beset with visions throughout the day, which she described as imber lacrimarum, or a [...] "rain of tears" [...] from God. Many of these visions involved bright lights, {{and in one}} she described being [...] "so filled with light within that she could gaze at herself." [...] As with the foreskin occasion, many of her visions involved touch, such as being kissed on the cheeks by the Lamb of God. While eating the Eucharist, Blannbekin claimed to taste Christ; on one occasion, a sexually immoral priest could not find his Eucharist, which Blannbekin claimed to have felt in her own mouth. Similarly, she described drinking a [...] "refreshing spiritual drink" [...] from the spear wound of Jesus. Supposed visitations from Jesus himself caused an orgastic reaction: [...] "Agnes herself was filled with an excitement <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> every time that God visited her that was so intense that it went through her body and that it burned as a result, not in a painful but in a most pleasurable manner." ...|$|E

60|$|Dearest Sarianna,--Robert {{will have}} told you {{of the success of}} our journey, which the necessities of Mr. Landor very nearly pushed back into the cold too late. We had even {{resolved}} that if the wind changed before morning we would accept it 'as a sign' and altogether give up Rome. We were all but run to ground, you see. Happily it didn't end so; and here we are in a very nice sunny apartment, which would have been far beyond our means last year or any year except just now when the Pope's obstinacy and the rumoured departure of the French have left Rome a solitude and called it peace--very problematical peace. (Peni, in despair at leaving Florence, urged on us that 'for mama to have cold air <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> would be better than to have a cannon-ball in her stomach'; but she was unreasonably more afraid of one than of the other.) Apartments here for which friends of ours paid forty pounds English the month last winter are going for fifteen or under--or rather not going--for nobody scarcely comes to take them. The Pope's 'reforms' seem to be limited, in spite of his alarming position, which is breaking his heart, he told a friend of Mrs. Stowe's the other day, and out of which he looks to be relieved only by some special miracle (the American was quite affected to hear the old man bewail himself!), to an edict against crinolines, the same being forbidden to sweep the sacred pavement of St. Peter's. This is true, though it sounds like a joke.|$|E
6000|$|By long {{observation}} I have understood, That {{two little}} vermin are kin to Will Wood. The first is an insect {{they call a}} wood-louse, That folds up itself in itself for a house, As round as a ball, without head, without tail, Enclosed cap à pie, in a strong coat of mail. And thus William Wood to my fancy appears In fillets of brass roll'd up to his ears; And over these fillets he wisely has thrown, To keep out of danger, a doublet of stone.[1] The louse of the wood for a medicine is used Or swallow'd alive, or skilfully bruised. And, let but our mother Hibernia contrive To swallow Will Wood, either bruised or alive, She need be no more with the jaundice possest, Or sick of obstructions, and pains <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] The next is an insect we call a wood-worm, That lies in old wood like a hare in her form; With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch, And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch; Because like a watch it always cries click; Then woe be {{to those in the}} house who are sick: For, as sure as a gun, they will give up the ghost, If the maggot cries click when it scratches the post; But a kettle of scalding hot-water injected Infallibly cures the timber affected; The omen is broken, the danger is over; The maggot will die, and the sick will recover. Such a worm was Will Wood, when he scratch'd at the door Of a governing statesman or favourite whore; The death of our nation he seem'd to foretell, And the sound of his brass we took for our knell. But now, since the Drapier has heartily maul'd him, I think the best {{thing we can do is}} to scald him; For which operation there's nothing more proper Than the liquor he deals in, his own melted copper; Unless, like the Dutch, you rather would boil This coiner of raps[2] in a caldron of oil. Then choose which you please, and let each bring a fagot, For our fear's at an end with the death of the maggot.|$|E
