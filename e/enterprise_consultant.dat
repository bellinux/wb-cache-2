30|$|However {{the answers}} to the {{questions}} ‘Why do these failure factors emerge in most of the ES projects?’ and ‘What remedies can be applied to compromise the most prominent risk factors?’ are not usually answered. Furthermore, all of the research cited above presents the risk factors from the perspective of an adopting organisation, while a typical project landscape consists of three parties (Haines and Goodhue 2003): the adopting organisation (implementer, client), the system vendor, and the consulting <b>enterprise</b> (<b>consultant)</b> that helps the adopting organisation to implement the system successfully. For a description of the role of consultants in the implementation of an Enterprise System project, see Lech (2013 b). Therefore, it is a promising research direction to investigate the failure factors in more detail and to present a perspective other than that of the adopting organisation. This study investigated the causes of the dominant risk factors and proposed remedies for those risk factors {{from the perspective of the}} implementation consultants involved in ES projects.|$|E

Based on study, suggestions for social enterprises to achieve long term development are exhibited.   Method: This research is a qualitative research based on case study. Relay on previous knowledge about social enterprises, I formulate questions which serve my study’s aim. There are three companies be selected {{in my case}} company list. Those three companies are divided in two categories: one type is social <b>enterprise</b> <b>consultant</b> company whose mission is to aid regional social enterprise to make health business operation; another type is social enterprise. There are four interview used in the research {{to ensure that the}} research result contains different perspectives and opinions.   Result & Conclusions: This study depicts an overall view about social enterprise business expansion. Certain suggestions have been listed relay on the combination of previous literature result with case studies. In the study, various elements have been determined which have significant impacts on social enterprise business expansion operation. They are divided in two segments, internal and external. Internal aspects include human resource and social entrepreneur. External factors include third Part Company, non-profit charity groups and authority. Social enterprise who wants business expansion needs to integrate different resources from various social institutions. Meanwhile to enhance internal product capability as well as competitive advantage social enterprise needs to more emphasize on social entrepreneurs’ characteristics.   Suggestion for further research: Further study should emphasize on various sizes of social enterprises in multi-stakeholders co-operation model. This study mainly focuses on SMEs type of SE, but with the time passing by, due to SE can offer solutions to social crisis and economic crisis, SE will be popular, and this idea will spread quickly. Therefore, more and more large size SE will emerge which needs guide and help with business maintaining and expansion plans.   Contribution of the thesis: This study contributes to three aspects. First, this study analyses the present situation of social enterprise, exhibit internal and external factors which affect social enterprise to make business expansion. It offers social enterprise a path to implement business expansion, and help social enterprise to identify its potential capabilities which could help them achieve long term development. Secondly, during this work, author explains the ideology of social enterprise, what are its contributions to society as well as the reason why it exists. Since the results offer an explicitly structured conclusion, they are valuable information to society as well as local municipality to re-considerate the important role social enterprise can play. Last not the least, this research presents a new model of key elements for social enterprise business expansion. It is critical and crucial for further research in academic study. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{performance}} evolution of enterprises in Italian industrial districts. In particular, economic performance indicators are analysed for Arezzo goldsmith enterprises, to highlight: differences in the goldsmith local systems performances; the role played by firm size in the evolution trajectories; and the emergence of a medium-sized nucleus of firms with better performance. Design/methodology/approach – The paper first conducts a brief literature review on medium-sized firms in Italian industrial districts. Then it examines the economic-financial indicators of 183 Arezzo goldsmith firms to evaluate firm performance in comparative terms both with other Italian industrial districts and with firm size. Finally it focuses its attention on 15 medium-sized firms or groups, carrying out a statistical analysis by organizational model comparing the aggregate data of the Arezzo goldsmith district. Findings – The results regarding the Arezzo experience show: a reduction of competitive capabilities compared with other industrial districts; considerable difficulties for both small enterprises and the historical large firm leader; and the emergence of a medium-sized firm nucleus which seems better able to manage a changing competitive environment. Research limitations/implications – The main implication for researchers and SME (small to medium-sized <b>enterprises)</b> <b>consultants</b> is that the selection process currently in play among Italian industrial districts and local enterprises appears to reward only certain entrepreneurial categories. Findings of this exploratory study need future research both at an inter-industry level and with international comparative analysis.

Up to 90 percent of formal businesses in South Africa {{are classified as}} small and medium sized enterprises. Therefore, {{the success of these}} enterprises is of significance to the South African economy. The formation of strategy is mostly associated with large corporate enterprises, which have the required resources in respect of finance, time and skills, to expend in forming and implementing strategies that are aimed at long term success. These resources are typically not easily accessible to small and medium enterprises, whose focus is mostly on the day to day operation (or even survival) of the enterprise. This qualitative study explores the views, experiences, knowledge and perceptions of 12 small and medium enterprise research participants in respect of important aspects relating to strategy. These aspects include the role-players in strategy formation, forecasting and planning practices, the type of competitive intelligence gathered, the use of consultants and the link between strategy and the performance of small and medium enterprises. These aspects are all considered, in order to obtain an understanding of the main theme of the study, which focuses on determining the extent to which small and medium <b>enterprise</b> use <b>consultants</b> for the formation of strategy.

40|$|Although {{there are}} already some {{qualification}} offers available for enterprises to support resource efficiency innovations, the high potentials that can be identified especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have not been activated until now. As successful change lies {{in the hands of}} humans, the main aim of vocational education has to be the promotion of organisational and cultural changes in the enterprises. As there is already a small but increasing number of enterprises that perform very well in resource efficiency innovations one question arises: What are typical characteristics of those enterprises? Leaning on a good-practice approach, the project "ResourceCulture" is going to prove or falsify the hypothesis that enterprises being successful with resource efficiency innovations have a specific culture of trust, which substantially contributes to innovation processes, or even initially enables them. Detailed empirical field research will light up which correlations between resource efficiency, innovation and cultures of trust can be found and will offer important aspects for the improvement of management instruments and qualification concepts for workplace training.

40|$|In the 1960 s and 1970 s the {{construction}} industry {{made an effort to}} develop shared knowledge and performance measurement tools within the industry. This effort ceased as the bigger enterprises began to see information generated at their companies as enterprise assets and competitive resources. In recent years, {{the construction}} industry has begun to acknowledge the importance of detailed planning and work preparation on construction sites. The fragmentation of the construction process, with increased specialisation and involvement of many interested parties and actors calls for a shared format for creating, converting, and exchanging knowledge. There is a need for better documentation and control of what is actually done on the construction site, and of how it is done. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss how knowledge about construction methods is created, converted, and shared in the Swedish construction sector. It examines past efforts to share information and how the efforts have developed over time. New initiatives are examined and analysed, looking at how well knowledge is managed and applied on construction sites. A web portal developed at Lund University (www. ByggAi. se) in close cooperation with {{the construction industry}} exemplifies a new initiative in this respect. The paper will also present end users’ analysis regarding the accessibility of information from the web portal. The web portal has a great potential to disseminate information to various actors: construction <b>enterprises,</b> manufacturers, <b>consultants,</b> and clients. The web portal has also developed to include other areas of interest, promoting issues such as health, safety, and ergonomics; energy-efficient buildings; energy-efficient construction work; and handling of moisture issues. The main advantage of the portal is its packaging of situational knowledge, so that workers at all levels can find all of the relevant information about specific construction methods before they begin work on the construction site. Moreover, the portal makes the information available on a “just-in-time” basis, so workers can continue to access it throughout the project, taking what they need to know at the time they need it.

40|$|Although {{many foreign}} {{invested}} <b>enterprises</b> (FIEs) and <b>consultants</b> in China put the localization to a strategic level, management localization {{is still an}} emerging issue of human resource management in academic research. A few previous studies on management localization focused on the internal efficiency of the subsidiaries or parent-subsidiary relationship. The impact of management localization on {{the interaction between the}} subsidiary and local environment has received little attention. Moreover, localization lacks a consistent and valid definition. This thesis attempts to bridge the gap by systematically exploring the strategic impact of management localization. Management localization is defined as substituting expatriate managers with local managers. Based on resource-based view, local managers can be considered the vehicle of local managerial resources and thus can bring competitive advantage to the subsidiary. It is hypothesized that the effect of the management localization on the performance of the subsidiaries is contingent on cultural distance, localization emphasis, resource dependence, and decision participation of the local managers. In-depth interviews in China help to illuminate the concept validity and definition of management localization, and the data from a questionnaire survey in China are used to test the hypotheses. The results of hierarchical regression analyses provide partial support for the contingent resource perspective. The findings have meaningful implications for management localization at the multinationals’ subsidiaries and provide strong heuristics for future studies of this issue...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years and up to date, many {{companies}} around the globe have implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Implementing ERP system in an organisation is considered as an irresistible challenge, with the typical ERP system implementation approach. In correspondent, management in an organisation are facing critical challenges' to make decision on a specific ERP system implementation strategy, however, any considered decision would influence development, testing and ultimately the success of the implementation. Therefore, this thesis aims to examine solution to how organisation can decide or choose the best ERP system implementation strategy and explore the one that could be highly recommended by considering <b>enterprise</b> and <b>consultant</b> perspectives.   In order to accomplish the purpose of this thesis, qualitative and quantitative method of collecting and analysing data were adopted. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the mean of questionnaire and structure interview. This {{is one of the reasons}} why this thesis can be viewed in an inductive and deductive approaches. To this end, exploratory and descriptive knowledge should be derived from this study. Analysis of this thesis has discovered that, there are many influencing factors in which organisation needed to be considered when making choice of a particular ERP system implementation strategy. These factors include: (i) Size and Complexity of an organisation (ii) Degree of internationalisation (iii) Number of requirements (iv) Nature of integration and (v) Skills and Experience of people within an organisation. In order to choose appropriate strategy for ERP system implementation, organisation should considered to implement a skeleton system in which other application can be added to the systems when it is in operation. Clarification of a business vision that would call for the legacy system replacement or re-modification, is also essential for an organisation to consider. Considering the above statements, organisation should be able to choose appropriate strategy that would fit their business processes. Nevertheless, Phased strategy is considered as the best or appropriate implementation strategy in which organisation can rely upon. Exploring Phased strategy simply means that, the problem of making choice of a particular implementation strategy will be minimal. That is; organisations that are willing to implement ERP system can easily consider phased strategy as their best alternative in order to attain success implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Norah and Fred Fisher welcomed John Fisher {{into the}} world on November 29, 1912, not knowing what an {{influential}} role he would play in shaping Canada's history. John Fisher grew up as the middle child of five {{brothers and sisters in}} Frosty Hollow, New Brunswick, close to today’s town of Sackville. Sackville’s main industry was the Enterprise Foundry which the Fisher family owned and operated; however, Fisher had no plans of going into the family business. He was more inspired by his maternal grandfather, Dr. Cecil Wiggins, who lived with the family after retiring from the Anglican ministry. Wiggins encouraged all his grandchildren to be well read and to take part in discussions on current events. There were often visitors in the Fisher household taking part in discussions about politics, religion, and daily life. Fisher forced himself to take part in these conversations to help overcome his shyness in social settings. These conversations did help with his shyness and also in forming many opinions and observations about Canada. It put Fisher on the road to becoming Mr. Canada and delivering the many eloquent speeches for which he was known. Fisher did not venture far from home to complete his first degree. In 1934 he graduated from Mount Allison University in Sackville, NB with an Arts degree. The same year Fisher enrolled in Dalhousie’s law school. During his time at Dalhousie, Fisher discovered radio through Hugh Mills. Mills or “Uncle Mel” was on CHNS, Halifax’s only radio station at the time. Fisher began by making appearences on the radio drama show. By 1941 he had begun writing and broadcasting his own works and joined the staff as an announcer and continuity writer. In 1936 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was formed, the first National radio station. Fisher joined the CBC shortly after it’s beginning and remained with them, as well as the Halifax Herald newspaper, even after his law school graduation in 1937. By 1943 Fisher’s talks became a part of the CBC’s programming for a group of maritime radio stations. Fisher once described his talks as follows “my talks weren’t meant to be objective... they were meant to be favourable. They were ‘pride builders’” He began his famed John Fisher Reports at CBC Toronto when he transfered there shortly after the war. This program brought emmence pride to the fellow Canadians he spoke about leading to approximately 3500 requests per year to speak at banquets and meeting throughout Canada and the United States. Fisher was a well travelled indivdual who would draw on personal experiences to connect with his audience. His stories were told in simple, straight forward language for anyone to enjoy. He became a smooth, dynamic and passionate speaker who sold Canada to Canadians. He became a renowned journalist, folk historian, writer and broadcaster. Fisher was able to reach a vast array of people through his radio work and build Canadian pride, but he did not stop there. Other ways Fisher has contributed to Canada and the Canadian people include: Honoured by five Canadian Universities. 1956, became the Director of the Canadian Tourist Association. 1961, was appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister of Canada. 1963, Commissioner of the Centennial Commission (the Federal Agency Responsible for Canada’s 100 th birthday) 1968, received the Service Medal, a coveted Order of Canada. President of John Fisher <b>Enterprises</b> Ltd., private <b>consultant</b> work, specializing in Centennial planning, broadcasts, lectures and promotion.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{has established a}} new measurement model for User Empowerment as an enabler to Enterprise Systems 1 success. This study {{was inspired by the}} reported relationship between Empowerment and improved work outcomes. From this, it was hypothesised that empowering the users of Enterprise Systems during the implementation process would improve the reports of post implementation system success. A new related concept of system oriented User Empowerment was conceived. The outcomes of empowering users (increased worker effectiveness; (increased work satisfaction) conceptually resonates very closely to the outcomes of individual performance, quality of system outputs, goodness of system functionality and, on a broader level, effective use of the system to yield successful business outcomes. These latter outcomes represent the measures of Enterprise Systems success. Thus Empowerment as an independent variable, and Enterprise Systems success as a dependent variable, provided a launching platform for the study. The research model was built upon the existing research into Empowerment as articulated by Spreitzer (Spreitzer, 1996) and Thomas and Velthouse (Thomas & Velthouse, 1990) and its derived systems related construct of User Empowerment, first explored by Doll, Deng and Metts (Doll, Deng, & Metts, 2003). It used a current and validated measure of Enterprise Systems Success as developed by Gable, Sedera and Chan (Gable, Sedera, & Chan, 2003); this measure is a refinement of the Information Systems Success Model of DeLone and McLean (DeLone & McLean, 2002). 2 In order to test the relationships of Empowerment to (Enterprise) System success, the following research sub-problems were explored: *	What types of Empowerment are relevant in the Enterprise System context? *	Is User Empowerment different from Psychological Empowerment and if so, how? *	What is the relationship between Psychological Empowerment and User Empowerment? *	How can User Empowerment be measured? *	What is the effect of Psychological Empowerment on Enterprise Systems success? *	What is the effect of User Empowerment on Enterprise Systems success? This {{research project}} was a PhD study funded by the Australian Research Council through an industry linkage program. The industry partner in this project was SAP - the most successful vendor of Enterprise Systems. Although limited in analysis the study spanned across two industry sectors, with two Enterprise Systems (Oracle and SAP). This research was a multimethod study and involved both qualitative and quantitative phases. The multimethod included content analysis, survey, and case study. This research was led by an explorative research strategy and paid considerable attention to analysing each research method in relation to other research methods, and also in relation {{to the demands of the}} research problem. A comprehensive literature review established extant definitions and constructs for Psychological Empowerment, User Empowerment and, Enterprise Systems success. The literature review employed a formal qualitative research method, using open coding supported through the use of Nvivo, a Qualitative software package, in order to identify and derive key themes in the referent disciplines. The responses from the email survey of Information Systems researchers, and <b>Enterprise</b> Systems <b>consultants</b> were triangulated with the findings from the categorised literature review on Empowerment. This sub-study utilised WordStat software and the findings were presented at the QualIT conference (Sehgal & Stewart, 2006). Drawing from the existing perspectives on Empowerment a contextbased perspective on Empowerment was proposed by the researcher. From this work, a new working definition of (User) Empowerment was derived. This construct proposed that User Empowerment involved Computer Self-efficacy, Perceived Usefulness, Intrinsic Motivation, User Autonomy, and Problem-solving and Decision support. Psychological Empowerment involves Meaning, Self-determination, Competence, and Impact. The research project then empirically tested the relationship of both Psychological Empowerment and User Empowerment to Enterprise Systems success using a quantitative enquiry. The new User Empowerment construct was statistically tested for validity and reliability. This quantitative study found no statistical evidence for a relationship between Psychological Empowerment and Enterprise Systems success. The study findings suggest significant statistical evidence for a relationship between User Empowerment and Enterprise Systems success. Statistical analysis showed that the construct for User Empowerment was different from the construct of Enterprise Systems success. These relationships held regardless of the level of the user: senior management, operational, end users or technical. This phase of the study was presented at the Americas Conference of Information Systems (Sehgal & Stewart, 2004). This exploratory survey was followed by another industry based case study, which confirmed the results for a different industry sector and different Enterprise System. This latter study was used in an independent confirmatory factor analysis of the Enterprise Systems success measurement which was presented at the Americas Conference on Information Systems (Sehgal & Stewart, 2004) and International Conference on Information Systems (Sedera, Gable, & Chan, 2004) by fellow researchers. This research has demonstrated that User Empowerment, rather than Psychological Empowerment was significantly related to Enterprise Systems Success. The study findings identified potentially significant benefits to the Enterprise System implementing organisations as well as the Enterprise System vendor from empowering Enterprise System users. Of the reported benefits one of the relevant one was improved and positive reports about the implemented Enterprise System. Further, the study highlights the importance of context when measuring a construct such as Empowerment. There are clear practical implications for the research outcomes. These include a recommendation that training programs should ensure that users have a high degree of computer self-efficacy when using the enterprise system. The validated User Empowerment instrument will be utilised as a diagnostic tool for organisational readiness prior to an ES implementation. This would assist in benchmarking the level of empowerment and predicted Enterprise Systems success. Future research will explore the effects of an Enterprise System on the components of User Empowerment as it is conjectured that there is a reciprocal relationship between the system and user attributes of Computer Self-efficacy, Problem-solving Decision Support, and understanding of business logic...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The article {{highlights}} main {{demands and}} levels of realization of consumer cooperatives trade enterprises` diagnostics. We demonstrate the chain of marketing diagnostics; we offer the model of diagnostics process of marketing problems (opportunities) of cooperative trade enterprises. The results of the analysis. Marketing diagnostics {{is one of the}} marketing researches directions, which is matching of the researched object characteristics with comparison base for definition of objects quality condition (its diagnosis). In the context of our research marketing diagnostics should be considered as separate technological module which enables to form development backgrounds of competitive marketing strategies of consumer cooperatives trade enterprises according to conditions of inner and outer environment. We consider the following demands of marketing diagnostics conduction of consumer cooperatives trade enterprises: authenticity, objectivity, accuracy, resultativity, systematicness, sequence, scientific foundation, flexibility, timeliness, effectiveness, validity. Strategic diagnostics is the direction of researches that is responsible for receiving the information, necessary for further functioning of the enterprise. We should refer to comparative researches of strategic state of enterprise economy portfolio, enterprise competitiveness estimation, and enterprise activity threats and possibilities definition. Tactical diagnostics is the researches direction which forms information for plans programs development. Economy interest matching of marketing activity participants in this situation gains special meaning. Due to this meaning the procedures of their sequence can be developed. We consider the mentioned type of diagnostics to be insufficiently researched nowadays, though it has significant importance in the process of managerial decisions supporting and making. The main task of operative diagnostics is defining deviation borders of enterprise functioning from planned target parameters. Methods of marketing diagnostics are: calculative (methods of comparison, organization and modeling) and heuristic (methods of estimation, searching-estimation). Diagnostics can be conducted by administration and <b>enterprise</b> workers, outer <b>consultants,</b> mixed groups of experts inner and outer specialists in combination. Outer consultants attraction necessity appears while unforeseen, untypical situations in consumer cooperatives trade enterprises functioning. Marketing diagnostics which involves local specialists must be constant component in enterprises activities. The author of the article offers to conduct the chain of marketing diagnostics due to the following stages: interviewing of experts and staff; secondary information analysis; immediate contact with marketing diagnostics objects; preparing analytical information about marketing diagnostics results. In the process of problems and potential opportunities diagnostics, which appear while forming and realization competitive marketing strategies of consumer cooperatives trade enterprises, presence of marketing informational system is particularly important. It {{is part and parcel of}} information providing system of every enterprise subjects. Undoubtedly, application of marketing informational system favors to gaining while marketing researches, inner and outer information transformation into necessary resources for taking correspondent managerial decisions. But episodic marketing researches are unable to produce quality information about objective situation of further enterprise functioning. Process of enterprises and organizations development problems must have systematic character. We should note that creation and support of constantly working informational system is complicated in consumer cooperatives trade enterprises activity. In our case it is necessary to send separate functions, parts, stages of marketing researches to side-organizations, specializing upon providing necessary information to the subjects. Diagnostics of marketing problems (opportunities) of enterprises is a process at which further work is based all. Inner diagnostics includes the following research directions: analysis of product portfolio, assortment policy, expenses and profit norms due to current assortment of trade enterprise; analysis and diagnostics of main parameters of enterprise commercial activity; estimation of enterprise promotional activity; effectiveness estimation of main business process of trade enterprise; diagnostics of effectivity of managerial activity; diagnostics of staff and organizational structure of enterprise; estimation of correspondence of profit norms and market trade off availability due to each group of goods; marketing activities effectiveness analysis; analysis of general effectiveness of enterprise functioning and so on. Outer diagnostics is conducted according to such factors of macro and micro environment: macroenvironment condition, market condition, competitors, public opinion and consumer behavior, etc. Conclusions and directions of further researches. In conclusion we can state that analysis of inner and outer diagnostics criteria gives information about marketing potential and possibilities of reorientation of trade enterprises into market sufficient functioning concept due to which forming and management background of their competitive marketing strategies appear...|$|R
40|$|Principal Topic A small firm is {{unlikely}} to possess internally {{the full range of}} knowledge and skills that it requires or could benefit from for the development of its business. The ability to acquire suitable external expertise - defined as knowledge or competence that is rare in the firm and acquired from the outside - when needed thus becomes a competitive factor in itself. Access to external expertise enables the firm to focus on its core competencies and removes the necessity to internalize every skill and competence. However, research on how small firms access external expertise is still scarce. The present study contributes to this under-developed discussion by analysing the role of trust and strong ties in the small firm's selection and evaluation of sources of external expertise (henceforth referred to as the 'business advisor' or 'advisor'). Granovetter (1973, 1361) defines the strength of a network tie as 'a (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding) and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie'. Strong ties {{in the context of the}} present investigation refer to sources of external expertise who are well known to the owner-manager, and who may be either informal (e. g., family, friends) or professional advisors (e. g., <b>consultants,</b> <b>enterprise</b> support officers, accountants or solicitors). Previous research has suggested that strong and weak ties have different fortes and the choice of business advisors could thus be critical to business performance) While previous research results suggest that small businesses favour previously well known business advisors, prior studies have also pointed out that an excessive reliance on a network of well known actors might hamper business development, as the range of expertise available through strong ties is limited. But are owner-managers of small businesses aware of this limitation and does it matter to them? Or does working with a well-known advisor compensate for it? Hence, our research model first examines the impact of the strength of tie on the business advisor's perceived performance. Next, we ask what encourages a small business owner-manager to seek advice from a strong tie. A recent exploratory study by Welter and Kautonen (2005) drew attention to the central role of trust in this context. However, while their study found support for the general proposition that trust plays an important role in the choice of advisors, how trust and its different dimensions actually affect this choice remained ambiguous. The present paper develops this discussion by considering the impact of the different dimensions of perceived trustworthiness, defined as benevolence, integrity and ability, on the strength of tie. Further, we suggest that the dimensions of perceived trustworthiness relevant in the choice of a strong tie vary between professional and informal advisors. Methodology/Key Propositions Our propositions are examined empirically based on survey data comprising 153 Finnish small businesses. The data are analysed utilizing the partial least squares (PLS) approach to structural equation modelling with SmartPLS 2. 0. Being non-parametric, the PLS algorithm is particularly well-suited to analysing small datasets with non-normally distributed variables. Results and Implications The path model shows that the stronger the tie, the more positively the advisor's performance is perceived. Hypothesis 1, that strong ties will be associated with higher perceptions of performance is clearly supported. Benevolence is clearly the most significant predictor of the choice of a strong tie for external expertise. While ability also reaches a moderate level of statistical significance, integrity does not have a statistically significant impact on the choice of a strong tie. Hence, we found support for two out of three independent variables included in Hypothesis 2. Path coefficients differed between the professional and informal advisor subsamples. The results of the exploratory group comparison show that Hypothesis 3 a regarding ability being associated with strong ties more pronouncedly when choosing a professional advisor was not supported. Hypothesis 3 b arguing that benevolence is more strongly associated with strong ties in the context of choosing an informal advisor received some support because the path coefficient in the informal advisor subsample was much larger than in the professional advisor subsample. Hypothesis 3 c postulating that integrity would be more strongly associated with strong ties in the choice of a professional advisor was supported. Integrity is the most important dimension of trustworthiness in this context. However, integrity is of no concern, or even negative, when using strong ties to choose an informal advisor. The findings of this study have practical relevance to the enterprise support community. First of all, given that the strength of tie has a significant positive impact on the advisor's perceived performance, this implies that small business owners appreciate working with advisors in long-term relationships. Therefore, advisors are well advised to invest into relationship building and maintenance in their work with small firms. Secondly, the results show that, especially in the context of professional advisors, the advisor's perceived integrity and benevolence weigh more than ability. This again emphasizes the need to invest time and effort into building a personal relationship with the owner-manager, rather than merely maintaining a professional image and credentials. Finally, this study demonstrates that the dimensions of perceived trustworthiness are orthogonal with different effects on the strength of tie and ultimately perceived performance. This means that entrepreneurs and advisors should consider the specific dimensions of ability, benevolence and integrity, rather than rely on general perceptions of trustworthiness in their advice relationships...|$|R
