Daily precipitation measurements and monthly measurements of soil water storage {{to a depth of}} 0. 7 m were used to calculate crop water use (ET) and its components.

Investigations of water-rock interactions at Ogeu indicate that these mineral waters from sedimentary environments result from the mixing of deep waters with evaporitic signature with surficial karstic waters. A 3 -year hydrochemical monitoring of Ogeu springwater evidences that using arbitrary thresholds constituted by the mean ± 1 or 2 ?, as often performed in such studies, is not a suitable approach to characterize transient anomalies. Instead, {{we have used a}} mixing function F calculated with chemical elements, which display a conservative behavior not controlled by the precipitation of a mineral phase. F is processed with seismic energy release (E s) and <b>effective</b> <b>rainfalls</b> (R). Linear impulse responses of F to E s and R have been calculated. Rapid responses (10 days) to rainwater inputs are evidenced, consisting in the recharge of the shallow karstic reservoir by fresh water. Complex impulse response of F to microseismic activity is also evidenced. It consists in a 2 -phase hydrologic signal, with an inflow of saline water in the shallow reservoir with a response delay of 10 days, followed by an inflow of karstic water with a response delay of 70 days, the amount being higher than the saline inflow. Such a process probably results from changes in volumetric strain with subsequent microfracturation transient episodes allowing short inflow of deep salted water in the aquifer. This study demonstrates that groundwater systems in such environments are unstable systems that are highly sensitive to both rainfall inputs and microseismic activity. Impulse responses calculation of F to E s is shown to be a powerful tool to identify transient anomalies. Similar processing is suggested to be potentially efficient to detect precursors of earthquakes when long time-series (5 years at least) are available in areas with high seismicity...|$|R

However, the ability of long fallowing for soil water conservation has been questioned in some dryland regions including Central Aragon. This research was aimed to quantify soil water losses (E), soil water storage (SWS) and precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) of long fallow under three management systems (conventional tillage, CT; reduced tillage, RT; no-tillage, NT). The PSE of long fallow relative to short fallow (5 - 6 months) was also evaluated. Over four experimental years (1999 - 2002), soil water balance for both short and long fallow periods was calculated from fallow seasonal precipitation and volumetric soil water content (0 - 70 cm depth). During long fallowing, primary tillage implemented in CT and RT plots induced significant E losses from the plough layer for the first 24 h after tillage. However, secondary tillage under CT and RT appeared to have a positive effect on soil water conservation at the end of fallow. Despite a different soil water dynamics among treatments, total E at the end of fallow was similar for the three fallow management systems. The partitioning of long fallow into three sub-periods showed that the early phase (July-November) was the most efficient in terms of SWS, having the lowest average daily evaporation rate (Er) per day (0. 65 mm day- 1). The overwinter period (December-May) and the late period (June- November) had greater Er values (0. 93 and 1. 09 mm day- 1, respectively) and variable SWS as a function of rainfall pattern in those periods. In general, PSE, either for the fallow phases or the entire fallow period, increased when most of seasonal <b>effective</b> <b>rainfalls</b> ( 10 mm day- 1) were received in the last two months of each period.
