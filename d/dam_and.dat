40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} develop a method based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict permanent earthquake-induced deformation of the earth <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> embankments. For this purpose, data sets of observations from 152 published case histories {{on the performance of}} the earth <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> embankments, during the past earthquakes, was used. In order to predict earthquake-induced deformation of the earth <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> embankments a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) analysis was used. A four-layer, feed-forward, back-propagation neural network, with a topology of 7 - 9 - 7 - 1 was found to be optimum. The results showed that an appropriately trained neural network could reliably predict permanent earthquake-induced deformation of the earth <b>dams</b> <b>and</b> embankments...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris <b>Dam</b> <b>and</b> Watts Bar <b>Dam,</b> <b>and</b> the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10.
