I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

[...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced.

Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation.
