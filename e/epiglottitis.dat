5|$|Croup is {{typically}} diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The {{first step is}} to exclude other obstructive conditions of the upper airway, especially <b>epiglottitis,</b> an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|Croup can {{be caused}} by a number of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as <b>epiglottitis</b> or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or <b>epiglottitis.</b> Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the {{epiglottis}} {{is known}} as <b>epiglottitis.</b> <b>Epiglottitis</b> is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with <b>epiglottitis</b> may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute <b>epiglottitis</b> is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. <b>Epiglottitis</b> is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E

25|$|Most {{cases are}} caused by a viral infection. Strep throat is the cause in about 25% of {{children}} and 10% of adults. Uncommon causes include other bacteria such as gonorrhea, fungus, irritants such as smoke, allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection such as a cold. Otherwise a rapid antigen detection test (RAPD) or throat swab is recommended. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include <b>epiglottitis,</b> thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, and occasionally heart disease.|$|E

In the days {{immediately}} following his death, Craik and Dick's published account stated that they felt that his symptoms had been consistent with cynanche trachealis, a term of that period used to describe severe inflammation of the structures of the upper airway. Even at that early date, there were accusations of medical malpractice, with some believing that Washington had been bled to death. Various modern medical authors have speculated that Washington probably died from a severe case of <b>epiglottitis</b> which was complicated by the given treatments (all of which were accepted medical practice in Washington's day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused hypovolemic shock.|$|E

The condition is life-threatening and needs immediate hospitalization. <b>Epiglottitis</b> is treated with antibiotics.
