40|$|A {{program of}} {{research}} on the explosibility of coal dust/methane mixtures is described. An explosion test chamber uses a rotating drum concept for dust dispersion and infra-red sensors for dust concentration measurement. A new approach to the determination of coal dust concentration is included with a description of a dielectric dust probe. The measurement technique is based on the change in dielectric constant as the proportion of coal dust in air between probe capacitor plates increases or decreases. The particle size distribution, coal proximate analysis and elemental analysis were studied. Explosibility test results indicate that a very low concentration of coal dust can form an <b>explosible</b> <b>mixture</b> when dispersed in methane concentration of just below five percent. With low temperature initiators, the coal dust lean limit concentration rises rapidly as the methane concentration is reduced...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} paper [1], {{the possibility of}} igniting a combustible dust-air mixtures by a light beam in contact with a substrate made of an inert matter and heated by a light beam was investigated. The objective of the present work is to produce more data on the subject. The available results suggest a strong similarity between combustible dust-air <b>mixtures</b> and <b>explosible</b> gas-air <b>mixtures</b> {{within the scope of}} the investigated ignition phenomena. In particular a relationship between the standard ignition temperature of dust clouds and the temperature of the target at the minimum incident power at ignition (continuous irradiation) has been highlighted which seems to be similar to the one obtained for gases. If confirmed, this would imply that the knowledge of these standard parameters would help in predicting the danger of igniting any kind of <b>explosible</b> <b>mixtures</b> including hybrid mixtures (combustible gas-combustible dust-air) or oxygen depleted/enriched mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Looking at the German and Dutch statistics, the {{percentage}} of dust explosions in all industries dealing with <b>explosible</b> dust-air <b>mixtures</b> which have been ignited by electrostatic discharges is about 8 - 10 %. However, in the plastics industry this value is much higher: 25 %. In particular {{in the last few}} years some rather large industrial incidents probably have been caused by electrostatic charges. To understand why accidents may happen due to static electricity the several dangerous electrostatic discharges will be discussed briefly in connection with dust explosion hazards. In particular the propagating brush discharge and the cone or " Maurer " discharge are important. Ignitions are caused mainly in the case of easily ignitable powders or hybrid mixtures (powders in combination with flammable vapours) due to isolated conductors and non-conducting materials as the product itself or such process parts as flexible hoses, internally coated silos and ducts. To illustrate how hazards by electrostatic discharges may develop in real life both on a small and a large scale a few examples will be briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{underground}} mines, {{coal dust}} explosions are prevented {{by the addition}} of rock dust sufficient to render the coal dust inert. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed a hand-held instrument that uses optical reflectance to measure the explosibility of a rock dust and coal dust mixture. This instrument is called the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM). In this study, NIOSH personnel accompanied Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) inspectors on their routine band surveys in five and three underground coal mines in MSHA District 2 (PA) and District 11 (AL), respectively. While underground, NIOSH personnel and MSHA inspectors used the CDEM to assess the explosibilities of the dust samples. The values of percent incombustible content (% IC) determined by the CDEM agreed well with those obtained later by low temperature ashing (LTA) in both MSHA and NIOSH laboratories. Further, the meter identified some samples as potentially explosible that LTA analysis had found to possess sufficient rock dust for inerting. The CDEM provides more information on the hazards in the mine. Rapid identification of areas with <b>explosible</b> dust <b>mixtures</b> using the CDEM allows for immediate intervention rather than a wait of several weeks for laboratory analysis...|$|R
40|$|From {{time to time}} {{installations}} for {{gas production}} (form fossil fuels) and distribution and plants of the crude {{oil and natural gas}} processing industry are struck by fire or explosions where the cause is seen in pyrogens such as iron sulphides and oxides and iron. These are thought to act as ignition sources in the <b>explosible</b> gas-air <b>mixtures.</b> The studies performed revealed a relationship between pyrophoricity (controlled by means of partial inactivation of pyrogens through heating in a flow of N_ 2 /O_ 2 in certain temperature and time conditions) and the chemical and aggregate composition as well as secondary structure (porosity, specific surface) of the pyrogen. They permit conclusions for industrial practice and safety. The laboratory studies were mainly performed on pyrophorous and partially inactivated pyrophorous iron and iron sulphide powders. The sensitivity of the sample material to air required developing special preparation and measuring techniques. This did not succeed in every case. The employed procedures included REM with EOX, porosimetry, thermoanalysis and computerrided radiographic phase analysis. (orig.) In Anlagen der Gaserzeugung (aus fossilen Brennstoffen) und -fortleitung sowie der erdoel- und erdgasverarbeitenden Industrie kommt es immer wieder zu Braenden und Explosionen, bei denen pyrophore Stoffe, wie Eisensulfide, -oxide und Eisen, als Zuendquellen fuer explosive Gas-Luft-Gemische verantwortlich gemacht werden. Ergebnis der Untersuchungen sind Zusammenhaenge zwischen Pyrophoritaetgrad (eingestellt ueber Teilinaktivierung pyrophorer Stoffe durch Erhitzen im N_ 2 /O_ 2 -Gasstrom unter bestimmten Temperatur/Zeit-Bedingungen) und Sekundaerstruktur (Porositaet, spezifische Oberflaeche), chemischer sowie Phasenzusammensetzung und Schlussfolgerungen fuer die Praxis und Betriebssicherheit. Die Laboruntersuchungen wurden hauptsaechlich an pyrophoren und teilinaktivierten pyrophoren Eisen- und Eisensulfid-Pulvern durchgefuehrt. Wegen der Luftempfindlichkeit des Probenmaterials war die Erarbeitung spezieller Praeparations- und Messtechniken erforderlich. Das gelang nicht in jedem Fall. Eingesetzte Methoden waren u. a. REM mit EDX, Porosimetrie, Thermoanalyse, computergestuetzte roentgenographische Phasenanalyse. (orig.)
