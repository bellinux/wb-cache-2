40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings,</b> crank disk and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings.</b> Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

5000|$|Automatic lockers {{lock and}} unlock {{automatically}} with no direct {{input from the}} driver. Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will [...] "unlock" [...] only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed [...] "automatic unlocking" [...] differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the famous [...] "Detroit Locker," [...] made by Eaton Corporation, {{also known as the}} [...] "Detroit No-Spin," [...] which replaces the entire <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly.

40|$|The free {{electrons}} in the earth's ionosphere can retard {{the time of}} reception of GPS signals received at a ground station, compared to their time in free space, by many tens of nanoseconds, thus limiting the accuracy of time transfer by GPS. The amount of the ionospheric time delay {{is proportional to the}} total number of electrons encountered by the wave on its path from each GPS satellite to a receiver. This integrated number of electrons is called Total Electron Content, or TEC. Dual frequency GPS receivers designed by Allen Osborne Associates, Inc. (AOA) directly measure both the ionospheric differential group delay and the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase advance for the two GPS frequencies and derive from this the TEC between the receiver and each GPS satellite in track. The group delay information is mainly used to provide an absolute calibration to the relative <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase, which is an extremely precise measure of relative TEC. The AOA Mini-Rogue ICS- 4 Z and the AOA TurboRogue ICS- 4000 Z receivers normally operate using the GPS P code, when available, and switch to cross-correlation signal processing when the GPS satellites are in the Anti-Spoofing (A-S) mode and the P code is encrypted. An AOA ICS-Z receiver has been operated continuously for over a year at Hanscom AFB, MA to determine the statistics of the variability of the TEC parameter using signals from up to four different directions simultaneously. The 4 -channel ICS- 4 Z and the 8 -channel ICS- 4000 Z, have proven capabilities to make precise, well calibrated, measurements of the ionosphere in several directions simultaneously. In addition to providing ionospheric corrections for precise time transfer via satellite, this dual frequency design allows full code and automatic codeless operation of both the differential group delay and <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase for numerous ionospheric experiments being conducted. Statistical results of the data collected from the ICS- 4 Z during the initial year of ionospheric time delay in the northeastern U.

40|$|Advances in {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAV) {{and especially}} micro aerial vehicle (MAV) technology together with increasing quality and decreasing price of imaging devices {{have resulted in}} growing use of MAVs in photogrammetry. The practicality of MAV mapping is seriously enhanced {{with the ability to}} determine parameters of exterior orientation (EO) with sufficient accuracy, in both absolute and relative senses (change of attitude between successive images). While <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase GNSS satisfies cm-level positioning accuracy, precise attitude determination is essential for both direct sensor orientation (DiSO) and integrated sensor orientation (ISO) in corridor mapping or in block configuration imaging over surfaces with low texture. Limited cost, size, and weight of MAVs represent limitations on quality of onboard navigation sensors and puts emphasis on exploiting full capacity of available resources. Typically short flying times (10 - 30 minutes) also limit the possibility of estimating and/or correcting factors such as sensor misalignment and poor attitude initialization of inertial navigation system (INS). This research aims at increasing the accuracy of attitude determination in both absolute and relative senses with no extra sensors onboard. In comparison to classical INS/GNSS setup, novel approach is presented here to integrated state estimation, in which vehicle dynamic model (VDM) is used as the main process model. Such system benefits from available information from autopilot and physical properties of the platform in enhancing performance of determination of trajectory and parameters of exterior orientation consequently. The navigation system employs a <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase GNSS receiver and a micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) grade inertial measurement unit (IMU), together with MAV control input from autopilot. Monte-Carlo simulation has been performed on trajectories for typical corridor mapping and block imaging. Results reveal considerable reduction in attitude errors with respect to conventional INS/GNSS system, in both absolute and relative senses.
