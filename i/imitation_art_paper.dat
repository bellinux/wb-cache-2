Since these five definitions share in common one quality (sameness), which is the imitation, he finally qualifies sophistry as <b>imitation</b> <b>art.</b> Following the division of the <b>imitation</b> <b>art</b> in copy-making and appearance-making, he discovers that sophistry falls under the appearance-making art, namely the Sophist imitates the wise man.|$|R

40|$|The {{waste of}} mendong craft {{industry}} consist {{of natural and}} colored mendong that contains of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and wax. These substances can be use to make <b>art</b> <b>paper.</b> Craft products that produce from <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> or the <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> itself have a good prospect for export. In this research, the preparation of pulp and <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> from this waste using NaOH soaking variation of 10 % and 20 % at 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours with 1 % weight of tapioca as strengthener. The resulting pulp were tested of its alpha cellulose, hemi cellulose and extractive contain. The <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> were tested of its grammage, tearing strength, tensile strength, bursting strength, folding recovery, porosity, roughness and water absorbance Cobb 60 test. As a result, the thinnest <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> is produced from pulping process of 20 % NaOH soaking at 3 hours and 15 minutes blending, while the thickest <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> is produced from pulping process of 10 % NaOH soaking for 3 hours and 30 minutes blending...|$|R

These papers share many characteristics with traditional watercolor, printmaking, and photographic <b>papers.</b> Fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> are designed to meet similar standards for longevity as traditional fine art papers: they should have a neutral pH, be lignin-free, and not include optical brighteners. Fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> differ from traditional fine <b>art</b> <b>papers,</b> in that they include coatings engineered to receive and hold ink. Fine <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> are usually made of rag pulp (100% cotton being the most common) but may also be have an alpha-cellulose base. Some descriptions and comparisons of fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> are here, here, here, and here.

40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of offset <b>paper</b> and <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> including smoothness, gloss and absorbability, dot percentage and the tri-stimulus values of every dot areas and solid {{areas of the}} printed paper samples were measured. Dot gain curve and chromatic diagram were drawn after dot gain values and chromatic coordinates (x, y) were calculated. The results showed that smaller dot gain value and greater color gamut occur on the <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> due to its higher smoothness, gloss and lower absorbability when the printing conditions were the same, so the printing dot reproduction quality {{on the surface of}} <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> is better. However because offset paper has lower smoothness and gloss, higher absorbability compared with <b>art</b> <b>paper,</b> therefore the dot reproduction quality on offset paper is not as good as <b>art</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|R

40|$|There have {{in recent}} years been {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} print achieved using large format inkjet printers with stable pigmented ink sets on fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> coated with an ink receptive layer. Increasingly professional photographers, graphic artists, printmakers and artists from all disciplines are using inkjet technology to produce prints. Existing uncoated fine <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> can also offer a rich variety of substrates for inkjet printing. An identified problem is the colour variation between prints produced on coated and uncoated papers. This however can be remedied through correct linearisation and profiling. Colour management using ICC profiles is a very useful method {{to improve the quality of}} digital inkjet printing. The Centre for Fine Print Research, UWE and John Purcell Paper have undertaken research into digital printing on coated and fine <b>art</b> <b>papers.</b> The aim of the research was to develop a series of standard and bespoke ICC profile for a range of specialist coated and uncoated fine <b>art</b> <b>papers,</b> inks and printers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic <b>papers</b> (fine <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> gloss, fine <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> mat, offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset <b>paper,</b> fine <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> mat and fine <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> gloss. Such results are completely in accordance with the original roughness of paper. Key words: offset, offset cylinder, deviation of the printe...|$|R
