5|$|Dopamine {{itself is}} used as {{precursor}} in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and <b>epinephrine.</b> Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, with O2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine is converted into <b>epinephrine</b> by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the cofactor.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{to severe}} croup may be {{improved}} temporarily with nebulized <b>epinephrine.</b> While <b>epinephrine</b> typically produces {{a reduction in}} croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Tyrosine (and its {{precursor}} phenylalanine) are precursors of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, <b>epinephrine</b> and norepinephrine {{and various}} trace amines.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cofactors {{also require}} their own synthesis. Deficiency in any {{required}} amino acid or cofactor can impair {{the synthesis of}} dopamine, norepinephrine, and <b>epinephrine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, <b>epinephrine,</b> or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, <b>epinephrine</b> and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of the limbs detected by proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (<b>epinephrine)</b> from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled <b>epinephrine</b> may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (<b>epinephrine)</b> are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to <b>epinephrine</b> by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect the heart rate. High levels of the hormones <b>epinephrine,</b> norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase the heart rate. The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or <b>epinephrine</b> in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal tubes {{can be used}} {{to ensure}} the {{adequate}} exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as helium, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, xenon, or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine, <b>epinephrine,</b> lidocaine and vasopressin.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and <b>epinephrine</b> (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and <b>epinephrine</b> is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, <b>epinephrine,</b> histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} membrane, which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of <b>epinephrine,</b> and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as <b>epinephrine,</b> norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine</b> (adrenaline) {{reacts with}} both α- and β-adrenoreceptors, causing {{vasoconstriction}} and vasodilation, respectively. Although α receptors are less sensitive to <b>epinephrine,</b> when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by β-adrenoreceptors {{because there are}} more peripheral α1 receptors than β-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating <b>epinephrine</b> cause vasoconstriction. At lower levels of circulating <b>epinephrine</b> (physiologic <b>epinephrine</b> secretion), β-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since <b>epinephrine</b> has a higher affinity for the β2 adrenoreceptor than the α1 adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Among American health {{professionals}} and scientists, the term <b>epinephrine</b> is used over adrenaline. However, pharmaceuticals that mimic {{the effects of}} <b>epinephrine</b> are often called adrenergics, and receptors for <b>epinephrine</b> are called adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors.|$|E
25|$|During {{exercise}} the <b>epinephrine</b> blood concentration rises partially from increased secretion from the adrenal medulla and partly from decreased metabolism because of reduced hepatic blood flow. Infusion of <b>epinephrine</b> to reproduce exercise circulating concentrations of <b>epinephrine</b> in subjects at rest has little haemodynamic effect, {{other than a}} small β2-mediated fall in diastolic blood pressure. Infusion of <b>epinephrine</b> well within the physiological range suppresses human airway hyper-reactivity sufficiently to antagonize the constrictor effects of inhaled histamine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine</b> is {{the drug}} of choice for {{treating}} anaphylaxis. Different strengths, doses and routes of administration of <b>epinephrine</b> are used.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is a minor}} {{contributor}} to total circulating catecholamines (L-DOPA is at a higher concentration in the plasma), though it contributes over 90% of circulating <b>epinephrine.</b> Little <b>epinephrine</b> is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered chromaffin cells. Following adrenalectomy, <b>epinephrine</b> disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.|$|E
25|$|A common {{concentration}} for <b>epinephrine</b> is a 2.25% <b>epinephrine</b> solution, {{which contains}} 2.25g/100mL or 2.25mg/mL. While a 1% solution is typically used for aerosolization.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving <b>epinephrine</b> depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. <b>Epinephrine</b> does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that sotalol, a β adrenoceptor antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered <b>epinephrine</b> on memory. These findings suggest that β adrenoceptors are necessary for <b>epinephrine</b> {{to have an effect}} on memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|Every {{emotional}} response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes {{the release of}} <b>epinephrine,</b> an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to <b>epinephrine</b> is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with <b>epinephrine</b> expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of <b>epinephrine.</b> Overall, the greater amount of <b>epinephrine</b> is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that <b>epinephrine</b> elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which {{can be attributed to the}} feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between <b>epinephrine</b> and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce <b>epinephrine.</b> Findings support the idea that <b>epinephrine</b> does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{intrinsic}} efficacy (receptor binding ability) of <b>epinephrine,</b> high concentrations of the drug cause negative side effects when treating asthma. The value of using nebulized <b>epinephrine</b> in acute asthma is unclear.|$|E
25|$|One {{physiological}} {{stimulus to}} <b>epinephrine</b> secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated using the denervated pupil {{of a cat}} as an assay, later confirmed using a biological assay on urine samples. Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards. Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of <b>epinephrine</b> in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme-isotope derivate radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for <b>epinephrine.</b> Early REA plasma assays indicated that <b>epinephrine</b> and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when anaerobic metabolism commences.|$|E
25|$|Several {{medications}} {{may be used}} {{to block}} the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, <b>epinephrine</b> (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases. Anti-cholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil chemotaxis, are also commonly used. Though rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires <b>epinephrine</b> injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an <b>epinephrine</b> autoinjector may be used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine,</b> {{also known}} as {{adrenalin}} or adrenaline, is a hormone, neurotransmitter, and medication. <b>Epinephrine</b> is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and certain neurons. It {{plays an important role}} in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors. It is found in many animals and some single cell organisms. Napoleon Cybulski first isolated <b>epinephrine</b> in 1895.|$|E
25|$|Anaphylactic shock {{is treated}} with <b>epinephrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine</b> may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma or serum as a diagnostic aid, to monitor therapeutic administration, or {{to identify the}} causative agent in a potential poisoning victim. Endogenous plasma <b>epinephrine</b> concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. Pheochromocytoma patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000–10,000ng/L. Parenteral administration of <b>epinephrine</b> to acute-care cardiac patients can produce plasma concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000ng/L.|$|E
25|$|As a hormone, <b>epinephrine</b> acts {{on nearly}} all body tissues. Its actions vary by tissue type and tissue {{expression}} of adrenergic receptors. For example, {{high levels of}} <b>epinephrine</b> causes smooth muscle relaxation in the airways but causes contraction of the smooth muscle that lines most arterioles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine</b> is {{available}} in an autoinjector delivery system.|$|E
25|$|Low, or absent, {{concentrations}} of <b>epinephrine</b> {{can be seen}} in autonomic neuropathy or following adrenalectomy. Failure of the adrenal cortex, as with Addisons disease, can suppress <b>epinephrine</b> secretion as the activity of the synthesing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, depends on the high concentration of cortisol that drains from the cortex to the medulla.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epinephrine</b> is {{normally}} produced {{by both the}} adrenal glands and certain neurons. It {{plays an important role}} in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. <b>Epinephrine</b> does this by its effects on alpha and beta receptors. It is found in many animals and some one cell organisms.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include <b>epinephrine,</b> clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of <b>epinephrine,</b> the most widely used additive. <b>Epinephrine</b> increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as <b>epinephrine.</b> Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
