5|$|In {{the early}} years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the {{government}} was tightly managed by the shrewd Cecil, later Earl of Salisbury, ably assisted by the experienced Thomas Egerton, whom James made Baron Ellesmere and Lord Chancellor, and by Thomas Sackville, soon Earl of Dorset, who continued as Lord Treasurer. As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on bigger issues, such as a scheme <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly hunting.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the small}} vessels managed to return to England: MLs 160, 307 and 443. They had reached the {{rendezvous}} and waited until 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been attacked once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try and avoid the German Air Force, but a Junkers 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. The ships opened fire and hit the Junkers in the cockpit. The plane went into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm & Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships, but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The surviving MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.|$|E

5|$|In 1467, {{as part of}} his brother's plan <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> {{relationship}} with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale's rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick's daughter Isabelle whilst anchored off Calais; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

25|$|Even though central {{politicians}} and officials {{had been converted}} and convinced of the necessity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> Swedish–Finnish cooperation, parliamentarians and prominent individuals did not change their anti-Swedish or anti-Finnish attitudes as easily.

These impressions, in turn, were compounded by a tendency in Sweden to emphasize the danger of Nazi expansionism and to view the Soviet Union {{with a great deal}} of goodwill: in Finland, however, the converse view was dominant.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 1991, Heinz and {{six other}} people, {{including}} two children, were killed when a Sun Co.

While moving in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look, the helicopter collided with the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to poor judgment by the pilots of the two aircraft involved.|$|E

25|$|Christofle Charvet {{created the}} first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were {{generally}} made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected and shirts made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men's fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> fitting shirt led to curving the armhole and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise à pièce (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much {{in the manner of}} contemporary collars, and the concept of the detachable collar.|$|E
25|$|The Bf 109A was {{the first}} version of the Bf 109. Armament was {{initially}} planned to be just two cowl-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns. However, possibly due to the introduction of the Hurricane and Spitfire, each with eight 7.7mm (.303in) machine guns, experiments were carried out with a third machine gun firing through the propeller shaft. V4 and some A-0 were powered by a 640PS (631hp, 471kW) Junkers Jumo 210B engine driving a two-blade fixed-pitch propeller, but production was changed to the 670PS (661hp, 493kW) Jumo 210D as soon as it became available. The A-0 was not of a uniform type; there were several changes in their appearance. Visible changes included engine, cockpit and machine gun ventilation holes/slats, and the location of the oil cooler was changed several times to prevent overheating. Many of these Bf 109 A-0 served with the Legion Condor and were often misidentified as B-series aircraft, and probably served in Spain with the tactical markings 6-1 to 6–16. One A-0, marked as 6–15, ran out of fuel and was forced to land behind enemy lines. It was captured by Republican troops on 11 November 1937 and later transferred to the Soviet Union <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> inspection. 6–15 incorporated several improvements from the Bf 109B production program and had been prepared to use a variable-pitch propeller although it had not been installed.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

A version of the creatures as large as Voyager arrives, and the crew realize {{that they have been}} mistaken for another of the species; the smaller creatures are attempting to mate with the ship.

500|$|The {{placement}} of carrel spaces at the periphery {{was the product}} of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks {{on the periphery of the}} library and reading rooms toward the center. [...] Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look: [...] "A man with a book goes to the light. [...] A library begins that way. [...] He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light." [...] Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. [...] The book stacks also look out into the atrium.|$|E

500|$|After {{the last}} Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania had {{become part of}} the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, the Poles and the Lithuanians {{attempted}} to restore their independence. They rebelled during the November Uprising in 1830 and the January Uprising in 1863, but the first realistic opportunity came about during World War I. In 1915, Germany occupied Lithuania as its troops marched towards Russia. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, opportunities for independence opened up. Germany, avoiding direct annexation, tried to find a middle path that would involve some kind of union with Germany. In the light of upcoming peace negotiations with Russia, the Germans agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to be detached from Russia and wished <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> relationship with Germany. However, the conference, held between 18 and 23 September 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would depend on whether it recognized the new state. On 21 September, the attendees at the conference elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania to establish this resolution. The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published, but they did permit the council to proceed. The authorities censored the council's newspaper, Lietuvos aidas (Echo of Lithuania), preventing the council from reaching a wider public audience. The conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected [...] "in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania".|$|E
500|$|The second, more {{fundamental}} rift, concerned {{a discussion about}} whether NATO should form close relationships with countries far beyond NATO's borders, in particular Australia, Japan and South Korea. The United States and some other NATO members pressed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> relationship with these countries. R. Nicholas Burns, Under Secretary for Political Affairs explained the US proposal: [...] "We seek a partnership with them {{so that we can}} train more intensively (...) and grow closer to them because we are deployed with them. Australia, South Korea and Japan are in Afghanistan. They have all been in Iraq (...) [...] in the Balkans." [...] It was however not clear how far this plan would have gone in practice, but the US insisted they were not seeking to turn NATO into a global alliance: membership would not be offered to the prospective new partners. The idea of a [...] "global" [...] NATO however was strongly opposed by France, which considers NATO a regional defence alliance that should not spread its wings too far over the globe. The French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie summarized the position of France as follows: [...] "The development of a global partnership could... dilute the natural solidarity between Europeans and North Americans in a fuzzy entity [...] send a bad political message, that of a campaign launched by the West against those who don't share their ideas. What a pretext we would offer to those who promote the idea of a clash of civilisations." [...] The summit did not reach a satisfying consensus on the future role of NATO and it was considered an exercise in [...] "papering over cracks", much more than it was ever a serious effort to decide on the future borders and core purposes. As a consequence the debate continued after the summit.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to {{prospective}} buyers. Meanwhile, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out. Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because [...] "hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity." ...|$|E
