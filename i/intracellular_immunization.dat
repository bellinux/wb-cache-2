40|$|<b>Intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> {{to target}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) regulatory protein Rev has been explored as a genetic therapy for AIDS. Efficient intracellular expression of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions of anti-Rev monoclonal antibodies, with various vectors, and subsequent inhibition of HIV- 1 replication have been previously reported by our laboratories. To further understand the molecular mechanisms and effects that intracellular anti-Rev single chain variable fragments (SFvs) have against HIV- 1, via blocking of Rev function, two anti-Rev SFvs which specifically bind to differing epitopes of the Rev protein have been cloned. One SFv binds to the Rev activation domain, and the second SFv binds to the distal C terminus of Rev in the nonactivation region. Further studies now demonstrate that both anti-Rev SFvs lead to variable resistance to HIV- 1 infection. Although binding affinity assays demonstrated that the SFv which specifically recognizes the Rev activation domain (D 8) had an extracellular binding affinity significantly {{lower than that of}} the SFv specific to the nonactivation region (D 1 O), the SFv D 8 demonstrated more potent activity in inhibiting virus production in human T-cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells than did SFv D 10. Thus, extracellular binding affinities of an SFv for a target viral protein cannot be used to directly predict its activity as an <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> moiety. These data demonstrate potential approaches for <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> against HIV- 1 infection, by efficiently blocking specific motifs of Rev to after the function of this retroviral regulatory protein. These studies extend the understanding of the effects, on a molecular level, of SFvs binding to critical epitopes of Rev and further suggest that rational design of SFvs, with interactions involving specific viral moieties which mediate HIV- 1 expression, may hold promise for the clinical application of genetic therapies to combat AIDS...|$|E
40|$|Preventing the protein-protein {{interaction}} of the cellular chromatin binding protein Lens Epithelium- Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase is an important possible strategy for anti-viral treatment for AIDS. We have used Intracellular Antibody Capture technology to isolate a single VH antibody domain that binds to LEDGF. The crystal structure of the LEDGF-VH complex reveals that the single domain antibody mimics the effect of binding of HIV integrase to LEDGF which is crucial for HIV propagation. CD 4 -expressing T cell lines were constructed to constitutively express the LEDGF-binding VH and these cells showed interference with HIV viral replication, assayed by virus capsid protein p 24 production. Therefore, pre-conditioning cells to express antibody fragments confers effective <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> for preventing chronic viral replication and can {{be a way to}} prevent HIV spread in infected patients.

40|$|As is true {{for other}} <b>intracellular</b> pathogens, <b>immunization</b> with live Chlamydia trachomatis {{generally}} induces stronger protective immunity than does immunization with inactivated organism. To investigate the basis for such a difference, we studied immune responses in BALB/c mice immunized with viable or UV-killed C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn). Strong, acquired resistance to C. trachomatis infection was elicited by immunization with viable but not dead organisms. Immunization with viable organisms induced high levels of antigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), gamma interferon production, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Immunization with inactivated MoPn mainly induced interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) production and IgG 1 antibody without IgA or DTH responses. Analysis of local early cytokine and cellular events at days 3, 5, and 7 after peritoneal cavity immunization showed that high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL- 12 were detected with viable but not inactivated organisms. Furthermore, enrichment of a dendritic cell (DC) -like population was detected in the peritoneal cavity only among mice immunized with viable organisms.

In the transduced cells infected with HIV- 1, the nascent Fab fragments bind intracellularly to the HIV- 1 envelope protein and inhibit HIV- 1 production. The secreted Fab fragments are able to neutralize cell-free HIV- 1. In addition, the nascent Fab fragments can inhibit HIV- 1 production by binding intracellularly to envelope mutants that escape neutralization by extracellular F 105 antibody. The combined intra- and extracellular binding activities of the expressed Fab fragments result in the efficient blocking of cytopathic syncytium formation and infectious virus production. Thus, these antibody-producing T lymphocytes are not only resistant to HIV- 1 infection but also can protect surrounding lymphocytes by secreting neutralizing antibodies.

40|$|Patients with Chagas’ disease remain {{asymptomatic}} {{for many}} years, presumably {{by keeping the}} etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi in check through protective immunity against. Recently, we found that T. cruzi uses TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase responsive to neurotrophin nerve growth factor in vertebrate nervous systems, to invade cells. We also found that TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, but not T. cruzi, are targets of specific autoantibodies present in the sera of patients with chronic Chagas’ disease. Here we show that TrkA-, TrkB-, and TrkC-specific autoantibodies isolated from the sera of four individuals with chronic indeterminate (asymptomatic) Chagas’ disease potently blocked invasion of Trk-bearing neuronal PC 12 cells, neuroglial astrocytes, enteroglial cells, and Schwann cells and Trk-expressing non-neural smooth muscle and dendritic cells. However, these autoantibodies did not inhibit T. cruzi invasion of mutant PC 12 cells lacking TrkA or of normal cells lacking Trk receptors, suggesting that autoantibodies interfered with parasite/Trk cross talk to access the <b>intracellular</b> milieu. Passive <b>immunization</b> of susceptible and resistant mouse strains with very small doses of these autoantibodies reduced parasitemia and transferred resistance to an otherwise lethal trypanosome infection.

Recent findings are suggesting the potential of the HBc VLPs as an oral immunogen. Here, we focus on the induction of serum humoral responses by oral administration of HBc VLPs in preparations substantially free of lipopolysaccharide and immunomodulating encapsidated RNA. The full-length HBc antigen was used, because the C-terminal arginine-rich tail may contribute to the immunogenicity of the antigen as the region is involved in cell surface heparan sulfate binding and internalization of the protein. Serum antibody levels and isotypes were determined following oral administration of the HBc VLPs with the perspective of using the HBc VLP as an immunostimulatory and carrier molecule for epitopes of blood-borne diseases in oral immunization vaccination strategies. Following oral administration of the HBc VLP preparations to mice, a strong serum humoral response was induced with mainly immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) antibodies, pointing toward a Th 1 response which is essential in the control of <b>intracellular</b> pathogens.

40|$|<b>Intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> is an anti-viral {{gene therapy}} {{strategy}} {{based on the}} introduction of DNA templates into cells to stably express genetic elements which inhibit viral gene expression and replication. We have recently developed an <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> strategy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that uses RNA decoys. RNA decoys are short RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the HIV trans activation response element (TAR) or Rev response element (RRE) sequences, which function by inhibiting the binding of the HIV regulatory proteins Tat and Rev to the authentic HIV RNA TAR and RRE regions, respectively. In this report we describe the characterization of potent RRE decoys containing the minimal 13 -nucleotide primary Rev binding domain of the RRE. Using an improved tRNA cassette to express high levels of RRE transcripts in CEM cells, we found that this new generation of minimal RRE decoys were more potent inhibitors of HIV in isolated cell lines than previously described TAR or RRE decoys. CEM cells expressing RRE decoys exhibited diminished Rev function in cotransfection assays, confirming the specificity of inhibition of HIV by RRE decoys and indicating that the 13 -nucleotide minimal Rev binding domain defined by using in vitro binding studies also binds Rev in vivo. Significant differences {{in the degree of}} HIV inhibition between individual CEM cell lines transduced with RRE decoy vectors which were not due to sequence alterations in the tRNA-RRE DNA template, differences in RRE decoy expression level, or endogenous variations in the resistance of CEM clonal cell lines to HIV were observed. In order to evaluate the efficacy of RRE decoys in a more realistic fashion than by comparison of individual clonal cell lines, polyclonal populations of transduced CEM cells were infected with HIV.

Here, we describe success in constructing a lentivirus-based vector to introduce siRNAs against the HIV- 1 coreceptor, CCR 5, into human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. With high-titer vector stocks, > 40 % of the peripheral blood T lymphocytes could be transduced, and {{the expression of a}} potent CCR 5 -siRNA resulted in up to 10 -fold inhibition of CCR 5 expression on the cell surface over a period of 2 weeks in the absence of selection.

Importantly, blocking CCR 5 expression by siRNAs provided a substantial protection for the lymphocyte populations from CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1 virus infection, dropping infected cells by 3 - to 7 -fold; only a minimal effect on infection by a CXCR 4 -tropic virus was observed.

This block in replication is not absolute, and HIV- 1 escape variants that were no longer inhibited by siRNA-Nef appeared after several weeks of culture. These RNAi-resistant viruses contained nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the Nef gene that modified or deleted the siRNA-Nef target sequence.

Mutagenesis of TAR {{was used to}} investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the observed inhibition. A nucleotide change which disrupts the stem structure of TAR or sequence alterations in the loop abolish {{the ability of the}} corresponding TAR decoy RNAs to inhibit HIV replication. A compensatory mutation which restores the stem structure also restores TAR decoy RNA function. Synthesis of viral RNA is drastically reduced in cells expressing a functional TAR decoy RNA, but it is unaffected in cells expressing a mutant form of TAR decoy RNA. It is therefore concluded that overexpression of TAR-containing sequences in CEM SS cells interferes with the process of Tat-mediated transactivation of viral gene expression. However, the phenotype of several mutations suggests that TAR decoy RNA does not inhibit HIV- 1 gene expression by simply sequestering Tat but rather does so by sequestering a transactivation protein complex, implying that transactivation requires the cooperative binding of both Tat and a loop-binding cellular factor(s) to TAR.

To explore whether the viral protease (PR) could be expressed as a proteolytically active fusion protein, the HIVPRcoding region was fused in-frame with the HIV- 2 vpxand HIV- 1 vprgenes. Using a vaccinia virus-T 7 expression system, the Vpx-PR fusion protein was expressed and formed homodimers. Coexpression with Pr 55 Gagdemonstrated that Vpx-PR possessed Gag-specific proteolytic activity and inhibited the production of Gag virus-like particles. Trans-expression of a PR-Vpr fusion protein with HIV- 1 provirus caused a profound reduction in viral protein expression and virion production. Importantly, the PR-Vpr fusion protein caused a similar level of inhibition and intracellular cleavage of Pr 55 Gagprecursor protein when coexpressed with protease defective HIV- 1 provirus.

40|$|Effective {{antiviral}} agents will be {{of great}} value in controlling virus replication and delaying the onset of HIV- 1 -related disease symptoms. Current therapy {{involves the use of}} antiviral agents that target the enzymatic functions of the virus, resulting in the emergence of resistant viruses to these agents, thus lowering their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we have considered the idea of developing novel agents from within HIV- 1 as inhibitors of virus replication. The specificity of the Vpr protein for the HIV- 1 virus particle makes it an attractive molecule for the development of antiviral agents targeting the events associated with virus maturation. We have generated chimeric Vpr proteins containing HIV- 1 -specific sequences added to the C terminus of Vpr. These sequences correspond to nine cleavage sites of the Gag and Gag–Pol precursors of HIV- 1. The chimeric Vpr constructs were introduced into HIV- 1 proviral DNA to assess their effect on virus infectivity using single- and multiple-round replication assays. The virus particles generated exhibited a variable replication pattern depending on the protease cleavage site used as a fusion partner. Interestingly, the chimeric Vpr containing the cleavage sequences from the junction of p 24 and p 2, 24 / 2, completely abolished virus infectivity.

Although this sequence is highly conserved among different clinical strains, {{approximately half of}} chronically infected hepatitis C patients {{do not respond to}} interferon therapy. Therefore, development of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to the 5 'UTR to inhibit IRES mediated translation may represent an alternative approach that could circumvent the problem of interferon resistance. Results Four different plasmid constructs were prepared for intracellular delivery of siRNAs targeting the stem loop II-III of HCV 5 ' UTR. The effect of siRNA production on IRES mediated translation was investigated using chimeric clones between the gene for green fluorescence protein (GFP) and IRES sequences of six different HCV genotypes. The siRNA targeted to stem loop II effectively mediated degradation of HCV IRES mRNA and inhibited GFP expression in the case of six different HCV genotypes, where as siRNAs targeted to stem loop III did not. Furthermore, intracytoplasmic expression of siRNA into transfected Huh- 7 cells efficiently degraded HCV genomic RNA and inhibited core protein expression from infectious full-length infectious clones HCV 1 a and HCV 1 b strains. Conclusion These in vitro studies suggest that siRNA targeted to stem-loop II is highly effective inhibiting IRES mediated translation of the major genotypes of HCV.

Here we describe HIV- 1 -based packaging systems containing the Rev-response element (RRE), of simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} (SIV) {{in place of the}} HIV- 1 RRE. The SIV RRE-containing packaging systems were used to deliver the anti-Rev gene, Rev M 10, into HIV- 1 susceptible target cells. Results An HIV- 1 based packaging system was created using either a 272 - or 1045 -nucleotide long RRE derived from the molecular clone SIVmac 239. The 1045 -nucleotide SIV RRE-containing HIV- 1 packaging system provided titers comparable to that of the HIV- 1 RRE-based one. Moreover, despite the use of HIV- 1 Rev for production of vector stocks, this packaging system was found to be relatively refractory to the inhibitory effects of Rev M 10. Correspondingly, the SIV RRE-based packaging system provided 34 - to 130 -fold higher titers than the HIV- 1 RRE one when used for packaging a gene transfer vector encoding Rev-M 10. Jurkat T-cells, gene modified with Rev M 10 encoding HIV- 1 vectors, upon challenge with replication defective HIV- 1 in single-round infection experiments, showed diminished production of virus particles. Conclusion A simple modification of an HIV- 1 gene delivery system, namely, replacement of HIV- 1 RRE with that of SIV, allowed efficient delivery of Rev M 10 transgene into T-cell lines for <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> against HIV- 1 replication. </p...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{efficient}} method for the inhibition of bacteriophage phi 29 assembly was developed {{with the use}} of mutant forms of the viral procapsid (or packaging) RNA (pRNA) indispensable for phi 29 DNA packaging. Phage phi 29 assembly was severely reduced in vitro in the presence of mutant pRNA and completely blocked in vivo when the host cell expressed mutant pRNA. Addition of 45 % mutant pRNA resulted in a reduction of infectious virion production by 4 orders of magnitude, indicating that factors involved in viral assembly can be targets for efficient and specific antiviral treatment. The mechanism leading to the high efficiency of inhibition was attributed to two pivotal features. First, the pRNA contains two separate, essential functional domains, one for procapsid binding and the other for a DNA-packaging role other than procapsid binding. Mutation of the DNA-packaging domain resulted in a pRNA with no DNA-packaging activity but intact procapsid binding competence. Second, multiple copies of the pRNA were involved in the packaging of one genome. This higher-order dependence of pRNA in viral replication concomitantly resulted in its higher-order inhibitory effect. This finding suggested that the collective DNA-packaging activity of multiple copies of pRNA could be disrupted by the incorporation of perhaps an individual mutant pRNA into the group. Although this mutant pRNA could not be used for the inhibition of the replication of other viruses directly, the principle of using molecules with two functional domains and multiple-copy involvement as targets for antiviral agents could be applied to certain viral structural proteins, enzymes, and other factors or RNAs involved in the viral life cycle. This principle also implies a strategy for gene therapy, <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization,</b> or construction of transgenic plants resistant to viral infection...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Farmácia (Microbiologia), apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa através da Faculdade de Farmácia, 2008 The {{spread of}} HIV- 1 has been {{dramatic}} {{since the early}} eighties, when the virus was discovered as the causative agent of AIDS. In {{the absence of an}} effective vaccine against HIV, a worldwide search has been made {{in the past two decades}} to develop small-molecule inhibitors to target essential steps in the viral cycle. Over the recent years, gene therapy has been highly regarded as a new form of molecular medicine in treatment of HIV/AIDS, either asan alternative or as a complement to anti-retroviral chemotherapy. An intrabody consists of an antibody designed to be expressed intracellularly and directed to different subcellular compartments where they can exert their function more effectively. The binding of an intrabody to its molecular target has the potential to block, suppress, alter or even enhance the process mediated by that molecule. Within this context, intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) represent a new class of neutralizing molecules with potential use in gene therapy approaches. The HIV 1 integrase (IN) protein is currently the focus of an intense research effort to develop new anti-HIV- 1 drugs. This enzyme catalyses the integration of HIV genome into the chromosome of the host cell, arguably the most insidious step in the infection process. In the first project of this thesis (Chapter 2), we explored the <b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization</b> approach by developing rabbit intrabodies against the HIV- 1 IN protein. We immunized rabbits with HIV- 1 IN and developed a combinatorial scFv library againstIN. We were able to identify 5 different scFv's antibodies with high binding activity and specificity to IN. These scFv's bound simultaneously to the catalytic and C-terminus domains of IN. In addition, these antibodies have the ability to inhibit the strand transfer processing. Intrabody-expressing cells, either in their cytoplasm or nuclear compartments, were highly resistant to HIV- 1 infection. Importantly, when HIV- 1 particles where produced in the presence of anti-IN scFv, the expression of intrabodies did not affect virion production significantly. However, it markedly reduced the infectivity of progeny virions due to the incorporation of anti-IN scFv into the viral particles. These findings provide proof-in-principle that rabbit anti- IN intrabodies can be designed to block early and late stages of HIV- 1 replication. As a result, our intrabodies might be useful agents for "intracellular immunization"- and used as new tools to study the structure and function of HIV- 1 IN due to their epitope binding characteristics. Another potential target for HIV- 1 treatment is Vif. This viral protein overcomes the innate antiviral activity of a cytidine deaminase APOBEC 3 G that induces G to A hypermutation in the viral genome, resulting in enhancement of viral replication infectivity. We previously demonstrated that anti-Vif scFv and camelized VH intrabodies are an effective approach to inhibit this crucial step of the viral replication cycle. In the second project of this thesis (Chapter 3), we showed that the rabbit VL domain can also be very potentially used as an intrabody. Our results demonstrate that the anti- Vif VL single-domain preserve the antigen-binding activity and specificity in the absence of the parent VH domain. In addition, the VL single domain was highly expressed in microbial cell culture and show favourable biophysical properties. The expression of the VL intrabody in eukaryotic cells also showed that the rabbit VL was correctly folded as soluble protein in the reducing environment and could strongly neutralize HIV- 1 infectivity. Therefore, the present study suggests that rabbit VL single-domains have also an enormous value as intracellular antigen recognition units. Lentiviral vectors are among the most efficient tools for gene delivery into mammalian cells. A major goal of lentiviral gene delivery systems is to develop vectors that can efficiently target specific cell types. In the last project of this thesis (Chapter 4), we attempted to generate viral particles for targeting gene delivery. To achieve this goal we have used CCR 5 -positive cells as the target for our strategy. We designed a novel Sindbis pseudotyped vector where the Sindbis E 2 receptor binding envelope protein was modified to directly encode a scFv against the CCR 5 chemokine receptor. Targeting into specific cells was mediated by the anti-CCR 5 scFv display, and viral titers were close to 106 EGFP transduction units/ml. Our data demonstrate that the length of the peptide linker that connects the heavy chain and light chain of anti-CCR 5 scFv significantly affects the efficiency of infection. Infection levels obtained with Sindbis envelope displaying a scFv with a longer linker was consistently higher than that with Sindbis envelope displaying a scFv with a short linker. The results presented show that chimeric scFv-Sindbis pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have the potential to become an efficient and broadly applicable approach for targeting gene delivery to specific cells. Furthermore, this strategy has the potential to become a powerful approach for targeting gene delivery in anti- HIV gene therapy due to the important role of CCR 5 expression in disease progression.

40|$|Mit der Einführung der hochaktiven antiretroviralen Therapie (HAART) 1995 wandelte sich die HIV-Infektion in den Industrieländern von einer akut lebensbedrohlichen zu einer chronisch verlaufenden und scheinbar gut kontrollierten Erkrankung. Das Virus wird allerdings nie vollständig aus dem Körper eliminiert, sodass die Betroffenen zeitlebens Medikamente einnehmen müssen. Die Langzeit-Medikation wird häufig von schweren Nebenwirkungen begleitet, führt zur Selektion resistenter Viren und muss häufig umgestellt werden. Gentherapeutische Verfahren, die die CD 4 + Zielzellen durch die Expression antiviraler Gene vor der Infektion durch HIV schützen („intrazelluläre Immunisierung“), stellen viel versprechende Therapiealternativen dar. Der in der Arbeitsgruppe von Laer entwickelte retrovirale Vektor M 87 o (EGELHOFER et al. 2004, EGELHOFER 2004) exprimiert das 46 Aminosäuren lange membran-verankerte Peptid C 46, das in der Lage ist, die gp 41 -vermittelte Fusion von Virus- und Zellmembran zu inhibieren. In Zelllinien und primären Lymphozyten konnte gezeigt werden, dass M 87 o die Infektion durch unterschiedliche HIV-Isolate sehr effektiv verhindert. Im Rahmen vorklinischer Untersuchungen konnte {{in vitro}} gezeigt werden, dass die retrovirale Transduktion mit M 87 o das Transformationsrisiko und damit das Risiko der Entstehung von Neoplasien nicht steigert. An primären peripheren T-Zellen konnte zeigt werden, dass M 87 o die Zielzellen weder phänotypische noch funktionelle verändert. Für die Untersuchung der retroviralen Gentherapie im Rhesusaffenmodell wurde zunächst ein Gentransferprotokoll für periphere Affenlymphozyten entwickelt, mit dem in Vorversuchen Gentransferraten von ca. 50 % erreicht werden konnten. Das Transduktionsprotokoll wurde anschließend im Rahmen einer präklinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Immunogenität der M 87 o-Gentherapie, bei der Herstellung zweier Studientransplantate angewandt. Beide Zellpräparate wurden den Versuchstieren transplantiert. Während des Eingriffs traten keine akuttoxischen Reaktionen auf. M 87 o+-Zellen konnten bis 140 Tage nach der Transplantation mittels PCR nachgewiesen werden. Immunologische Untersuchungen (Cytokinfärbung, Proliferationsassay, ELISPOT) ergaben keine Hinweise auf zelluläre oder humorale Immunreaktionen. M 87 o-spezifische Antikörper waren im Serum nicht nachweisbar. Für die Durchführung einer klinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Wirksamkeit (Phase I/II) an HIV-infizierten Probanden wurde ein Protokoll zur Produktion M 87 o-modifizierter T-Zellen (mindestens 5 × 108 M 87 o+ CD 4 -T-Zellen pro Spender) entwickelt. In die klinische Prüfung wurden Patienten aufgenommen, die nach multiplem Therapieversagen durch das Auftreten multiresistenter HIV eine CD 4 -Zellzahl von 50 bis 200 µl- 1 Blut, sowie eine Viruslast von > 5. 000 Kopien ml- 1 Blut aufwiesen. Im Versuchsmaßstab konnte ein Transduktionsprotokoll erarbeitet werden, mit dem im Mittel 46 % der CD 4 + T-Zellen mit M 87 o transduziert werden konnten. Innerhalb von 10 Tagen expandierte die Zellzahl im Mittel um den Faktor 153, wobei die HIV-Replikation vollständig inhibiert wurde. Das Protokoll wurde erfolgreich vom Versuchsmaßstab in den klinisch relevanten Produktionsmaßstab übersetzt. In drei Versuchsläufen wurde im Mittel eine Transduktionsrate von 29 % erreicht und die Zellzahl um den Faktor 44 vermehrt. Der Anteil an CD 3 +/CD 4 + Zellen an der Gesamtpopulation lag im Mittel bei 91 %. Insgesamt konnten mit dem etablierten Protokoll durchschnittlich 2, 3 × 109 CD 3 +/CD 4 +/M 87 o+ Zellen, bei gleichzeitig vollständiger Inhibition der HIV-Replikation, generiert werden. Im Rahmen einer klinischen Studie zur Toxizität und Wirksamkeit der M 87 o-Gentherapie wurden 10 Studientransplantate gemäß dem im Rahmen dieser Arbeit entwickelten Protokoll hergestellt. Alle Transplantate wurden am Universitäts-Krankenhaus Eppendorf in Hamburg transfundiert und von den Patienten sehr gut vertragen. With the {{introduction}} of the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) in 1995 the HIV infection converted from an acute life threatening diseased into an apparently well controlled chronicle disease. The virus is in fact not completely eliminated for the body of the patient, thus the affected need to be treated lifelong. Long time medication is in many cases accompanied by serious side effects, leads to selection of resistant virus and therefore therapy has to be changed frequently. Gene therapeutic approaches that efficiently save the CD 4 -positive target cell population from the HIV infection by expression of anti-viral genes (<b>intracellular</b> <b>immunization)</b> could offer promising therapeutic alternatives. The retroviral vector M 87 o (EGELHOFER et al. 2004, EGELHOFER 2004) developed in the group of Prof. VON LAER at the Georg-Speyer-Haus in Frankfurt, Germany, expresses a membrane-anchored peptide, 46 amino acids long, that is able to inhibit gp 41 -mediated fusion of the virus and host cell membrane. It could be shown that M 87 o is able to inhibit the infection of T cell lines as well as primary lymphocytes by different HIV isolates. In the context of non-clinical investigations, it could be shown in vitro that transduction with M 87 o does not increase the risk of transformation and therefore does not increase the risk of neoplasia. It was demonstrated that M 87 o does not alter T cells with respect to phenotype and function. To support the investigation of the M 87 o gene therapy in a rhesus monkey model, a gene transfer protocol for peripheral monkey lymphocytes was developed able to achieve a gene transfer rate of approximately 50 %. This protocol was consecutively applied {{in the context of a}} non-clinical study for investigation of toxicity and immunogenicity of the M 87 o gene therapy for production of two study transplants. Both cell products were transplanted without acute toxic reactions. M 87 o-positive T cells could be detected for up to 140 days by means of PCR. Immunological investigations did not give any hind on cellular of humoral immune reactions. M 87 o specific antibodies could not be detected in the serum of the animals. To support a clinical trial for investigation of toxicity and efficacy of the M 87 o gene therapy in HIV infected volunteers, a protocol for production of M 87 o-modified T cells (minimum requirement: 5 x 108 M 87 o-positive CD 4 T cells per donor) was developed. Into this clinical trial, patients with a history of multiple therapy failure due to multi resistant HIV, a CD 4 cell count of 50 to 200 cells per µl of blood, and a virus load greater than 5, 000 per ml of blood were enrolled. First a transduction protocol that allowed genetic modification of at mean 46 % of CD 4 T cells was developed at experimental scale. During 10 days of culture cell number multiplier by 153 with complete inhibition of viral replication. The protocol was than successfully transferred from the experimental scale to the clinically relevant production scale. During three production campaigns a mean transduction rate of 29 % was achieved and cells expanded 44 -fold in number. At mean 91 % cells of the total population were positive for CD 3 as well as CD 4. With the established protocol on average 2, 3 x 109 CD 3 +/CD 4 +/M 87 o+ cells could be generated. HIV replication was completely inhibited in parallel. In the context of a clinical trial for investigation of toxicity and efficacy of the M 87 o gene therapy, ten study transplants were generated according to the protocol established during this work. All cell preparations were transplanted at the university hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, and tolerated very well by the recipients...|$|E
