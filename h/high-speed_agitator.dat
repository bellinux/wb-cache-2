50|$|Which {{ingredients}} are chosen also relies {{on how the}} mascara is manufactured. Today, {{there are two main}} methods of production. The first is referred to as anhydrous. In this method all waxes, oils, and pigments are mixed, heated, and agitated simultaneously in formulated ratios. The result is a semi-solid substance that is ready to be placed in tubes, packaged, shipped and sold. The other method used is termed emulsion. The emulsion method also results in a semi-solid substance, but its procedure greatly differs. In the emulsion method, water and thickeners are first combined. Separately, waxes and emulsifiers are mixed and heated. Pigment is then added individually to both mixtures. Finally all is combined in a homogenizer, which acts as a <b>high-speed</b> <b>agitator</b> in order to thoroughly mix the oils, water, waxes, and emulsifiers—ingredients that naturally repulse each other.|$|E
40|$|Dependence {{of thermal}} {{shrinkage}} of films based on polyvinylchloride (PVC) on temperature is established. The technique of determining PVC film shrinkage speed within a wide interval of temperatures is developed. The {{effect of the}} content of the plasticizer and heat treatment on the physicomechanical parameters of PVC films is shown. The influence of the duration of mixing the components of the mix on physico-mechanical parameters of PVC films is established. Linear equations of regression of temperature rise kinetics in the course of mixing the ingredients in a <b>high-speed</b> <b>agitator</b> and those of subsequent kinetics of cooling the mix at mixing are obtained...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{expression}} profiles and antigenicities of both culture filtrates (CF) and cellular extracts (CE) of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), one-dimensional electrophoresis (1 -DE) and 2 -DE immunoblotting, and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). The CF proteins were harvested from supernatants of stationary-phase liquid cultures and concentrated by size exclusion filtration. The CE proteins were extracted by mechanical disruption of cells using glass beads and a <b>high-speed</b> <b>agitator.</b> Analysis of SDS-PAGE gels showed {{that the majority of}} CF proteins had low molecular masses (< 50 kDa), whereas CE protein mass ranged more evenly over a broader range up to 100 kDa. By 2 -DE, CF proteins had a narrow array of pI values, with most being between pH 4. 0 and 5. 5; CE proteins spanned pI values from pH 4. 0 to 7. 0. The antigenicities of CF and CE proteins were first determined by 1 -DE and 2 -DE immunoblotting with serum from a cow naturally infected with M. paratuberculosis. The serum reacted strongly to more proteins in the CF than the CE. Sera from 444 infected and 412 uninfected cattle were tested by ELISA with CF and CE as solid-phase antigens. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis of the ELISA results showed a significantly greater area under the curve for CF compared to CE (P < 0. 05). A high degree of variability in protein binding patterns was shown with 1 -DE immunoblot analysis with 31 sera from M. paratuberculosis-infected cattle. Collectively, these results indicate that serologic tests for bovine paratuberculosis may be improved by using proteins derived from CF instead of CE. To maximize the diagnostic sensitivity of serologic tests, multiple proteins will be required. Even so, a CF ELISA {{may not be able to}} detect all M. paratuberculosis-infected cattle, in particular those in the early stages of infection that have yet to mount an antibody response...|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonication offers great {{potential}} in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials {{as well as for}} the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to <b>high-speed</b> mixers and <b>agitator</b> bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this sonochemical (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel.|$|R
40|$|Bone {{charcoal}} is a carbonaceous substance, {{which is}} derived from the carbonization of selected grades of animal bones by heating dry bones in an airtight iron retort at 500 - 700 ℃ for about 4 - 6 hours. Comparing the capacity of metal ions removal with activated carbon, bone charcoal not only provides a porous carbon surface for physical adsorption, but also provides a hydroxyapatite lattice - Cal 0 (PO 4) (OH) 2 for ion exchange of metal ions. Based on these properties, this sorbent should have excellent adsorption capacities for metal ions. In this research, the sorption equilibrium and the sorption kinetics of metal ions from solution onto bone charcoal were studied. To study the sorption capacity, the sorption equilibrium of cadmium, copper and zinc ions onto bone char has been investigated. The pH of metal ion solutions were controlled at 4. 8 ± 0. 1. The test temperature was controlled at 20 ± 2 ℃. The experimental results were substituted into several single component isotherm equations (the Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson equations) and the Langmuir-Freundlich equation was found to be the most appropriate isotherm model to describe the sorption equilibrium of metal ions onto bone char. The sorption capacity of bone char for cadmium, copper and zinc at an equilibrium metal concentration of 3. 0 mmole/dm 3 was found to be 0. 57 mmole/g, 0. 79 mmole/g and 0. 56 mmole/g, respectively. To study the kinetics of metal ion removal, the commonly accepted method of using an agitated batch sorber was adopted. The solution containing metal ions was agitated by the <b>high-speed</b> <b>agitator.</b> The sorbent was added into the sorber to remove the metal ion. The removal rate of metal ions by the adsorbent can be determined and plotted against time. The experimental data were analyzed by four reaction kinetic equations (Pseudo-first order, Pseudo-second order, Elovich and Modified second order equation). Based on the single component test results, the most appropriate reaction kinetic model can be determined by mathematical modeling and comparing theoretically predicted data with the experimental data points. In this research, the Elovich equation was found to be the best fitting equation to describe the sorption kinetics of metal ions onto bone char...|$|E
