5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close binary system can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn's {{primary focus}} was on reforms to the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the state penitentiary, {{although}} the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black <b>Hole</b> <b>of</b> Calcutta.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, deep <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> Reed-Solomon (RS) {{codes are}} studied. A new class <b>of</b> deep <b>holes</b> for {{generalized}} affine RS codes is given if the evaluation set satisfies certain combinatorial structure. Three classes <b>of</b> deep <b>holes</b> for projective Reed-Solomon (PRS) codes are constructed explicitly. In particular, deep <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> PRS codes with redundancy three are completely obtained when the {{characteristic of the}} finite field is odd.

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and the transition from the <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E

The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E

5|$|Also {{known as}} Nova Muscae 1983, GQ Muscae is a binary system {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and small star that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated the star erupts, {{as it did in}} 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object {{consisting of a}}n orange main-sequence star (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> around 6 solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced through a process of positron annihilation. GR Muscae is an X-ray source composed of a neutron star of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY Muscae is a symbiotic star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, there is no periodic eruption nor accretion disc formed. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days.|$|E
5|$|In 1712, the British {{completed}} {{the construction of}} Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory. Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William {{which led to the}} killings of several East India company officials in the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>of</b> Calcutta. A force of Company soldiers (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province. Declared a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1772. In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control {{of the city and the}} province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture. Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 match {{continued}} {{the trend of}} American victories, as the United States won 23½–8½ at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match {{came down to the}} last <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> the final singles match between American Jack Nicklaus and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18½–13½. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E
