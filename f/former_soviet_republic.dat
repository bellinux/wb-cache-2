5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads.

While admiring the underlying ideas behind Euromaidan and being touched by the reception that the Bulgarians received, Ivaylo Dinev, one of the most recognizable figures behind the occupation, in retrospect expressed sadness about how the anti-Yanukovych protests turned out due to the human casualties and the Ukrainian people eventually being pitted against each other rather than banding together to confront the national and global elites.|$|E

These nations are spending their dignity and resources on the crimes and threats of the Zionist network against their will.”Ahmadinejad stated the “Zionist regime” was on the path to collapse and that the [...] "underhanded actions of the Zionists" [...] as among the causes of the recent unrest in the <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>republic</b> of Georgia. In a subsequent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ahmadinejad stated that [...] "The [...] regime resembles an airplane that has lost its engine and is kind of going down.

Who {{in the real world}} of serious {{diplomacy}} shows up in Geneva with a red plastic toy reset button, complete with a mistranslated Russian label? When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, but he does have a general sense {{that there are a lot}} more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next." [...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>republic,</b> as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E
