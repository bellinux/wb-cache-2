The GVAR approach enables us to make two key contributions: first, to model international linkages among a large number of countries, which is a key asset given the diversity of countries and regions involved in global imbalances, and second, to model exports and imports jointly. The latter proves to be very important due to the internationalization of production chains. The model can be used to gauge the <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> of various scenarios, such as an output shock in the United States, a shock to the US real effective exchange rate and shocks to foreign (e. g., German and Chinese) variables.

Additionally, we employ the bounds testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modelling that is suitable for the models used mostly {{because it does not}} require pre-unit-root testing and variables in the model could be stationary, non-stationary or a combination of the two.

In this paper, we assume the adoption of new transport technology when trade increases and show that, given the standard effect of a PTA on regional trade, the welfare would be higher than that usually claimed due to the induced effect on the regional transport network. Moreover, {{there is evidence that}} with such sunk costs in transportation, the sequence of trade liberalisation matters: the free trade achieved under a regional PTA would lead to permanently higher welfare than the one achieved under multilateral liberalisation.
