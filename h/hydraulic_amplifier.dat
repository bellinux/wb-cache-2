40|$|In {{this work}} {{the concept of}} {{hydraulic}} amplification {{as a means of}} stroke amplification is explored for applications in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). Building on the batch fabrication technologies of the semiconductor industry, MEMS technology could enable the simultaneous fabrication of multiple microhydraulic systems of which hydraulic amplifiers would form part. Precision lithography would furthermore make dense arrays of microhydraulic systems possible, with the eventual goal being to create high power density microscale actuation and power generation systems. This document provides an overview of the design considerations required for a successful microfabricated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and proceeds to discuss the techniques developed to successfully fabricate, assemble and test such a device. Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) techniques were developed for creating strong tethered membrane structures using Silicon On Insulator (SOI) technology. Bonding techniques included silicon-silicon fusion bonding of fragile wafers and silicon-glass anodic bonding and alignment on the wafer and die level to produce multi-layered structures. Liquid filling of micromachined dead volumes through micron-size channels was performed. Static sealing techniques for leak-free sealing of micromachined, filled dead volumes with minimal seal compression and dynamic sealing techniques when quasi-static actuation is not a prerequisite were successfully developed. Using these techniques, several hydraulic amplification devices have been produced. Testing of these devices revealed good correlation with theoretical predictions. Stroke amplification ratios as high as 48 : 1 have been observed. In addition, natural frequencies of up to 10 kHz were measured. In conclusion, this work verifies the viability of hydraulic amplification for applications in microscale actuation systems. by J. Lodewyk Steyn. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the concept of Single Well Imaging (SWI) in which a seismic source and {{receivers}} are deployed in a borehole to investigate the surrounding geology. The Uniwell project (1997 - 1999) was the first attempt to develop the SWI method; it used a fluid-coupled downhole source, which unfortunately generated high amplitude guided waves in the borehole which obscured all other useful information. Initial research work detailed in this thesis focused on removing the high amplitude guided waves, known as tube waves. Two-step source signature deconvolution using first the recorded source signature, and then the tube-wave reflected {{from the bottom of the}} well, succeeded in compressing the tube wave. The results were not consistent across all receivers, but there is enough correlation to identify a P-wave. Further work concentrates on using a new technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition to separate the tube-wave mode from the data. This identifies three dominant modes and a possible body wave arrival, but the results are ambiguous due to the inability of the decomposition to focus on the narrow bandwidth of interest. The source signature deconvolution technique can also be used to process real-time vertical seismic profiling (VSP) data down-hole, during pauses in drilling, in what is referred to as a Seismic-While-Drilling (SWD) setup. Results show that the technique is versatile and robust, giving 1 ms precision on first-break picking even in very noisy data. I also apply the technique to normal VSP data to improve both the resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. A major effort in this thesis is to consider the effect of a clamped downhole source to overcome the tube-wave problem, using a magnetostrictive source. Earlier work established that the use of a reaction mass tended to excite resonances in the tool which caused the transducer to break. A new design for the source was developed in cooperation with colleagues which utilises a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>amplifier</b> design and a low power coded waveform driving method exploiting the time-bandwidth product to extract the signal from the noise. My results show that as the run time increases the resolution improves. With a run length of 80 s it is possible to resolve the signal transmitted 50 cm through a granite formation. This analysis led to a revised design of the source to improve its efficiency. I have used finite difference modelling, with a variable grid technique, to compare an ideal explosive source with an ideal clamped source. The fluid-coupled source emits high amplitude tube waves which virtually obscure the body wave, whereas the clamped source emits a clearly identifiable P-wave along with lower amplitude tube waves. This clearly illustrates the advantage of an ideal clamped source. To model the source more accurately the idealwavelet is replaced by the respective recorded source signatures, and the data is then processed by cross correlation with the appropriate signature. The results show that the coded waveform approaches the resolution of the ideal wavelet very well, with all major events being visible. However, the fluid-coupled source performs very poorly with only the highest amplitude tube-wave visible. This work illustrates that by replacing a fluid-coupled source by a clamped source driven by a coded waveform, and by processing the data using cross correlation or signature deconvolution, it is possible to minimise or eliminate tube-wave noise from a SWI survey. It is hoped that the results outlined here will provide the basis for a new SWI method than can be used to prolong the supply of North Sea oil...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is designed to}} investigate electrohydraulic servo-valves with mechanical feedback, excluding the efects of lap conditions and flow forces on the spool. Equilibrium of the armature-flapper assembly is modelled using exact expressions of the decentering magnetic torque on the armature and the hydruulic reaction on theflapper. Evidence is furnished that the feedback wire stirness must not be constant as it is usually assumed. The parameters used to describe this hitherto unidentified non-linearity are accurately determined by computer simulation. This phenomenon is furthermore found to account for anomalies observed in the no-loadjow gain characteristics of similar valves. Thus, a new criterion for quality and per$ormance of electrohydraulic servo-valves could be established. Derivation of the stall-pressure gain characteristics offirst-stage <b>hydraulic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> including a drain orifice is given in the Appendix. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} circuit {{is a system}} comprising an interconnected set of discrete components that transport liquid. The purpose of this system may be to control where fluid flows (as in a network of tubes of coolant in a thermodynamic system) or to control fluid pressure (as in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>amplifiers).</b> For example, <b>hydraulic</b> machinery uses {{hydraulic circuit}}s (in which hydraulic fluid is pushed, under pressure, through hydraulic pumps, pipes, tubes, hoses, hydraulic motors, hydraulic cylinders, and so on) to move heavy loads. The approach of describing a fluid system in terms of discrete components is inspired {{by the success of}} electrical circuit theory. Just as electric circuit theory works when elements are discrete and linear, hydraulic circuit theory works best when the elements (passive component such as pipes or transmission lines or active components such as power packs or pumps) are discrete and linear. This usually means that hydraulic circuit analysis works best for long, thin tubes with discrete pumps, as found in chemical process flow systems or microscale devices.|$|R

40|$|A new, {{intrinsically}} passive controller for <b>hydraulic</b> human power <b>amplifier</b> is presented. The <b>hydraulic</b> human power <b>amplifier</b> is a {{tool that}} amplifies (or attenuates) the force that the human exerts on it. The control objective is to cause the system to behave like a passive mechanical tool when interacting with the human and with the work environment with a specified power scaling factor. Although a previous Proportional-integral with velocity feedforward force controller [1] works well in the constrained space, it lacks robustness or performance during freemotion because of the sensitivity {{to the implementation of}} velocity feedforward term. The difficulty in implementing the velocity feedforward term also prevents the controller from being intrinsically passive. The new controller recasts the human power amplifier problem into one of velocity coordination by generating a fictitious reference mechanical system. Force amplification become a natural consequence of velocity coordination. This enables the controller to be intrinsically passive and to achieve good performance both in free motion and constrained motion. These properties have been experimentally validated. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{two-stage}} shear-modulated <b>hydraulic</b> vortex <b>amplifier</b> (U. S. patent 3, 520, 317) {{has been}} fabricated and put through preliminary steady-state testing at the 1000 psi supply pressure level with flows up to 15 gpm. The invention comprises a conventional fluidic vortex power stage and a shear-modulated pilot stage. In {{the absence of}} any mechanical moving parts, water may be used as the hydraulic medium thus opening the way to many underseas applications. At blocked load, a control input from 0 to 150 psi was required to achieve an output from 0 to 900 psi; at wide-open load, a control input of 0 to 120 psi was needed to achieve an output from 0 to 15 gpm. The power stage has been found unsuitable for the proportional control mode because of its nonlinear performance in the intermediate load range and because of strong pressure fluctuations (plus or minus 150 psi) in the intermediate control range. The addition of the shear-modulated pilot stage improves intermediate load linearity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In recent years, piezo-actuated micro/nano posi-tioning stages {{emerge as}} a {{significant}} tool in the nanotechnology. However, the shortcomings of small positioning stroke and hysteresis of piezoelectric actuators have constrained their further development and applications. In this paper, a novel piezo-actuated <b>hydraulic</b> displacement <b>amplifier</b> (PHDA) based on Pascal’s law and area differential principle is first proposed aiming to solve the contradictions among positioning stroke, positioning resolution and mechanism dimension in piezo-actuated micro/nano positioning stages. After a series of optimal designs, the proposed PHDA mechanism is fabricated and experimentally tested. In this study, a piezoelectric (PZT) actuator P- 840. 20 with open-loop travel of 30 µm is employed, the experimental {{results indicate that the}} displacement am-plification ratio can reach up to 34. 6, thus the maximum output displacement can achieve up to around 1. 02 mm. Both theoretical derivation and prototype test results testify the well performance of the proposed mechanism. This new amplifier can be widely extended to practical precision manipulation applications in case of large motion range required. I...|$|R
