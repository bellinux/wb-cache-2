5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a faster rate than most northern states.|$|E
30|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} as to whether migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their personal or professional lives was very homogenous. Most of the participants, 143, answered that migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their personal and professional lives while 10 of them answered the opposite, that migration did not improve their lives. Some of the answers were determined by personal improvements and other answers focused on professional, educational and social improvements. For instance, 45 of the women agreed that migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their family lives, 59 of the women answered that migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their entrepreneurial activities with new opportunities to expand their business, 16 considered that migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their professional lives, 6 of them answered that migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their education and 16 of them agreed on how migration <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> their social life (Table  4).|$|R

The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education, family, health, and business.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} figures <b>have</b> <b>improved,</b> median {{incomes and}} stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|Although press freedoms <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special {{interests}} and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E

5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E

While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries.

As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy.

5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski {{to draft}} a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych).

The Code would also <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
