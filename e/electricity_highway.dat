40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of the impact of extensive deployment of local and external renewable energy sources in the Sardinian power system and discusses the main challenges faced in integrating current and forecasted high shares of renewable-based generation technologies. It presents the 2030 scenarios for the Sardinian grid and the results of steady-state analyses in extreme renewable generation and consumption conditions. These results are finally combined with the option for further interconnections with North Africa and Europe. A new HVDC link between Algeria and Sardinia to export solar energy from the South to the North of the Mediterranean is envisaged following the EU Supergrid projects. In general, the article stresses that accommodating high renewable energy penetration not only requires reinforcing the <b>electricity</b> <b>highways</b> but also demands carefully planning the architecture and the interface with regional power systems.

40|$|According to {{the recent}} European Climate Foundation (ECF) study, the {{planning}} of European transmission network {{plays a crucial role}} in the realization of the European single electricity market and the de-carbonization process of the electricity sector for the coming 40 years. The transmission grid has to cope with a strong international influence. International trade between different tariff zones increased over the last decade. Large scale integration of renewable energy sources introduced severe loop flows in the European power system. In the past years, new coordination organizations have been given birth within Europe to ease the Transmission System operations (like TSC or CORESO). These legal entities have been given rights and duties to facilitate network management on a daily basis. It is expected that new grid architectures will give rise to even more complex issues relating to the transnational aspects of <b>electricity</b> <b>highways</b> (financing and ownership, cost allocation, roles of supranational organizations, etc.). It will call for adapting existing policies at the European and national levels in order to achieve a high level of social welfare. It is therefore of paramount importance to address governance model issues based on lessons learnt from previous transnational governance models within EU 27, and possibly beyond, befor...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of deployment synergies across infrastructure networks of different industries {{has been identified}} as a key to improve the broadband business case. Thus, an increasing number of broadband plans require owners of physical infrastructures such as the <b>electricity,</b> pipeline, <b>highway</b> and railroad networks to host broadband infrastructure. However, cross-industry cooperation brings about new complexity to optimal {{utilization of}} deployment synergies. This paper explores cost savings that can be achieved if national non-telecommunication infrastructures are considered as source for broadband networks in rural areas. Moreover, it assesses economic, political and regulatory measures required for improving synergy utilization. The presented approach is based on a techno-economic broadband deployment model, which is applied to all rural communities in Germany. Results indicate that synergy optimized network topologies can generally decrease rural broadband deployment cost. However, it is required that local authorities recognize the definition of broadband tender areas as a chance for the aggregation of demand. Moreover, national regulators need to ensure that metro-aggregation, backbone and co-location costs, which are associated with non-telecommunication infrastructures, do not exceed the costs of the incumbent by more than 50 %...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} investigating the difficulties {{to reap the}} intended benefits from liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries. This issue is tackled through the 'theoretical lenses' of new institutional economics, in particular by applying the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The study is a comparative analysis of liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries within the same country context. In Italy, various reforms of network industries have been made and implemented during the 1990 s and 2000 s, especially in water, gas, <b>electricity,</b> telecommunications, railways, <b>highways,</b> local public transports, and urban solid waste. These reforms generally resulted in greater or lesser degrees of changes of regulatory institutions and industry structure, but in relatively modest competitive pressures on the whole. This analysis suggests that the difficulty to implement liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries in Italy {{may be explained by}} various concurrent mechanisms, which {{have to do with the}} rent-seeking behavior of the actors of the industry's community, the rise of barriers to entry against competitors, and the risk of collusive practices between regulators and regulated. This study suggests some generalizations concerning the effectiveness of reforms intended to open up network industries to competitive pressures...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of energy}} results in {{different}} kinds of emissions and the transportation sector is a large contributor. In todayâs society, for environ-mental and health reasons, it is of high importance to reduce these emissions. In Los Angeles, California, there is a congested highway, the interstate 710, which {{is connected to the}} ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach where a lot of the traffic consists of trucks transporting goods from the ports into the country. To deal with the congestion there is a project called the I- 710 corridor project which is looking into reconstructing the highway with a couple of options. The state of California is among the leaders of reducing the environmental impact from transport and among the options there are suggestions to connect <b>electricity</b> to the <b>highway</b> {{to make it possible for}} electric trucks to fully run on electricity while driving on the I- 710. The purpose of this study was to make a comparison of the environmental impact of trucks driving along I- 710 using the different energy options diesel, which is the most common fuel among trucks today, and electricity in scenarios for the year 2035. This was made by performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) with the help of the programs MOVES and GREET. The results show that using electricity instead of diesel leads to that about a third less energy is needed, about half the amount of greenhouse gases are emitted and that about a fifth up to half of CO, VOC and NOx are emitted while emissions of particulate matter as well as SOx are slightly increased. With these results, the overall finding is that to use electric (hybrid) trucks on the I- 710 instead of diesel trucks is a good option for the environment, both locally and globally...|$|R
