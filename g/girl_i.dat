5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, Insomniac Games began development of Sunset Overdrive. The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank <b>Girl,</b> <b>I</b> Am Legend, The Young One, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset Overdrive was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. Sunset Overdrive was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.|$|E

25|$|After some {{search for}} the <b>girl,</b> <b>I</b> interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

500|$|Newton likely {{introduced}} her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little <b>Girl,</b> <b>I</b> had a friend, who taught me Immortality– but venturing too near, himself– he never returned"—refers to Newton.|$|E

That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson.

500|$|Raised as a girl, Cal views {{himself as}} a girl who likes other girls. His ability to have a [...] "feminine gender schema" [...] despite his having male genes, substantiates the constructionist {{position}} that gender identity is fully dependent on outer influences. However, when Callie discovers {{that he could have}} been raised as a boy, he renounces his female gender, recognizing his chosen gender identity as a male. Disowning the female gender before he learned about masculine traits bolsters the argument for the [...] "essentialist ideology of identity". Cal's embrace of his inherent male identity and renunciation of his childhood female gender identity is articulated when he reflects, [...] "I never felt out of place being a <b>girl,</b> <b>I</b> still don't feel entirely at home among men." ...|$|E

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was skeptical of the lyrical content presented in the song, commenting, [...] "unlike teen-pop stars a whole {{two or three years}} older than he is, Mr. Bieber isn’t shy about planting the seeds of corruption". Marc Hirsh of the Boston Globe said that the song combines the Disney route of songs comparing love to a fairytale, and unintentional comedy in the lines [...] "'Ain’t no chaperones[...] [...] <b>Girl,</b> <b>I</b> promise I’ll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly’ in a song literally about prom." ...|$|E
