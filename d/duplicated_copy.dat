5000|$|When unequal {{crossing}} over creates a gene duplication, the duplicate has 4 evolutionary fates. This {{is due to the}} fact that purifying selection acting on a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> is not very strong. Now that there is a redundant copy, neutral mutations can act on the duplicate. Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a pseudogene. If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy. Neofunctionalization is also a possibility: the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor. If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a subfunctional event occurs. This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy ...|$|E
5000|$|Conserved gene clusters, such as Hox and {{the human}} β-globin gene cluster, may be formed {{as a result of}} the process of gene {{duplication}} and divergence. A gene is duplicated during cell division, so that its descendants have two end-to-end copies of the gene where it had one copy, initially coding for the same protein or otherwise having the same function. In the course of subsequent evolution, they diverge, so that the products they code for have different but related functions, with the genes still being adjacent on the chromosome. Ohno theorized that the origin of new genes during evolution was dependent on gene duplication. If only a single copy of a gene existed in the genome of a species, the proteins transcribed from this gene would be essential to their survival. Because there was only a single copy of the gene, they could not undergo mutations which would potentially result in new genes; however, gene duplication allows essential genes to undergo mutations in the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy,</b> which would ultimately give rise to new genes over the course of evolution. [...] Mutations in the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> were tolerated because the original copy contained genetic information for the essential gene's function. Species who have gene clusters have a selective evolutionary advantage because natural selection must keep the genes together. [...] Over a short span of time, the new genetic information exhibited by the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> of the essential gene would not serve a practical advantage; however, over a long, evolutionary time period, the genetic information in the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> may undergo additional and drastic mutations in which the proteins of the duplicated gene served a different role than those of the original essential gene. Over the long, evolutionary time period, the two similar genes would diverge so the proteins of each gene were unique in their functions. Hox gene clusters, ranging in various sizes, are found among several phyla.|$|E

5000|$|Mutations {{affecting}} OR genes on the chromosome {{are primarily}} responsible {{for the evolution of}} smell. OR genes are grouped in clusters along multiple chromosomes and are responsible for coding respective OR proteins. These proteins contain seven transmembrane domains that are responsible for detecting specific sets of odor molecules. OR genes are located on error-prone regions of the chromosome, and consequently, the DNA of the OR gene is periodically duplicated during crossover. After this duplication event, one of the two genes may mutate and disable its function, rendering it as a pseudogene. Alternatively, the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> may mutate without dysfunctionality, and will continue making the same olfactory receptor but with altered structural changes. This protein adjustment can induce a subtle shift in the range of smells an animal can sense. The diversity of smelling genes present in humans today are attributed to multiple rounds of mutations that have occurred throughout vertebrate evolution. [...] In particular, repeated rounds of gene duplication, deletion, and pseudogene evolution contribute to the variety of OR gene number. Formally known as “birth-and-death evolution”, these dynamics are measured by the number of gains and losses from genes in each branch of the phylogenetic tree in question. Statistical methods can be used to estimate the total number of gains and losses, which can be as large as several hundred per branch of the tree. Moreover, the number of gains and losses can be enormous even if two extant species possess the same gene number (for example, humans and macaques).|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} coalescent-based {{simulation}} tool to generate patterns of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in a wide region encompassing both the original and duplicated genes. Selection on the new <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> and interlocus gene conversion between the two copies are incorporated. This simulation enables us to explore how selection on duplicated copies affects the pattern of SNPs. The fixation of an advantageous <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> causes a strong reduction in polymorphism {{not only in the}} <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> but also in its flanking regions, which is a typical signature of a selective sweep by positive selection. After fixation, polymorphism gradually increases by accumulating neutral mutations and eventually reaches the equilibrium value if there is no gene conversion. When gene conversion is active, the number of SNPs in the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> quickly increases by transferring SNPs from the original copy; therefore, the time when we can recognize the signature of selection is decreased. Because this effect of gene conversion is restricted only to the duplicated region, more power to detect selection is expected if a flanking region to the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> is used...|$|E

40|$|Massese is an Italian {{dairy sheep}} breed {{characterized}} by animals with black skin and horns and black or apparent grey hairs. Owing {{to the presence}} of these two coat colour types, this breed can be considered an interesting model to evaluate the effects of coat colour gene polymorphisms on this phenotypic trait. Two main loci have been already shown to affect coat colour in sheep: Agouti and Extension coding for the agouti signalling protein (ASIP) and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) genes, respectively. The Agouti locus is affected by a large duplication including the ASIP gene that may determine the Agouti white and tan allele (AWt). Other disrupting or partially inactivating mutations have been identified in exon 2 (a deletion of 5 bp, D 5; and a deletion of 9 bp, D 9) and in exon 4 (g. 5172 T. A, p. C 126 S) of the ASIP gene. Three missense mutations in the sheep MC 1 R gene cause the dominant black ED allele (p. M 73 K and p. D 121 N) and the putative recessive e allele (p. R 67 C). Here, we analysed these ASIP and MC 1 R mutations in 161 Massese sheep collected from four flocks. The presence of one <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> allele including the ASIP gene was associated with grey coat colour (P 59. 4 E- 30). Almost all animals with a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> allele (37 out of 41) showed uniform apparent grey hair and almost all animals without a duplicated allele (117 out of 120) were completely black. Different forms of duplicated alleles were identified in Massese sheep including, in almost all cases, copies with exon 2 disrupting or partially inactivating mutations making these alleles different from the AWt allele. A few exceptions were observed in the association between ASIP polymorphisms and coat colour: three grey sheep did not carry any <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> allele and four black animals carried a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> allele. Of the latter four sheep, two carried the ED allele of the MC 1 R gene that may be the cause of their black coat colour. The coat colour of all other black animals may be determined by non-functional ASIP alleles (non-agouti alleles, Aa) and in a few cases by the ED Extension allele. At least three frequent ASIP haplotypes ([D 5 :g. 5172 T], [N:g. 5172 A] and [D 5 :g. 5172 A]) were detected (organized into six different diplotypes). In conclusion, the results indicated that coat colours in the Massese sheep breed are mainly derived by combining ASIP and MC 1 R mutations...|$|E

Both methods take advantage of established base sequence differences between Ren- 1 and Ren- 2 coding regions by using reverse transcriptase-mediated primer extension of oligonucleotide primer/mRNA hybrids {{in the presence of}} appropriate deoxy-and dideoxynucleotide phosphates.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{biosynthesis}} of aflatoxin (AF) involves over 20 {{enzymatic reactions}} {{in a complex}} polyketide pathway that converts acetate and malonate to the intermediates sterigmatocystin (ST) and O -methylsterigmatocystin (OMST), the respective penultimate and ultimate precursors of AF. Although these precursors are chemically and structurally very similar, their accumulation differs at the species level for Aspergilli. Notable examples are A. nidulans that synthesizes only ST, A. flavus that makes predominantly AF, and A. parasiticus that generally produces either AF or OMST. Whether these differences are important in the evolutionary/ecological processes of species adaptation and diversification is unknown. Equally unknown are the specific genomic mechanisms responsible for ordering and clustering of genes in the AF pathway of Aspergillus. Results To elucidate the mechanisms that have driven formation of these clusters, we performed systematic searches of aflatoxin cluster homologs across five Aspergillus genomes. We found {{a high level of}} gene duplication and identified seven modules consisting of highly correlated gene pairs (aflA/aflB, aflR/aflS, aflX/aflY, aflF/aflE, aflT/aflQ, aflC/aflW, and aflG/aflL). With the exception of A. nomius, contrasts of mean Ka/Ks values across all cluster genes showed significant differences in selective pressure between section Flavi and non-section Flavi species. A. nomius mean Ka/Ks values were more similar to partial clusters in A. fumigatus and A. terreus. Overall, mean Ka/Ks values were significantly higher for section Flavi than for non-section Flavi species. Conclusion Our results implicate several genomic mechanisms in the evolution of ST, OMST and AF cluster genes. Gene modules may arise from duplications of a single gene, whereby the function of the pre-duplication gene is retained in the copy (aflF / aflE) or the copies may partition the ancestral function (aflA/aflB). In some gene modules, the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> may simply augment/supplement a specific pathway function (aflR/aflS and aflX/aflY) or the <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> may evolve a completely new function (aflT/aflQ and aflC/aflW). Gene modules that are contiguous in one species and noncontiguous in others point to possible rearrangements of cluster genes in the evolution of these species. Significantly higher mean Ka/Ks values in section Flavi compared to non-section Flavi species indicate increased positive selection acting in the evolution of genes in OMST and AF gene clusters. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{homology}} between thyroglobulin and acetylcholinesterase (1) {{has been}} analyzed in detail. It contains 28. 3 % identical amino acids and extends over 544 residues, involving more than 90 % of the acetylcholinesterase molecule and the C-terminal portion of thyroglobulin. The hydropathy {{profiles of the}} homologous regions have been determined and compared. Their striking resemblance suggests that both proteins adopt a similar three dimensional structure and militates for some common property. As thyroglobulin and acetylcholinesterase are known to interact with cell membranes, we suggest that the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of thyroglobulin {{is involved in the}} binding. These observations demonstrate that thyroglobulin has evolved from the condensation of a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> of the acetylcholinesterase gene with an archaic thyroglobulin gene encoding the major hormonogenic domain.

40|$|Agouti {{signaling}} protein (ASIP) {{functions to}} regulate pigmentation in mice, while {{its role in}} many other animals and in humans has not been fully determined. In this study, we identify a 190 -kb tandem duplication encompassing the ovine ASIP and AHCY coding regions and the ITCH promoter region as the genetic cause of white coat color of dominant white/tan (AWt) agouti sheep. The duplication 5 ′ breakpoint is located upstream of the ASIP coding sequence. Ubiquitous expression of a second copy of the ASIP coding sequence regulated by a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> of the nearby ITCH promoter causes the white sheep phenotype. A single copy ASIP gene with a silenced ASIP promoter occurs in recessive black sheep.

The mutations inactivate the wild-type allele of cya- 8 (cytochrome aa 3 deficient, linkage group VII), resulting in thin, “transparent” mycelial growth. Other eas alleles fail to produce cya- 8 mutant progeny. The recurrent cya- 8 mutations are attributed to repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) resulting from a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> of cya- 8 + that was inserted ectopically at eas when the UCLA 191 mutation occurred. As expected for RIP, easUCLA-induced cya- 8 mutations occur during nuclear proliferation prior to karyogamy. When only one parent is easUCLA, the new mutations arise exclusively in easUCLA nuclei. Mutation of cya- 8 is suppressed when a long unlinked duplication is present. Stable cya- 8 mutations are effectively eliminated in crosses homozygous for rid, a recessive suppressor of RIP. The easUCLA allele {{is associated with a}} long paracentric inversion. A discontinuity is present in easUCLA DNA. The eas promoter is methylated in cya- 8 progeny of easUCLA, presumably by the spreading of methylation beyond the adjoining RIP-inactivated duplication. These findings support a model in which an ectopic insertion that created a mutation at the target site acts as a locus-specific mutator via RIP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many {{software}} security vulnerabilities only reveal themselves under certain conditions, i. e., particular configu-rations {{of the software}} together with its particular runtime environment. One approach to detecting these vulnerabilities is fuzz testing, which feeds a range of randomly modified inputs to a software application while monitoring it for failures. However, fuzz testing makes no guarantees regarding the syntactic and semantic validity of the input, or of {{how much of the}} input space will be explored. To address these problems, in this paper we present a new testing methodology called configuration fuzzing. Configuration fuzzing is a technique whereby the configuration of the running application is randomly modified at certain execution points, in order to check for vulnerabilities that only arise in certain conditions. As the application runs in the deployment environment, this testing technique continu-ously fuzzes the configuration and checks “security invariants” that, if violated, indicate a vulnerability; however, the fuzzing is performed in a <b>duplicated</b> <b>copy</b> of the original process, so that it does not affect the state of the running application. In addition to discussing the approach and describing a prototype framework for implementation, we also present the results of a case study to demonstrate the approach’s efficiency.

Repeats in F 8 intron 1 and intron 22 can recombine with homologous inverted repeats located about 200 kb upstream and 500 kb downstream of F 8, respectively, resulting in partial sequence inversion of the F 8 open reading frame and, subsequently, no functional protein production. Objectives:  In the present study, we characterize a third novel {{homologous recombination}} at Xq 28 consistent with absence of F 8 transcription that we previously reported for the affected chromosome of the index patient {{as well as his}} mother and sister.
