40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a <b>gastight</b> manner for chemical applications using a sealing compound based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all <b>gastight</b> at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC. This was achieved with high reproducibility by a composition in the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - CaO-K 2 O quaternary system. The ceramic sealing compound is selectively crystallized by adequate temperature control and shows then the required high temperature resistance. The strengths achieved are sufficient for the planned application as a sealing material for a ceramic microreactor. The temperature cycling resistance and the thermal shock resistance are also adapted to Al 2 O 3. Additional tests of commercial glass sealants were carried out to evaluate the results obtained.

40|$|Rotating disk {{electrodes}} (RDEs) {{are widely}} used in electrochemical characterization to analyze the mechanisms of various electrocatalytic reactions. RDE experiments often make use of or require collection and quantification of gaseous products. The combination of rotating parts and gaseous analytes makes the design of RDE cells that allow for headspace analysis challenging due to gas leaks at the interface of the cell body and the rotator. In this manuscript we describe a new, hermetically-sealed electrochemical cell that allows for electrode rotation while simultaneously providing a <b>gastight</b> environment. Electrode rotation in this new cell design is controlled by magnetically coupling the working electrode to a rotating magnetic driver. Calibration of the RDE using a tachometer shows that the rotation speed of the electrode {{is the same as}} that of the magnetic driver. To validate the performance of this cell for hydrodynamic measurements, limiting currents from the reduction of a potassium ferrocyanide (K_ 4 [Fe(CN) _ 6] • 3 H_ 2 O) were measured and shown to compare favorably with calculated values from the Levich equation and with data obtained using more typical, non-gastight RDE cells.

The variables considered in the systematic permeation study included the inlet gas flow rate of the sweep and air feed, the temperature {{and the nature of the}} oxygen feed gas (air or pure oxygen). Moreover, the influence of the deposition of a catalytic activation layer (17 mu m thick) made of BSCF on top of the thin <b>gastight</b> layer was investigated.

40|$|Thin oxygen-ion-conducting films (5 - 10 mu m) were {{prepared}} and characterized on mixed-conducting porous substrates. When {{this film is}} made of a pure ionic conductor, such as a gadolinia-doped ceria (Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 2 O 1. 9) electrolyte material, the assembly {{can be used as}} a cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for operation at intermediate temperatures (500 - 600 degrees C). In this case, a porous anode comprising a Ni-CGO cermet or a Pt coating is deposited on top of the highly conductive electrolyte. Another structure with promising applications is created when the supported <b>gastight</b> layer includes a mixed conductor such as ferrite or cobaltite perovskites acting as oxygen-permeable membrane, which can be applied in the combustion of fuel with pure oxygen or in the intensification of other industrial processes currently using aerial catalytic oxidation. The different supported films and multilayer assemblies were characterized by SEM, EDS-WDX, SIMS, helium, and oxygen permeation, showing that <b>gastight</b> thin films can be achieved (values > 1 x 10 (- 6) mbar L s(- 1) cm(- 2)) by inexpensive coating procedures (screen-printing or slip-casting). The electrochemical properties of thin CGO electrolytes were studied by impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and DC voltammetry on fully assembled fuel cells. It is concluded that thin CGO electrolytes under hydrogen atmosphere have enough n-type electronic conductivity to reduce the cell potential by 5 - 20 % from the Nernst potential, which causes the consequent power density decrease. A possible solution to these leakage currents is the use of a thin electron-blocking layer as stabilized zirconia (YSZ or SSZ) deposited on the fuel-exposed CGO electrolyte side.
