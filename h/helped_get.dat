5|$|The comics {{magazines}} {{showing up}} in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. Phil Seuling's California-based comics distributor Bud Plant was supportive of these underground and alternative comics, though, and <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> them into stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant {{and the emergence of}} specialty comic shops would form a distribution network for small press comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands.|$|E

5|$|The freeway bears several {{names in}} {{addition}} to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the Detroit–Toledo Expressway during planning in the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the Fisher Freeway or the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway, named for pioneers in the auto industry. Sections {{on either side of the}} Mackinac Bridge are the G. Mennen Williams Freeway or the Prentiss M. Brown Freeway, named for politicians who <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the American Legion Memorial Highway, after the organization of the same name. Various sections carry components of the four Great Lakes Circle Tours in the state.|$|E
5|$|In April, Benfica {{opened at}} home against Marítimo, with a squad {{composed}} mainly of reserve players. A 3–0 win <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> closer to both Braga and Sporting in the standings. On 13 April, Benfica visited Faro. The match ended in a 2–2 draw despite a Benfica having a first-half lead. Nine days later, Benfica played Vitória de Guimarães at home. A sole goal from Sabry in the 31st minute was enough to secure the team's second win in April. Closing out the month, Benfica travelled to Alvalade for the second Derby de Lisboa of the season. The game ended in a 3–0 loss for Benfica. This was the Lions' best result against Benfica since the 1986–87 season.|$|E
5|$|The first tournament of 2002 for Serevi was in Chile. Fiji {{advanced}} to the semi-finals where they faced New Zealand. During the match Serevi was tackled late by New Zealander Amasio Valence. Fijian player Marika Vunibaka ran 50 metres to punch Valence and a brawl then erupted – Fiji ended up losing the game. Serevi and Fiji rebounded the following week to win the tournament at Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. Serevi played in the Brisbane, Wellington, and then Beijing Sevens before returning to Hong Kong. In Fiji's defeat of Australia in their quarter-final, Serevi scored 13 points to take his Hong Kong points tally over 1000. Fiji defeated New Zealand in their semi-final and faced England in the final. England defeated Fiji 33–20 in the final. Later that year Serevi captained Fiji to the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. He <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> the team to the games' final with a try-saving tackle during Fiji's 17–7 defeat of South Africa in their semi-final. The final was against New Zealand, and despite Serevi landing a penalty to give Fiji a 15–14 lead with two minutes left, New Zealand won 33–17.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is {{at the bottom of a}} basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.|$|E

25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make people {{leave in the}} morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There are some daytime shelters where people could go, instead of being stranded on the streets, and they could be <b>helped,</b> <b>get</b> counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.|$|E

In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought {{to make the best of}} it. The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> it done.

25|$|Giuliani met local {{television}} personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, {{and they began}} dating when she was working in Miami. Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982. The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued {{by the end of}} 1982, while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the Giuliani-Peruggi marriage was granted at the end of 1983 reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins. Giuliani biographer Wayne Barrett reports that Peruggi's brother believes that Giuliani knew {{at the time of the}} marriage that they were second cousins. Alan Placa, Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> the annulment. Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} the close ties was {{revealed}} in 1971; {{a conflict of interest}} case of alderman Ben Grys, who chaired the Buildings and Development Committee. His wife Gladys, bought properties in the High Park area, then resold them to a developer. Grys then <b>helped</b> <b>get</b> rezoning for the area to allow developers {{to increase the number of}} units they could build, without disclosing his interest. Alderman John Sewell learned of the Grys purchases through a resident of the area. Grys launched a lawsuit against Sewell but it was dropped. Grys was defeated in 1972, the same election that Reformer David Crombie was elected mayor. Crombie was mayor until 1978 and during his term, the city enacted a holding by-law to curb the development industry. In 1978, Crombie was succeeded by Sewell as mayor.|$|E
