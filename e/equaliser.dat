5|$|He scored an {{important}} <b>equaliser</b> against Wigan Athletic {{in the play}} off semi final first leg (which was also the last ever goal to be scored at Springfield Park). The sixteenth goal was particularly crucial, a 15-yard, top corner injury time <b>equaliser</b> in {{the final of the}} promotion playoffs against Gillingham. Dickov's 95th-minute goal took the game to extra time, and the Manchester team ultimately won to earn promotion to the First Division. This goal, scored past Vince Bartram, the best man at Dickov's wedding, was voted City's Greatest Ever Goal in a 2005 poll conducted by Manchester City.|$|E

40|$|Channel {{equalisation}} is {{a process}} of compensating the disruptive effects caused mainly by Inter Symbol Interference in a band-limited channel and plays a vital role for enabling higher data rate in digital communication. The development of new training algorithms, structures and the selection of the design parameters for <b>equalisers</b> are active fields of research which are exploiting the benefits of different signal processing techniques. Designing efficient <b>equalisers</b> based on low structural complexity, is also an area of much interest keeping in view of real-time implementation issue. However, it has been widely reported that optimal performance can only be realised using nonlinear <b>equalisers.</b> As Artificial Neural Networks are inherently nonlinear processing elements and possess capabilities of universal approximation and pattern classification, these are well suited for developing high performance adaptive <b>equalisers.</b> This proposed work has significantly contributed to the d [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive Wireless Transceivers {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a broad overview of near-instantaneously adaptive transceivers {{in the context of}} TDMA, CDMA and OFDM systems. The adaptive transceivers examined employ powerful turbo codecs, turbo <b>equalisers</b> and space-time codecs, equipping the reader with a future-proof technological road map. It demonstrates that adaptive transceivers are capable of mitigating the channel quality fluctuations of the wireless channel as a lower-complexity alternative to space-time coding. By contrast, if the higher complexity of multiple transmitters and multiple receiver-assisted systems is deemed acceptable, the advantages of adaptability erode. • Provides an in-depth introduction to channel <b>equalisers</b> and Kalman filtering and discusses the associated complexity versus performance trade-offs • Introduces wideband near-instantaneously adaptive transceivers and studies their performance both with and without turbo channel coding • Describes how to optimise adaptive modulation mode switching and highlights a range of practical considerations • Introduces neural network based channel <b>equalisers</b> and discusses Radial Basis Function (RBF) assisted <b>equalisers</b> embedded into adaptive modems supported by turbo channel coding and turbo channel equalisation • Employs the above adaptive principles also in the context of CDMA and OFDM transceivers and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} space-time coding versus adaptive modulation Researchers, advanced students and practising development engineers working in wireless communications will all find this valuable text an informative read...|$|R
