25|$|In {{addition}} to being a period of wealth and economic growth, the late Ming dynasty also brought intellectual fervor and liberalization.

Scholars of the Donglin school protested increases in <b>government</b> <b>taxation</b> during the Wanli Emperor, and restrictions on freedom of speech, advocating a program similar to classical liberalism.|$|E

25|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, {{opposition}} to Thatcher's policies on local <b>government</b> <b>taxation,</b> her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (especially high interest rates of 15%, which were undermining her core voting base within the home-owning, entrepreneurial and business sectors), and the divisions opening within her party over the appropriate handling of European integration made her and her party seem increasingly politically vulnerable. Her increasingly combative, irritable personality also made opposition to her grow fast and by this point, even many in her own party could not stand her.|$|E
25|$|In economics, the Laffer curve {{illustrates}} a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation {{and the resulting}} levels of government revenue. It illustrates the concept of taxable income elasticity—i.e.,taxable income changes in response {{to changes in the}} rate of taxation. The Laffer curve assumes that no tax revenue is raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%, {{and that there is a}} rate between 0% and 100% that maximizes <b>government</b> <b>taxation</b> revenue. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph that starts at 0% tax with zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue at an intermediate rate of taxation, and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate. However, the shape of the curve is uncertain and disputed among economists.|$|E
500|$|The {{municipal}} government of Hangzhou enacted {{policies and programs}} that aided in {{the maintenance of the}} city and ensured the well-being of its inhabitants. In order to maintain order in such a large city, four or five guards were quartered in the city at intervals of about [...] Their main duties were to prevent brawls and thievery, patrol the streets at night, and quickly warn the public when fires broke out. The government assigned 2,000 soldiers to 14 fire stations built to combat the spread of fire within the city, and stationed 1,200 soldiers in fire stations outside the city's ramparts. [...] These stations were placed [...] apart, with watchtowers that were permanently manned by 100 men each. Like earlier cities, the Song capitals featured wide, open avenues to create fire breaks. However, widespread fires remained a constant threat. When a fire broke out in 1137, the government suspended the requirement of rent payments, alms of 108,840kg (120tons) of rice were distributed to the poor, and items such as bamboo, planks, and rush-matting were exempt from <b>government</b> <b>taxation.</b> Fires were not the only problem facing the residents of Hangzhou and other crowded cities. Far more than in the rural countryside, poverty was widespread and became a major topic of debate at the central court and in local governments. To mitigate its effects, the Song government enacted many initiatives, including the distribution of alms to the poor; the establishment of public clinics, pharmacies, and retirement homes; and the creation of paupers' graveyards. In fact, each administrative prefecture had public hospitals managed by the state, where the poor, aged, sick, and incurable could be cared for, free of charge.|$|E

Reagan continued to downsize <b>government</b> <b>taxation</b> and regulation. The U.S. experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984, and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.2%.|$|E
2500|$|Entertainers and courtiers {{were often}} dependents upon the wealthy or were {{associated}} with the often-perceived immoral pleasure grounds of urban entertainment districts. To give them official recognition would have given them more prestige. Although shamans and diviners in Bronze Age China had some authority as religious leaders in society, the scholars did not want religious leaders amassing too much power and influence like military strongmen (one example of this would be Zhang Jiao, who led a Taoist sect into open rebellion against the Han government's authority). There were also multiple persecutions of Buddhism in China, a lot of the contention being over Buddhist monasteries' exemption from <b>government</b> <b>taxation,</b> but also because later Neo-Confucian scholars saw Buddhism as an alien ideology and threat to the moral order of society.|$|E
