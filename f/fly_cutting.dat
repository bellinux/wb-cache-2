40|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>cutting</b> in ultra-precision {{machining}} (UPM), termed ultra-precision <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> (UPFC), is an {{intermittent cutting}} {{process in which}} a diamond tool is mounted with a spindle to intermittently cut a workpiece. The process offers the high flexibility necessary for fabricating freeform, micro/nano-structural surfaces, as well as hybrid structural surfaces with sub-micrometric form error and nanometric surface roughness, and its constant cutting velocity provides uniform high surface quality. However, {{in addition to its}} low machining efficiency, UPFC's intermittent cutting process results in distinctive surface generation mechanisms, covering intermittent tool-workpiece relative motion, tool geometry imprinted into a machined surface, and surface material separation and deformation. General factors, such as cutting conditions, tool geometry, material factors (material property change, material swelling and recovery, and material separation mechanism), kinematic and dynamic errors, assembling errors, cutting strategies, tool path, and workpiece geometry, are individual to UPFC and universal in UPM. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the current investigation of <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> applied into surface generation in UPM. Conclusions are reached and the challenges and opportunities for further studies are discussed. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThermal {{deviations}} in {{gear hobbing}} {{are one of}} the main reasons for wet machining. To reduce lubricant, especially for dry machin- ing of large modulus, it is necessary to compensate these thermal deviations. Gear hobbing is a very complex technology, where chip geometries are changing continuously. To measure cutting forces during machining a simplified <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> test is commonly used. Within this study a modification of the <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> test was necessary to enable the measurement of temperature and temperature distribution in the gear during the process. For a better understanding, in addition numerical simulations are performed to calculate the heat flow and thermal distribution. Thereby, a two step simulation procedure was applied. The generated heat during chip formation was evaluated in the first step. The second step is a heat flow simulation, where the generated heat from the first step was used. In this simulation part, the heat flow and thermal deviations are calculated, and also chip removal is taken into account. Thereby, different simulation strategies are used to reduce the calculation time, which will be described within this paper. The results are showing a good agreement between the measured and calculated temperature fields in chip formation and heat flow...|$|E
40|$|In ultra-precision raster <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> (UPRFC), {{very high}} {{frequency}} microwaves {{in the range of}} 3. 42 MHz- 6. 36 MHz are found on the machined surface. This study conducted a series of theoretical and experimental investigations to discover the origin of these microwaves and how they might be suppressed. Research results show that: (i) microwaves on the machined surface are caused by the material sliding during the chip formation in UPRFC; (ii) owing to the inconsistent thickness of chips along their length direction, the microwaves accumulate at the surface-exit in each feed length; and (iii) chip thickness and tool wear change the length and distribution of the microwaves. This research provides a deep insight into the formation of microwaves along with suggestion on how to suppress them. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{inherent}} residual tool marks (RTM) {{with particular}} patterns highly affect optical {{functions of the}} generated freeform optics in fast tool servo or slow tool servo (FTS/STS) diamond turning. In the present study, a novel biaxial servo assisted <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> (BSFC) method is developed for flexible control of the RTM to be a functional micro/nanotexture in freeform optics generation, which is generally hard to achieve in FTS/STS diamond turning. In the BSFC system, biaxial servo motions along the z-axis and side-feeding directions are mainly adopted for primary surface generation and RTM control, respectively. Active control of the RTM from the two aspects, namely, undesired effect elimination or effective functionalization, are experimentally demonstrated by fabricating a typical F-theta freeform surface with scattering homogenization and two functional microstructures with imposition of secondary phase gratings integrating both reflective and diffractive functions.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{the concepts of}} fast/slow tool servo and <b>fly</b> <b>cutting,</b> a novel end-fly-cutting-servo (EFCS) system with four-axis motions is proposed for deterministic generation of hierarchical micro-nanostructures, which are conventionally difficult for both mechanical and non-mechanical methods to achieve. In the EFCS system, an intricately shaped primary surface is generated by material removal, while the desired secondary nanostructure is simultaneously constructed using residual tool marks by actively controlling the tool loci. The optimal toolpath determination strategy, as well as surface generation algorithm for the EFCS system, has been developed with consideration of geometries and installation poses of the diamond tool. Numerical simulation of surface generation is conducted to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} novel machining method and features of the obtained hierarchical structures. A nanostructured micro-aspheric array and a nanostructured F-theta freeform surface are successfully fabricated in experiments. This research provides a very promising technique for the generation of hierarchical micro-nanostructures to realize performance integration of artificial components.

40|$|Ultra-precision <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> (UPFC) is an {{intermittent}} cutting process, which {{is widely used}} in the fabrication of non-rotational symmetric micro structures with sub-micron form accuracy and nanometric surface roughness. In UPFC, the occurrence of tool wear certainly affects the accuracy of machined micro structures. Aimed at the close relations between tool wear and chip morphologies and the truth that cutting chips are fully formed in a cutting cycle, this research developed a tool wear evaluation approach based on cutting chips. Chip morphology features related to tool failure patterns were identified and then parameterized to predict the tool failure patterns, the surface topography, and surface roughness under the effects of tool failure patterns. Predictions were then verified by experimental results. Research results show that chip morphologies were successfully used to present tool failure pattern, following the well-designed identification procedures, the tool failure patterns are accurately identified. This approach is practical since it can in-process identify tool failure patterns and their effects on surface quality. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These <b>flies</b> have complex <b>cutting</b> mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of Glossina genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision <b>fly</b> <b>cutting</b> (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, wear land formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting chips and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of wear land on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer. Findings from the research provide rich insight into the relationships of tool wear characteristics to cutting forces, chip formation, and machined surface quality in intermittent cutting processes.
