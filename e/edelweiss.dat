25|$|Lanz {{continued}} {{to command the}} division during its advance in the Soviet Union, participating in the breakthrough of the Stalin Line and the advance to the Dnjepr and the Mius River. In May 1942, Lanz's division fought in the Second Battle of Kharkov and then participated in the Fall Blau offensive through southern Russia and into the Caucasus (Operation <b>Edelweiss).</b> In a symbolic propaganda move, on 21 August, Lanz sent a detachment of his men to raise the German flag on Mount Elbrus. Although the feat was widely publicized by Goebbels, Hitler was furious at this.|$|E

25|$|These {{experiments}} mostly {{use either}} cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as germanium. Noble liquid detectors detect scintillation {{produced by a}} particle collision in liquid xenon or argon. Cryogenic detector experiments include: CDMS, CRESST, <b>EDELWEISS,</b> EURECA. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, XENON, DEAP, ArDM, WARP, DarkSide, PandaX, and LUX, the Large Underground Xenon experiment. Both of these techniques focus strongly {{on their ability to}} distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include SIMPLE and PICASSO.|$|E
25|$|The entire lake {{lies in the}} Tara National Park, one of five in Serbia. The lake is {{surrounded}} by vast woods as forestation of Tara mountain is 75%. Zaovine is the area where Josif Pančić, a leading Serbian botanist, discovered the endemic Serbian spruce in 1875 on the nearby Kik hill. The hill was destroyed in the early 1980s and material was used for building the dam that created Zaovine Lake. There are over 600 plant species in the area surrounding the lake, of which 15 are protected by law, including the Serbian spurce and <b>edelweiss.</b> Wildlife include chamois and 14 species of fish living in the lake, including nase, rainbow trout, European chub and Danube Roach.|$|E
25|$|The {{splitting}} of Army Group South {{enabled the}} launching of Operation <b>Edelweiss</b> and Operation Fischreiher, the two main thrusts of the Army Groups. Both groups had to achieve their objectives simultaneously, instead of consecutively. The success of the initial advance was such that Hitler ordered the Fourth Panzer Army south to assist the First Panzer Army to cross the lower Don river. This assistance was not needed and Kleist later complained that Fourth Panzer Army clogged the roads and {{that if they had}} carried on toward Stalingrad, they could have taken it in July. When it turned north again two weeks later, the Soviets had gathered enough forces together at Stalingrad to check its advance.|$|E
25|$|When Imperial forces {{launch an}} attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of the country's hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life {{alongside}} the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the <b>Edelweiss,</b> they escape to the capital city of Randgriz and join the Gallian militia. Welkin is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and assumes command of the newly formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Members of the squad initially question Welkin's qualifications {{due to a lack of}} combat experience. He quickly gains their trust and loyalty, however, with his brilliant tactics. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged, but tragically, Isara is killed by an Imperial sniper.|$|E
500|$|The {{area around}} Stampesletta, {{which is located}} along the creek Mesnaelva, and means [...] "the plain beside a mill". The area, which {{traditionally}} had been called Myra, was originally part of the farm Lysgård, with Stampesletta being its own croft. The area was bought by Lillehammer Municipality in 1933. The hillside further up, at Kanthaugen and Lysgård, featured ski activities {{from the turn of}} the 20th century. Plans to use one of the few flat places in Lillehammer for sports was launched by the municipal planning office in 1941. However, the German occupation of Norway caused an interruption in the plans, and a prisoner-of-war camp for Russians, Lager <b>Edelweiss,</b> was located there instead.|$|E

Its baptism of fire was an attack on the Russians on 26 August 1914, during which it received inadequate artillery support and suffered heavy casualties. One of those wounded was Mikl, who was shot in the chest. He spent time in a military hospital and was then employed in the regimental replacement battalion as an instructor until 15 April 1915. Nothing is known about Mikl's activities during that period, although LIR 4 was involved in heavy fighting in Galicia throughout the winter, in temperatures that dropped below [...]|$|E
500|$|A strict {{system of}} inspection, started in Austria, has evolved {{to ensure that}} only good quality stock meeting high {{standards}} is used for breeding. This is coupled with close maintenance of the studbook to maintain inspection validity. Mares must be inspected and registered with the stud book {{before they can be}} covered, and multiple forms are needed to prove covering and birth of a purebred Haflinger foal. Within six months of birth, foals are inspected, and those considered to have potential as breeding stock are given certificates of pedigree and branded. Horses are reinspected at three years old, checked against written association standards, and if they pass, are then entered into the studbook. After their final inspection Haflingers from Austria and Italy are branded with a firebrand in the shape of an <b>edelweiss.</b> Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter [...] "H" [...] {{in the center of the}} brand, while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters [...] "HI". Horses are graded based on conformation, action, bone, height, temperament and color. Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud book acceptance. Stallions are registered separately. Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree, and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength as well as the other qualifications. Each stallion's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations, as well as records of mares covered, percentages of pregnancies aborted, still-born and live-born, and numbers and genders of foals born. This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding. Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment, and those not chosen must be either gelded or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area. The chosen colts are reassessed every six months until a final inspection at the age of three, when the best stallions are chosen for Tyrolean breeding, after which they are purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture and made available for breeding throughout the region. The others are either gelded or sold out of the region. Other countries base their registration and selection practices on Tyrolean ones, as is required by the WHF.|$|E

2500|$|The {{vegetation}} of Pirin is vertically {{divided into}} five distinct elevation zones: Mediterranean, deciduous, coniferous, that combined form {{the tree line}} reaching approximately altitude of 2,000m, shrubs forming the subalpine line up to 2,500m and alpine meadows, {{also known as the}} alpine line above 2,500m. The Mediterranean zone is dominated, among other, by pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), the deciduous zone by European oak (Quercus robur) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and the coniferous— by Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The subalpine line is mainly covered with dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen and abundant in bilberries and rare flowers such as the <b>edelweiss</b> (Leontopodium alpinum). Pirin is home to Bulgaria's oldest tree, the 1300–year Baikushev's pine— a Bosnian pine that is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD.|$|E
2500|$|Stanislav Govorukhin and Boris Durov's The Vertical (1967), a {{mountain}} climbing drama, starring Vysotsky (as Volodya the radioman), brought him all-round recognition and fame. Four {{of the numbers}} used in the film (including [...] "Song of a Friend" [...] (Песня о друге), released in 1968 by the Soviet recording industry monopolist Melodiya disc to become an unofficial hit) were written literally on the spot, nearby Elbrus, inspired by professional climbers' tales and one curious hotel bar conversation with a German guest who 25 years ago happened to climb these very mountains in a capacity of an <b>Edelweiss</b> division fighter. Another 1967 film, Kira Muratova's Brief Encounters featured Vysotsky as the geologist Maxim (paste-bearded again) with a now trademark off-the-cuff musical piece, a melancholy improvisation called [...] "Things to Do" [...] (Дела). All the while Vysotsky continued working hard at Taganka, with another important role under his belt (that of Mayakovsky or, rather one the latter's character five different versions) in the experimental piece called Listen!
