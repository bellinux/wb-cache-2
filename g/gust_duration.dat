40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the appropriate duration for basic gust wind speeds in wind loading codes and standards, and in wind engineering generally. Although various proposed definitions are discussed, the 'moving average' <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> {{has been widely}} accepted internationally. The commonly-specified <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> of 3 -seconds, however, is shown {{to have a significant}} effect on the high-frequency end of the spectrum of turbulence, and may not be ideally suited for wind engineering purposes. The effective gust durations measured by commonly-used anemometer types are discussed; these are typically considerably shorter than the 'standard' duration of 3 seconds. Using stationary random process theory, the paper gives expected peak factors, g w, as a function of the non-dimensional parameter (T/τ), where T is the sample, or reference, time, and τ is the <b>gust</b> <b>duration,</b> and a non-dimensional mean wind speed, U. T/L w, where U is a mean wind speed, and L w is the integral length scale of turbulence. The commonly-used Durst relationship, relating gusts of various durations, is shown to correspond to a particular value of turbulence intensity I u, of 16. 5 %, and is therefore applicable to particular terrain and height situations, and hence should not be applied universally. The effective frontal areas associated with peak gusts of various durations are discussed; this indicates that a gust of 3 seconds has an equivalent frontal area equal to that of a tall building. Finally a generalized gust response factor format, accounting for fluctuating and resonant along-wind loading of structures, applicable to any code is presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the TNO gust {{analysis}} method {{and the resulting}} TNO gust model are described. The method {{has been applied to}} a set of 700 hours of stationary wind speed time series measured at the meteorological mast at Cabauw, The Netherlands. The results are discussed in this paper. The TNO gust model has been developed for the calculation of wind turbine loads, especially fatigue loads. To model gusts an analysis method has been developed to statistically analyze full-scale wind speed data and translate these to discrete gusts. The main result of the TNO gust model is that finally, all gust amplitudes are described by one single expression being a function of the height, the mean wind speed, the turbulence intensity, the <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> and the probability exceedance level within an error band of less than 5 %. The model also gives a relation between the <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> and the frequency of occurence of the gusts. The TNO gust model has been incorporated in the Dutch Handbook 'Wind Data for Wind Turbine Design'. Verification of this handbook has been performed by comparing the flap and lag loads on the blade root of three different wind turbines by means of the Handbook with the loads measured. The comparison showed very good agreement especially in the range 10 2 to 10 8 load fluctuations per year. © 1992...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for scaling Doppler lidar observations of wind gusts {{to make them}} comparable with those observed at a meteorological mast. Doppler lidars can then be used to measure wind gusts in regions and heights where traditional meteorological mast measurements are not available. This novel method also provides estimates for wind gusts at arbitrary <b>gust</b> <b>durations,</b> including those shorter than the temporal resolution of the Doppler lidar measurements. The input parameters for the scaling method are the measured wind-gust speed {{as well as the}} mean and standard deviation of the horizontal wind speed. The method was tested using WindCube V 2 Doppler lidar measurements taken next to a 100 m high meteorological mast. It is shown that the method can provide realistic Doppler lidar estimates of the gust factor, i. e. the ratio of the wind-gust speed to the mean wind speed. The method reduced the bias in the Doppler lidar gust factors from 0. 07 to 0. 03 and can be improved further to reduce the bias by using a realistic estimate of turbulence. Wind gust measurements are often prone to outliers in the time series, because they represent the maximum of a (moving-averaged) horizontal wind speed. To assure the data quality in this study, we applied a filtering technique based on spike detection to remove possible outliers in the Doppler lidar data. We found that the spike detection-removal method clearly improved the wind-gust measurements, both with and without the scaling method. Spike detection also outperformed the traditional Doppler lidar quality assurance method based on carrier-to-noise ratio, by removing additional unrealistic outliers present in the time serie...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{initiation}} of motion of an object lying on a horizontal floor due to the aerodynamic force produced by a time-dependent wind is considered. It is assumed in this paper that when the aerodynamic force is large enough, the body starts to rotate around the most rearward supporting contact point, or pivoting point. This motion is analyzed by studying {{the dynamics of the}} rotation of the body around a pivoting point fixed to the floor, and placed in a gravity field under time-dependent aerodynamic loads produced by a non-steady incoming flow. This rotation initiation phase, which is relevant {{in the case of a}} time-varying gusty flow, is an intermediate phase between the two stages generally considered, namely, the initial static equilibrium without motion, and the final flight. In this intermediate phase, which is studied here, the rotational dynamics of the body should be taken into account and the gust characteristics as well, in order to determine whether once initiated the motion it leads to either a frustrated motion or to a successful one. A non-linear mathematical model has been developed, and a linear approximation is deduced, which allows us to obtain the condition for a successful flight. This condition shows two limits, valid for either long or short <b>duration</b> <b>gusts,</b> respectively. Some experiments have been performed in a gust wind tunnel, and results show a satisfactory agreement. To take into account the intrinsic random character of the phenomena in practical situations, expressions for the probability of exceeding the condition for successful flight under short <b>duration</b> <b>gusts</b> are obtained, assuming common probability density functions for the random parameters involved...|$|R
40|$|Besides peak gust speeds, a <b>gust</b> {{factor and}} <b>duration</b> of strong wind affects extent of {{structural}} damage. Typhoon Mireille (No. 19 in 1991) had features of high gust factors {{and a high}} moving speed. On the other hand, a movement speed of Typhoon Talas (No. 12 in 2011) was very slow. In this paper, relations between moving speeds of six typhoons which caused damage after 19902 ̆ 7 s and characteristics of strong winds were compared. The following features were found: (1) ・Although a relation between moving speed of typhoons and wind speeds varied widely, 2 ̆ 2 typhoon gust factor 2 ̆ 2, which is a ratio of peak gust speed and maximum wind speed resulting from typhoons, seems to increase as moving speeds of typhoons become high. (2) Wind speeds and gust factors recorded at points {{on the right side}} of a typhoon path become larger than those on the left side...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} micro-scale {{model is}} used to study some aspects of wind comfort in a built-up area. The equations for calculating the mean wind have been extended by a Markov approach for short-term wind fluctuations. The model components have been successfully verified against wind tunnel measurements and observations of a field experiment. The simulated time series are used to estimate wind comfort measures. It {{turns out that the}} frequency of exceedance of prescribed thresholds depends strongly on the specification of the <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> time. It was also possible to calculate the spatial distribution of a gust factor g depending on local wind characteristics. The simulated range is much broader than a value of g = 3 - 3. 5 commonly used for wind comfort assessments. Again, the order of magnitude and the bandwidth of g depends strongly on the definition of a gust. DF...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{velocity}} {{data are}} often analysed to determine gust (peak) and mean (average) statistics for design to sustain in extreme conditions and for control to monitor these extreme levels through continuous {{measurement of the}} related means {{over a period of}} time. The relationship between the gust and the mean is simply expressed as the ratio of the gust to mean wind speeds, termed as the Gust Factor, G. The shorter the averaging period for the mean, the closer of the measured mean to the gust wind speed this becomes. The gust maximum value itself would also be higher when averaged over a shorter <b>gust</b> <b>duration,</b> t, or measured with higher turbulence intensity Iu or higher longitudinal length scale Lux. Therefore, it is important in the description of a Gust Factor to qualify the averaging duration both for gust and for mean wind speeds as well as the turbulence characteristics in the wind flow. This paper presents an analysis of wind tunnel data to relate the gust wind speed measurements and hence the Gust Factors for various averaging durations in neutral wind flow conditions of various turbulence intensities and longitudinal length scales. Some full scale wind data are also compared. The proposed relationship with respect to the hourly mean wind speed is as follows: G = 1 + 0. 075 • Iu • Lux 0. 25 • [ln(t/ 3600) ] 2 • [0. 3 + 0. 02 ln(t/ 3600) ...|$|E
40|$|Crosswind {{stability}} of rail vehicles {{has been a}} research area for several decades,mainly motivated by vehicle overturning accidents and higher speeds, but in recenttimes also by issues of lower energy consumption and track maintenance costsdemanding lower vehicle weights. During everyday operation, rail vehicles are subjectedto large lateral influences from track irregularities, track curves and crosswind,leading to large suspension deflections and increased crosswind sensitivity. Also unsteady crosswind like gusts calls for attention. Simulations of possible vehicleoverturning are necessary, but need to take large deflections and high shear inthe suspension into account. If delivering reasonable results, simulations representan important tool for overturning prediction of the vehicle. In the present work, multibody simulations of a high-speed vehicle at large lateralinfluences from track curves and track irregularities have been carried out, using ahalf-vehicle model in 2 D and {{a model of a}} whole vehicle in 3 D. The vehicle modelsalso include different suspension models. Corresponding field measurements ofthe relative lateral and vertical deflections in the secondary suspension have beenperformed on a fast train and used for validation of the multibody simulations,resulting in good agreement between measurements and simulations. The 3 D vehicle model was further used to study the vehicle response to unsteadycrosswind during curve negotiation where aerodynamic loads obtained by unsteadyComputational Fluid Dynamics, namely Detached Eddy Simulations, representingthree types of gusts were used. In addition, the method of Quasi Transient GustModelling was evaluated in terms of overturning risk. Strong lateral and roll responsesof the vehicle and influences of the <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> and the relative differencebetween mean and maximum wind speed were observed. Further, variations of suspensionand mass properties of the vehicle were performed to study the influenceon crosswind sensitivity. The position of the centre of mass of the carbody and thelateral bumpstop clearance showed significant influence on the crosswind stability...|$|E
40|$|There {{is as yet}} no {{standard}} {{methodology for}} measuring wind gusts from a moving platform. To address this, we have developed a method to derive gusts from research aircraft data. First we evaluated four different approaches, including Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen turbulence, to derive the gust length scales that correspond to the gust time scales, namely, the <b>gust</b> <b>duration</b> (seconds) and the sample period (typically 10 min). The novelty of our method is in using peak factors (deviation of the gust from the mean wind speed normalized by the local turbulence) to convert between the scales. After devising a way to derive the gust length scales, we calculated the gust factors from aircraft observations and tested them against those from four parameterizations originally developed for weather stations. Three of them performed well (R 2 = 0. 66 or higher), while the fourth overestimated the gust factors in unstable conditions(R 2 = 0. 52). The mean errors for all methods were low, from - 0. 02 to 0. 05, indicating that wind gust factors can indeed be measured from research aircraft. Moreover, we showed that aircraft can provide gust measurements within the whole boundary layer, if horizontal legs are flown at multiple levels over the same track. This is a significant advance, as gust measurements are usually limited to heights reached by weather masts. In unstable conditions over the open ocean the gust factor was nearly constant with height throughout the boundary layer, the near-surface values only slightly exceeding those at upper levels. Furthermore, we found gust factors to be strongly dependent on surface roughness conditions, which differed between the open ocean and sea ice in the Arctic marine environment. The roughness effect on the gust factor was stronger than the effect of boundary-layer stability...|$|E
