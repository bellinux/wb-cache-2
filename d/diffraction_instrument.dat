40|$|From {{the late}} 1960 s until now, lunar soil {{particle}} size distributions have typically been determined by sieving sometimes dry, {{and at other}} times with fluids such as water or Freon. Laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>instruments</b> allow rapid assessment of particle size distribution, and eventually may replace sieve measurements. However, when measuring lunar soils with laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>instruments,</b> care must be taken in choosing a carrier fluid that is compatible with lunar material. Distilled water is the fluid of choice for laser diffraction measurements of substances when there is no concern about adverse effects of water on the material being measured. When we began our analyses of lunar soils using laser diffraction, our first measurements were made with distilled water. Although the medians that we measured were comparable to earlier sieve data, the means tended to be significantly larger than expected. The effect of water vapor on lunar soil has been studied extensively. The particles interact strongly with water vapor, and subsequent adsorptions of nitrogen showed that the specific surface area increased as much as threefold after exposure to moisture. It was observed that significant porosity had been generated by this exposure to water vapor. The possibility of other physical changes in the surfaces of the grains was not studied...|$|R

50|$|Texture can be {{determined}} by various methods. Some methods allow a quantitative analysis of the texture, while others are only qualitative. Among the quantitative techniques, {{the most widely used}} is X-ray diffraction using texture goniometers, followed by the EBSD method (electron backscatter diffraction) in Scanning Electron Microscopes. Qualitative analysis can be done by Laue photography, simple X-ray diffraction or with a polarized microscope. Neutron and synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction are suitable for determining textures of bulk materials and in situ analysis, whereas laboratory x-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>instruments</b> are more appropriate for analyzing textures of thin films.|$|R

The single arm, together with the polarizer and analyser and possible rotators, are mounted {{in front of the}} sample. The great advantage with respect to the case with another precession arm in the reflected beam is that magnetic samples can now be investigated, because depolarization and the Larmor phase change of the beam polarization in the sample after the analyser is no longer of importance for diffraction analysis.

Neutron diffraction makes a contrasting almost isoelectronic atomic species possible, {{as well as a}} separation of elastic and inelastic diffuse intensity contributions. Experimental work at high temperatures is comparatively unproblematic. The method suffers, however, from the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently sized mono-grain samples and a lack of dedicated neutron <b>diffraction</b> <b>instruments.</b> Recent results, with a main focus on high-temperature (< 1000 °C) investigations of disordered decagonal Al-Ni-Co phases are reported and some tentative models are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of qualitative measuring {{techniques such as}} imaging, with quantitative drop sizing techniques like Laser Diffraction and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA), has been applied for assessing the sprays formed by injectors for gasoline direct injection (DI) engines. Both, the sizing instruments {{as well as the}} imaging, are offering temporal resolution in order to investigate the important features of pulsed DI sprays. Using a {{combination of}} the spatially integrating Laser <b>Diffraction</b> <b>instrument</b> with strobe illuminated dual view 2 D-imaging, the overall spray properties have been assessed. Having the 2 D information of the global spray shape in two perpendicular directions allows to immediately correlate the concentration and drop size measurement results of the Laser <b>Diffraction</b> <b>instrument</b> with the global spray appearance. Thus, the changes of the spray pattern can be related with the sizing information as the spray propagates away from the injector. For injector design improvements, however, it is required to achieve a higher spatial resolution and especially to measure closer to the injector exit orifice than the Laser Diffraction allows. By using a Phase Doppler Anemometer, the different phases of the injection event, i. e. opening of the injector, main spray and closing phase of the injector, can be distinguished from each other. However, in sprays, where the spray geometry is changing with time, the Phas...|$|E
