40|$|International audienceThe {{neutral theory}} of {{biodiversity}} assumes that coexisting organisms are equally able to survive, reproduce, and disperse (<b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence),</b> but predicts that stochastic fluctuations of these abilities drive diversity dynamics. It predicts remarkably well many biodiversity patterns, although substantial {{evidence for the}} role of niche variation across organisms seems contradictory. Here, we discuss this apparent paradox by exploring the meaning and implications of <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence.</b> We address the question whether neutral theory provides an explanation for biodiversity patterns and acknowledges causal processes. We underline that <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence,</b> although central to neutral theory, can emerge at local and regional scales from niche-based processes through equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms. Such emerging equivalence corresponds to a weak conception of neutral theory, as opposed to the assumption of strict equivalence at the individual level in strong conception. We show that this duality is related to diverging views on hypothesis testing and modeling in ecology. In addition, the stochastic dynamics exposed in neutral theory are pervasive in ecological systems and, rather than a null hypothesis, <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> is best understood as a parsimonious baseline to address biodiversity dynamics at multiple scales...|$|E
40|$|Neutral theory {{consists}} of a suite of models that assume <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> among individual organisms. They have been most commonly applied to tropical forest tree communities either as null models or as approximations. Neutral models typically only include reproductive adults; therefore, fitting to empirical tree community data requires defining a reproductive-size threshold, which for trees is usually set arbitrarily to a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 100 mm. The inevitable exclusion of some reproductive adults and inclusion of some saplings cause a non-random sampling bias in neutral model fits. Here, we investigate this problem and resolve it by introducing simple age structure into a neutral model...|$|E

40|$|The {{tropical}} oligotrophic oceanic {{areas are}} characterized by high water transparency and annual solar radiation. Under these conditions, {{a large number of}} phylogenetically diverse mesozooplankton species living in the surface waters (neuston) are found to be blue pigmented. In the present study, we focused on understanding the metabolic and genetic basis of the observed blue phenotype functional equivalence between the blue-pigmented organisms from the phylum Arthropoda, subclass Copepoda (Acartia fossae) and the phylum Chordata, class Appendicularia (Oikopleura dioica) in the Red Sea. Previous studies have shown that carotenoid–protein complexes are responsible for blue coloration in crustaceans. Therefore, we performed carotenoid metabolic profiling using both targeted and nontargeted (high-resolution mass spectrometry) approaches in four different blue-pigmented genera of copepods and one blue-pigmented species of appendicularia. Astaxanthin was found to be the principal carotenoid in all the species. The pathway analysis showed that all the species can synthesize astaxanthin from β-carotene, ingested from dietary sources, via 3 -hydroxyechinenone, canthaxanthin, zeaxanthin, adonirubin or adonixanthin. Further, using de novo assembled transcriptome of blue A. fossae (subclass Copepoda), we identified highly expressed homologous β-carotene hydroxylase enzymes and putative carotenoid-binding proteins responsible for astaxanthin formation and the blue phenotype. In blue O. dioica (class Appendicularia), corresponding putative genes were identified from the reference genome. Collectively, our data provide molecular evidences for the bioconversion and accumulation of blue astaxanthin–protein complexes underpinning the observed <b>ecological</b> functional <b>equivalence</b> and adaptive convergence among neustonic mesozooplankton...|$|R
40|$|Despite its radical {{assumption}} of <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> between species, neutral biodiversity theory can often provide good fits to species abundance distributions observed in nature. Major criticisms of neutral theory {{have focused on}} interspecific differences, which are in conflict with <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence.</b> However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at similar stages. These within-species asymmetries have not been fully explored in species-neutral models, {{and it is not}} known whether demographic stage structure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory. Here we present a two-stage neutral model where fecundity and mortality change as an individual transitions from one stage to the other. We explore several qualitatively different scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance distributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that abundance distributions are generally robust to this kind of stage structure, but significant departures from unstructured predictions occur if adults have sufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the cumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law with a 3 / 2 exponent, is invariant even when the abundance distribution departs from unstructured model predictions. Our findings potentially explain power law-like abundance distributions in organisms with strong demographic structure, such as eusocial insects and humans, and partially rehabilitate species abundance distributions from past criticisms as to their inability to distinguish between biological mechanisms.

40|$|Inland {{aquatic organisms}} almost ubiquitously display {{a pattern of}} marked provincialism {{characterized}} by substantial population differentiation and genealogical discontinuities. This {{is the result of}} strong priority effects and local adaptation following dispersal and colonization of new habitats. We present a case that defies this biogeographic paradigm. We have investigated the phylogeography of the fairy shrimp Streptocephalus torvicornis across its circum-Mediterranean and Eurasian distribution. Based on three independent datasets, namely sequence variation at 12 S and 16 S rRNA, cyst morphology and male second antenna characters, we discern a pattern of extensive genetic and morphological homogeneity pointing to unhindered gene flow and widespread connectivity among populations. These intriguing findings may provisionally be explained by (i) a high dispersal frequency overwhelming the ability of a population to maintain resource monopolization, (ii) an outbreeding vigour opportunity offered to secondary immigrants, (iii) an <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> of genotypes generating long-term immigration–extinction equilibria and buffering genetic diversity over spatial scales, (iv) enhanced bird-mediated dispersal in open habitats as opposed to ponds surrounded by forests or shrub, or (v) a shallow population history with little time for substantial genetic differentiation...|$|E

However, in biodiversity research it often remains unclear whether cryptic species {{should be treated as}} ecologically equivalent, or whether detected differences have ecologi-cal significance. In this study, we assessed the <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> of four morphologi-cally cryptic species of the amphipod genus Niphargus. All species live in a small, isolated area on the Istrian Peninsula in the NW Balkans. The distributional ranges of the species are partially overlapping and all species are living in springs. We reconstructed their ecologi-cal niches using morphological traits related to feeding, bioclimatic niche envelope and spe-cies ’ preference for epi-hypogean habitats. The ecological meaning of differences in niches was evaluated using distributional data and co-occurrence frequencies. We show that the species comprise two pairs of sister species. All species differ from each other and the degree of differentiation is not related to phylogenetic relatedness. Moreover, low co-occur-rence frequencies in sympatric zones imply present or past interspecific competition. Thi...|$|E

The 2 species are apparently similar in many respects, but their <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> is uncertain and has been little investigated, especially at the whole-lake scale. We compared the effects of the 2 species on the abundance, species richness, and composition of littoral macroinvertebrate assemblages in a set of small- and mediumsized boreal lakes, which included 8 lakes with noble crayfish, 8 lakes with signal crayfish, and 8 lakes without crayfish. We collected semiquantitative littoral macroinvertebrate samples with a kick net from 3 replicate sites in each lake. The abundance of invertebrates did not differ significantly among the 3 lake categories, but lakes with crayfish had lower species richness than lakes without crayfish. Mollusk taxa, in particular, were fewer in lakes with crayfish. Assemblage composition also differed between lakes with and without crayfish.

Accurate predictions have issued from its core premise that all species have identical vital rates. Yet no ecologist believes that species are identical in reality. Here I explain this paradox {{in terms of}} the <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> that species must achieve at their coexistence equilibrium, defined by zero net fitness for all regardless of intrinsic differences between them. I show that the distinction of realised from intrinsic vital rates is crucial to evaluating community resilience. Principal Findings: An analysis of competitive interactions reveals how zero-sum patterns of abundance emerge for species with contrasting life-history traits as for identical species. I develop a stochastic model to simulate community assembly from a random drift of invasions sustaining the dynamics of recruitment following deaths and extinctions. Species are allocated identical intrinsic vital rates for neutral dynamics, or random intrinsic vital rates and competitive abilities for niche dynamics either on a continuous scale or between dominant-fugitive extremes. Resulting communities have steady-state distributions of the same type for more or less extremely differentiated species as for identical species.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} is {{a mechanism}} aimed at achieving biodiversity gains {{to compensate for}} the residual impacts of development activities on biodiversity. Estimating the <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> of biodiversity lost to development with that gained by the offset requires a currency that captures the biota of interest and an accounting model to evaluate the exchange. Ecologically robust, and user-friendly decision support tools improve the transparency of biodiversity offsetting and assist in the decision making process. Here we describe a tool developed for the New Zealand Department of Conservation that offers a mechanism to transparently design and evaluate biodiversity offsets intended to deliver no net loss. It is a relatively disaggregated accounting model that balances like-for-like biodiversity trades using a suite of area by condition currencies to calculate net present biodiversity value (NPBV) to account individually for each measured biodiversity element of interest. The NPBV is used to evaluate whether a no net loss exchange is likely for each biodiversity attribute. More disaggregated currencies have an advantage over aggregated currencies (which use composite metrics) in that they account for each itemised biodiversity element of concern. The Disaggregated Model we present can be used to account for a variety of biodiversity types in an offset exchange, and for different scales and complexities of development and impacts within both statutory and voluntary frameworks...|$|E

Forest fires not only destroy natural environment and <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence,</b> but also threaten security of life and wealth to people. This paper presents applications of Spatio-temporal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovering (STDMKD) for forest fire prevention. The special attention of the research is paid to the spatio-temporal forecasting of forest fires because of the importance of prediction for the fire prevention. It is also {{due to the fact that}} most existing spatio-temporal forecasting methods cannot handle the dynamic development of forest fires over space. An improved spatio-temporal integrated forecasting framework – ISTIFF is proposed. The method and algorithm of ISTIFF are presented, which are illustrated by a case study of forest fire area predication in Canada. Comparative analysis of ISTIFF with other methods is implemented, which shows its high accuracy in short-term prediction.

40|$|The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity {{has been}} {{advanced}} {{as a universal}} theory for species coexistence in forests worldwide, but {{few studies have examined}} its relevance to high-elevation, stressful environments. I established the Utah Forest Dynamics Plot (UFDP) in a heterogeneous subalpine forest at 3, 091 m elevation on the Colorado Plateau to examine three underlying assumptions of neutral theory (functional equivalence, <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence,</b> and habitat generality) and one prediction (the species abundance distribution). The UFDP comprises 27, 845 stems ≥ 1 cm diameter at breast height of 17 species, 10 genera, and 6 families over 13. 6 ha. The neutral model was a poor fit to the observed species abundance distribution, but I did not find the alternative lognormal model to provide a better fit. Using spatial pattern analyses of tree data, topography, and soil type, I found some limited support for the neutral theory assumptions of functional and ecological equivalency, with notable exceptions. Populus tremuloides, Pinus flexilis, and Pinus longaeva were characterized by non-neutral recruitment processes, and Abies bifolia and Populus tremuloides exhibited asymmetric competitive and facilitative interactions. The assumption of habitat generality was strongly contradicted, with all ten abundant species in the UFDP having habitat preference. In this subalpine temperate forest, species diversity and community structure are influenced more by habitat heterogeneity, species differences, and niche selection, with neutral processes playing a lesser role...|$|E
40|$|Consequently, a {{key test}} of {{biodiversity}} {{theory has been}} how well ecological models reproduce empirical distributions of species abundances. However, ecological models with very different assumptions can predict similar species abundance distributions, whereas models with similar assumptions may generate very different predictions. This complicates inferring processes driving community structure from model fits to data. Here, we use an approximation that captures common features of “neutral” biodiversity models—which assume <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> of species—to test whether neutrality is consistent with patterns of commonness and rarity in the marine biosphere. We do this by analyzing 1, 185 species abundance distributions from 14 marine ecosystems ranging from intertidal habitats to abyssal depths, and from the tropics to polar regions. Neutrality performs substantially worse than a classical nonneutral alternative: empirical data consistently show greater heterogeneity of species abundances than expected under neutrality.

A case study about the accidental pollution of the Mimizan River from a sodium hypochlorite spill at a paper mill illustrates the new functionalities of the software. The use of the HEA method to assess ecosystem services related to biodiversity offset has been widespread thanks to the development of this user-friendly software package.

40|$|The neutral {{assumption}} that individuals {{of either the}} same or different species share exactly the same birth, death, migration, and speciation probabilities is fundamental yet controversial to the neutral theory. Several theoretical {{studies have demonstrated that}} a slight difference in species per capita birth or death rates can have a profound consequence on species coexistence and community structure. Whether asymmetry in migration, a vital demographic parameter in the neutral model, {{plays an important role in}} community assembly still remains unknown. In this paper, we relaxed the <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> assumption of the neutral model by introducing differences into species regional dispersal ability. We investigated the effect of asymmetric dispersal on the neutral local community structure. We found that per capita asymmetric dispersal among species could reduce species richness of the local community and result in deviations of species abundance distributions from those predicted by the neutral model. But the effect was moderate compared with that of asymmetries in birth or death rates, unless very large asymmetries in dispersal were assumed. A large difference in species dispersal ability, if there is, can overwhelm the role of random drift and make local community dynamics deterministic. In this case, species with higher regional dispersal abilities tended to dominate in the local community. However, the species abundance distribution of the local community under asymmetric dispersal could be well fitted by the neutral model, but the neutral model generally underestimated the fundamental biodiversity number but overestimate...|$|E
40|$|Neutral {{community}} models {{embody the}} idea that individuals are ecologically equivalent, having equal fitness over all environmental conditions, and describe how the spatial dynamics and speciation of such individuals can produce {{a wide range of}} patterns of distribution, diversity, and abundance. Neutral models have been controversial, provoking a rush of tests and comments. The debate has been spurred by the suggestion that we should test mechanisms. However, the mechanisms and the spatial scales of interest have never clearly been described, and consequently, the tests have often been only peripherally relevant. At least two mechanisms are present in spatially structured neutral models. Dispersal limitation causes clumping of a species, which increases the strength of intraspecific competition and reduces the strength of interspecific competition. This may prolong coexistence and enhance local and regional diversity. Speciation is present in some neutral models and gives a donor-controlled input of new species, many of which remain rare or are short lived, but which directly add to species diversity. Spatial scale is an important consideration in neutral models. <b>Ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> and equal fitness have implicit spatial scales because dispersal limitation and its emergent effects operate at population levels, and populations and communities are defined at a chosen spatial scale in recent neutral models; equality is measured relative to a metacommunity, and this necessitates de. ning the spatial scale of that metacommunity.

40|$|Environmental {{offsetting}} involves compensating for {{the residual}} adverse impacts {{of an action}} on the environment by generating an equivalent benefit elsewhere. As the prevalence of environmental offsetting grows, so does the challenge of translating no-net-loss goals to workable policy. From 2011 – 2012, the Australian Government developed an Environmental Offsets Policy and an accompanying metric (the Offsets Assessment Guide) to support decision making about offset requirements under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Through extensive stakeholder consultation and in collaboration with academic researchers, the Guide was developed {{with the aim of}} accounting appropriately for <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> in a transparent and flexible manner. This paper outlines the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s environmental offset policy development process, and describes the approach adopted for evaluating the suitability of proposed offsets in meeting the policy goals. The Guide explicitly estimates the extent to which an offset will improve the target biota and/or avert future losses, the degree of confidence that the offset will be implemented successfully, and the time it will take to deliver a conservation benefit. Since implementation of the Environmental Offsets Policy and the Guide, there has been a shift in focus from estimating offset requirements based on simplistic area ratios, toward directly evaluating the components of an offset action that determine its environmental performance. Achieving a balance between scientific robustness and policy workability is an ongoing challenge.

We believe {{that some of these}} concerns rest on misunderstandings generated by the difficulty to interpret economic principles from ecological viewpoints and the lack of a common language between conservationists and economists. Because this issue is vivid and the concepts not yet stabilized, key aspects of the potential advances and limits of BO to conservation practice must be clarified. This short communication (1) addresses the links between the BO concept and the central sustainability principle and (2) clarifies key assumptions regarding three potential Nature economicization roles recurrently attributed to BO. We show that the BO principle reflects a move from welfare equivalency mostly inherited from mainstream economic approach based on weak sustainability criteria toward an ecological economic approach based on strong sustainability criteria and the quest for <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence.</b> However, the way the countries implement BO influences the possibility to reach strong sustainability. Although we show that BO could be linked to a certain acceptance of “commodification”, we suggest that BO can neither be considered as a “marketization” and nor generally as a “privatization” of Nature. We therefore argue that these conceptual misunderstandings should not hamper conservation objectives and that BO must be framed within interdisciplinary approaches combining ecology, economy and socio-political aspects. We conclude that conservation science has a major role to play in defining the boundaries of BO...|$|E

40|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{biodiversity}} {{has emerged as}} a major null hypothesis in community ecology. The neutral theory may sufficiently well explain the structuring of microbial communities as the extremely high microbial diversity has led to an expectation of high <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> among species. To address this possibility, we worked with microcosms of two soils; the microcosms were either exposed, or not, to a dilution disturbance which reduces community sizes and removes some very rare species. After incubation for recovery, changes in bacterial species composition in microcosms compared with the source soils were assessed by pyrosequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. Our assays could detect species with a proportional abundance ≥ 0. 0001 in each community, and changes in the abundances of these species should have occurred during the recovery growth, but not be caused by the disturbance per se. The undisturbed microcosms showed slight changes in bacterial species diversity and composition, with a small number of initially low-abundance species going extinct. In microcosms recovering from the disturbance, however, species diversity decreased dramatically (by > 50 %); and in most cases there was not a positive relationship between species initial abundance and their chance of persistence. Furthermore, a positive relationship between species richness and community biomass was observed in microcosms of one soil, but not in those of the other soil. The results are not consistent with a neutral hypothesis that predicts a positive abundance-persistence relationship and a null effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning.

We show that a large class of neutral models with this mainland-island structure but differing local community dynamics converge in the large population limit to the hierarchical Dirichlet process. Using this approximation we developed an efficient Bayesian fitting strategy for the multisite UNTB. We can also use this approach to distinguish between neutral local community assembly given a nonneutral metacommunity distribution and the full UNTB where the metacommunity too assembles neutrally. We applied this fitting strategy to both tropical trees and a data set comprising 570 851 sequences from 278 human gut microbiomes. The tropical tree data set was consistent with the UNTB but for the human gut neutrality was rejected at the whole community level. However, when we applied the algorithm to gut microbial species within the same taxon at different levels of taxonomic resolution, we found that species abundances within some genera were almost consistent with local community assembly. This was not true at higher taxonomic ranks. This suggests that the gut microbiota is more strongly niche constrained than macroscopic organisms, with different groups adopting different functional roles, but within those groups diversity may at least partially be maintained by neutrality. We also observed a negative correlation between body mass index and immigration rates within the family Ruminococcaceae.

40|$|Understanding species {{coexistence}} and {{the maintenance}} of biodiversity has long been the central interest of ecologists. The niche-based theory of community assembly has dominated community ecology for nearly a century, yet understanding of the mechanisms of species coexistence has remained elusive. The newly developed neutral theory of biodiversity has offered a promising alternative to the niche paradigm. The analytical elegance and simplicity of the neutral theory and its predictive power have made the theory widelypopular. However, it is the very same simplicity of the theory (e. g. the symmetric assumption) that makes the theory vulnerable to stark criticisms. Widespread empirical evidence has shown that species in communities are not functionally symmetric; <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> is more a conceptual simplicity than a biological realism. Recognizing that niche and neutral processes do not have to diametrically oppose each other and a community is likely determined by the interplay of the two processes, ecologists currently are searching to reconcile the two theories by either incorporating drift into niche theory or niche into the neutral framework. However, this reconciliation process is still at its very early stage, we expect this direction will lead to a more complete understanding of community assembly mechanisms. In this paper, we provide a review on the brief histories of the niche and neutral theories, with the focus on comparing the distinct importance of the two theories in explaining community assembly. We discuss in details several integrated models that attempt to unify the niche and neutral theories. We argue that it is an essential step for any successful theory to withstand substantial experimental and field tests. The experimental tests of neutral theories are an important direction that has currently not received due attention...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} among the most species-diverse {{ecosystems}} on Earth. Their structures and ecological functions are complex to understand. Functional group is defined as a group of species that play similar roles in an ecosystem. The functional group approach has been regarded as an effective way of linking the compositions of complex ecosystems with their ecological functions. To understand the variation of functional groups in species-rich ecosystems after disturbance, the present study investigated the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of woody plants in a typically fragmented natural forest landscape of Hainan Island in South China. The study area was classified into eight landscape types based on vegetation type, disturbance manner and the time of recovery. The woody plant species were aggregated into seven functional groups based on the growth form, successional status and plant size. The results gained from the present study showed that all functional groups, except for the emergent and canopy tree species, were present in all eight landscape types. Each landscape type had different numbers of dominant functional groups. There are similar species richness and stem abundance structure among functional groups between mid-successional clear cut lowland rainforest and old growth tropical coniferous forest. This similarity exists in selective logged lowland rainforest and old-growth lowland rainforest, as well as among landscape types of montane rainforest. The functional groups with the same successional status had similar patterns of species richness and stem abundance ratios among different landscape types. The variation patterns of functional groups along the successional stages in terms of species richness and stem abundance among the tropical lowland rainforest landscape types were more similar to each other than those in the tropical montane rainforest landscape types. This study provides further support for the competition-colonization tradeoff and successional niche theory as opposed to models of neutrality and <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Species {{composition}} {{is expected to}} alter ecological function in assemblages if species traits differ strongly. Such effects are often large and persistent for nonnative carnivores invading islands. Alternatively, high similarity in traits within assemblages creates a degree of functional redundancy in ecosystems. Here we tested whether species turnover results in functional <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> or complementarity, and whether invasive carnivores on islands significantly alter such ecological function. The model system consisted of vertebrate scavengers (dominated by raptors) foraging on animal carcasses on ocean beaches on two Australian islands, one with and one without invasive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Partitioning of scavenging events among species, carcass removal rates, and detection speeds were quantified using camera traps baited with fish carcasses at the dune–beach interface. Complete segregation of temporal foraging niches between mammals (nocturnal) and birds (diurnal) reflects complementarity in carrion utilization. Conversely, functional redundancy exists within the bird guild where several species of raptors dominate carrion removal in a broadly similar way. As predicted, effects of red foxes were large. They substantially changed the nature and rate of the scavenging process in the system: (1) foxes consumed over half (55 %) of all carrion available at night, compared with negligible mammalian foraging at night on the fox-free island, and (2) significant shifts {{in the composition of}} the scavenger assemblages consuming beach-cast carrion are the consequence of fox invasion at one island. Arguably, in the absence of other mammalian apex predators, the addition of red foxes creates a new dimension of functional complementarity in beach food webs. However, this functional complementarity added by foxes is neither benign nor neutral, as marine carrion subsidies to coastal red fox populations are likely to facilitate their persistence as exotic carnivores...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect of abiotic factors on the growth of tropical dry forest tree seedlings, and the developmental plasticity that allows seedlings to respond to those factors. Different species of tropical dry forest tree seedling are demonstrated to reverse ranks in response on different combinations of light and soil environments that occur within the tropical dry forest. This is interpreted to indicate that tropical dry forest species may be niche-differentiated with respect to soil. This is found to conflict with the assumption of <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> central to neutral models of community structure. ^ Neutral models are examined further and it is determined that fitness manifolds cannot reconcile the niche-differentiation and neutral perspectives without restrictive assumptions about the distribution of environmental heterogeneity in nature. ^ Two experiments designed to test whether or not dry-forest tree species demonstrate adaptive plasticity in biomass allocation {{that is consistent with}} the balanced growth hypothesis have conflicting results. In the first study, individuals of the dry forest tree Gliricidia sepium are shown to shift their developmental allometries so that a larger fraction of biomass is allocated to leaves in high nutrient environments and a larger fraction is allocated to lateral roots in low nutrient environments, although the effect is observed only at small sizes for lateral roots. It is demonstrated that failing to account for allometry in analyses of adaptive plasticity will often lead to spurious results. It is further demonstrated that when taproot biomass is large, root: shoot ratio is a poor indicator of allocation to belowground foraging. ^ In a second experiment that includes {{the effect of}} both light and soil on G. sepium and Hymenaea coubaril, two species that differ greatly in life-history characteristics, soil is shown to have a negligible effect on morphology and biomass allocation while the effect of light is uniformly strong. Morphology is measured in terms of root and leaf surface area rather than as mass in individual biomass components. The magnitude of the plastic response is shown to be greater for G. sepium than for H. coubaril. ...|$|E
40|$|The metacommunity {{perspective}} {{appears as}} an appropriate conceptual framework to make ecology more predictive. It is particularly relevant to limnology, where exchanges of organisms and nutrients affect community and ecosystem properties from the local to the regional scales. The recent development of neutral theory appears as a step back in that direction because of the assumption of <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> {{and the absence of}} any effect of the environment on community organization. A remarkable strength of neutral theory is nonetheless to provide a general theory of diversity that accounts {{for a wide range of}} empirical observations. In this paper, we argue that neutral theory can be useful to understand the impact of dispersal on community assembly in landscapes of various complexities. Our analysis focus on spatially explicit landscapes conceptualized as networks of local communities (e. g., lakes) connected to each other by dispersal channels (e. g., rivers). The main objective of the paper is to use neutral theory to stress the importance of landscape structure on the distribution of diversity. We refer to the landscape organization as a spatial contingency that could potentially affect the coexistence mechanisms at play. We briefly review the main approaches to describe spatial networks and describe three simple toy models of metacommunity dynamics. We take this opportunity to review their assumptions and main predictions. We then conduct simulations of these models to reveal with simple examples the impact of spatial network structure on diversity distribution. The simulation results show that competitive interactions buffer the potential impact of landscape structure. The strongest relationship between node position in the landscape and species richness was observed for the patch dynamics model without any interactions. On the other hand, strong and unequal competitive interactions minimized the effect of node position. We conclude that the neutral model is a useful tool to understand the joint effects of dispersal and ecological interactions. Our analysis shows that limnologists must now integrate more realistic landscapes when analyzing community assembly from a metacommunity perspective. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most fleshy-fruited plants {{establish}} strong local {{interactions with}} a few fruit-eating species across their distribution range, which can differ among sites and {{have a major impact}} for the plant population dynamics. In turn, human disturbances alter both the original animal assemblage with which plants interact and the outcome of the mutualistic interaction. Negative consequences of human disturbances can be weakened when different seed dispersers exert similar effects on plant populations, being functionally equivalent. To understand the consequences of variability in seed dispersers on the recruitment of a long-lived tree species, I assessed changes in the assemblages of avian dispersers of Podocarpus parlatorei in subtropical Andean cloud-forests, and how these changes affect the outcome of the interaction at different spatial scales. The seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) concept, defined as the likelihood of a seed removed by a fruit-eating bird to be dispersed to a suitable site for seed survival and germination, provides the framework to compare the contributions of different birds to seed dispersal. I compared the SDE in two old-growth forests dominated by P. parlatorei and a human disturbed forest, and in the main habitat types of these sites. In all sites, highest SDE values were provided by “gulpers” that swallow the whole fleshy cone (“fruit”), predominantly Elaenia and Turdus species. SDE was highest in forest edges and secondary forests, and negligible in other habitats. Equivalence in SDE was relatively low both within and between forest sites. Human forest disturbance modified the functional equivalence, the generalization in mutualistic interactions and the strength of SDE. Secondary forests showed the higher SDE and the greater richness of dispersers high in SDE; as a consequence, the <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> increased in the most suitable habitat for recruitment. This could lead to greater resilience of plant populations to local extinctions of dispersers, and allows the recovery of human disturbed forests. This study shows that in the replacement of functional equivalent species, the outcomes of the interactions are strongly affected by disperser abundance and habitat use, at the expense of dispersers' trait redundancy on plant population dynamics and community structure...|$|E
40|$|Neutral theory {{consists}} of a suite of models that assume <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> among individual organisms. They have been most commonly applied to tropical forest tree communities either as null models or as approximations. Neutral models typically only include reproductive adults; therefore, fitting to empirical tree community data requires defining a reproductive-size threshold, which for trees is usually set arbitrarily to a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 100 mm. The inevitable exclusion of some reproductive adults and inclusion of some saplings cause a non-random sampling bias in neutral model fits. Here, we investigate this problem and resolve it by introducing simple age structure into a neutral model. We compared the performance and sensitivity of DBH threshold of three variants of a spatially explicit neutral model: the traditional model, a model incorporating random sampling and a model with two distinct age classes-reproductive adults and saplings. In the age-structured model, saplings are offspring from adults that disperse according to a Gaussian dispersal kernel around the adults. The only extra parameter is the ratio of adults to saplings, {{which is not a}} free parameter but directly measurable. We used species-area relationships (SARs) to explore the predicted effect of saplings on the species richness at different scales in our model. We then evaluated the three model variations to find the parameters required to maintain the observed level of species richness in the 50 -ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). We repeated our analysis filtering the data at different minimum tree-size thresholds in order to find the effect this threshold has on our results. Lastly, we used empirical species-individual relationships (SIRs) to test the pre-existing hypothesis that environmental filtering is the primary cause of differences between the assemblage of saplings and that of adults on BCI. Our age-structured neutral model was characterized by SARs that were insensitive to the presence of saplings at large scales and highly sensitive to them at small scales. Both models without age structure were highly sensitive to the DBH threshold chosen in a way that could not be explained based on random samplings alone. The age-structured neutral model, which allowed for non-random sampling based on life stage, was consistent with species richness observations. Our analysis of empirical SIRs did not support environmental filtering as a dominant force, but it did show evidence for other differences between age classes. Age can now be easily incorporated into future studies of neutral models whenever there is a concern that a sample is not entirely composed of reproductive adult individuals. More generally, we suggest that modeling studies using tree data subject to a minimum size threshold should consider the sensitivity of their results to that threshold...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{compensation}} is commonly employed but rarely evaluated around the world. In {{order to assess}} application of the tool in New Zealand, a systematic nationwide review was undertaken. The research used a combination of qualitative and quantitative tools (i. e. a mixed methods approach) to investigate outcomes associated with ecological compensation under the Resource Management Act 1991 and how variation among outcomes might be explained. Three key research components were addressed: compliance, practice and stakeholder perspectives. Compliance The levels of regulatory compliance were assessed in 81 consents and 245 conditions with an overall compliance level of 64. 8 %. Public organisations (75. 5 %) {{were more likely to}} comply than private companies (65. 5 %), followed by private individuals (54. 7 %). Administrative conditions (paper-based) {{were much more likely to}} be complied with (82. 6 %) than non-administrative (action based) conditions (49. 6 %). There were significant differences in compliance rates across different activities from Agriculture (4. 8 %) through to Energy Generation (100 %), demonstrating the importance of understanding the nature of non-compliance in improving regulatory compliance and enforcement. Practice The recognition of key implementation issues of ecological compensation were investigated based on the ecological exchanges approved in 110 consents. The key implementation issues were (1) equivalency, (2) spatial proximity, (3) additionality, (4) timing, (5) duration and compliance, and (6) currencies and ratios. Most exchanges approved under the RMA were ‘in-kind’ (i. e. broadly similar in type) but that their <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> was difficult to determine due to poor information. Most exchanges were close to the site of impact (65. 5 %), and those at a distance were typically the result of aggregated schemes such as mitigation trusts. Most requirements for ecological compensation can be considered to be additional, as there are few other means of compelling ecological restoration or other positive conservation activities in New Zealand. Most ecological compensation (94. 5 %) was required to be delivered concurrent with or after the activity that was approved with a range of mechanisms used to secure those outcomes. This research also showed that currencies and ratios are rarely used in the determination of ecological compensation. Stakeholder perspectives Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 116 stakeholders from a wide range of disciplines, and demonstrated that while the potential of ecological {{compensation is}} well understood and its use is well-supported (96. 5 %), most stakeholders have significant concerns about implementation. Strong support (87. 9 %) exists for a more robust and formalized approach to ecological compensation. For ecological compensation to contribute positively to the management of effects on the environment, the exchanges of biodiversity lost and gained must be robust. The present research has demonstrated that the implementation of ecological compensation in New Zealand is falling short of this expectation, and has identified a range of areas for improvement. The significant potential for failure inherent within ecological compensation requires mitigation with policy and practice improvements, and comprehensive follow-up and review of outcomes. Changes in the use of ecological compensation in New Zealand, toward a context that supports more robust exchanges and limits the potential for negative impact of the tool upon ecosystems and species are essential...|$|E
40|$|Despite a wide {{distribution}} through Africa, the genus Alcelaphus {{has been little}} studied. The aim of the work described here was the study of a population of Coke's hartebeest in the Athi Plains of Kenya, which included the Nairobi National Park. It was designed to complement existing information on the species' behaviour and to examine the interactions between the hartebeest and their food supply. The approach, both {{in the field and}} subsequently, is also described in Ch. 1. In Ch. 2 I describe the methods which are referred to frequently through later chapters. These include the field methods of counting and ageing hartebeest, the location of study areas and the sampling of vegetation, the measurement of rainfall and the collection of specimen animals. The organisation of the resulting data and their analysis are described. Descriptions of the Athi Plains are few. Their geology and topography are outlined in Ch. 3, while Ch. 4 concerns their climate, with the emphasis on rainfall as the most important seasonal parameter. The vegetation of the Nairobi Park {{and the rest of the}} plains is then described (Ch. 6) at the level of the vegetation zones for the whole plains (1850 km 2) and of vegetation types for the study areas. The Nairobi Park is shown to have a very varied vegetation despite its small size (114 km 2). In Ch. 6 the sizes and distributions of the populations of hartebeest and other numerous herbivores are described from aerial censuses over the plains and ground counts in the park. This establishes that the density of hartebeest in the park is 6. 6 times that of the plains. The latter population also contains significantly fewer adult females and young above the age of 1 month. The hartebeest in the plains show very minor population movements compared to either wildebeest or zebra, and exchange with the park population is infrequent. Using information theory methods, Ch. 7 serves to define the niche of the hartebeest in relation to those of other herbivore species, and to compare the structure of the communities of the two areas. The herbivore community of the plains also includes cattle, sheep and goats. The results of this ground-work confirm the sedentary existence of the hartebeest population, but show it to occupy a relatively wide variety of vegetation zones through the year, occupying many vegetation types and tolerating a broad range of grass standing crops. Compared to other species, the hartebeest shows a very marked seasonal occupation of vegetation types in the park, but this is not apparent in the plains. The same methods are extended to measure the similarity between species' distributions, and the cases of high overlaps are examined using published information on the feeding habits and diets of the species. Considerable ecological separation can be inferred between all species- pairs except between hartebeest and zebra in the park in the dry season, and between hartebeest and cattle in the plains in the wet season. The distributions of the latter pair in the dry season, also, suggest their <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence.</b> In Ch. 8, starting Part II, I describe the hartebeest's diet and its seasonal changes from the analysis of rumen contents. The hartebeest grazes exclusively. Its diet is described in terms of its content of grass parts, rather than grass species, amongst which Themeda triandra is shown by various sources to be predominant. The effects of the differential digestion of these parts in the rumen are reversed by applying a correction factor based on specific gravity (Appendix 12) to obtain the diet proportions. In the wet season the proportion of leaf in the diet is higher than in the sward, while the less nutritious stem is under-represented. When the leaf in the sward has been depleted in the dry season, the hartebeest no longer exercise any dietary selection. Comparison of these results with those published for zebra show that the parts taken by the 2 species are very different in proportion, and I conclude that this would result in their ecological separation even when feeding together. On the other hand, comtemporary evidence on cattle diets, also from the Athi Plains, shows them to be taking the same diet as the hartebeest, and evidence is presented that Themeda is also frequently eaten by cattle. Their coincident distributions are parallelled by similarities in their rumen morphology and bacteriology, with both classified as the only "bulk roughage grazers" in the Athi Plains community. The method developed for the correction of grass part proportions in the rumen to those in the diet allows the daily dry matter intake to be calculated from the weight of dry matter in the rumen (Ch. 9). Intake varied between 26 and 87 g/kg. W. 73. day in the dry and wet seasons respectively, through the effect of the water content of the food on its specific gravity and subsequent behaviour in the rumen. The calculated variation in intake with the succulence and quality of the food is consistent with experimental observations on the factors controlling the intake of coarse feeds by domestic ruminants. The calculated intakes are similar to those of 42 and 34 g/kg. W. 73. day of an experimental hartebeest and sheep, respectively. A regression method for predicting the hartebeest's intake under field conditions from the faecal nitrogen content is developed. In Ch. 10 the dry matter intake is converted into the intakes of protein and energy, and the gain to the hartebeest of selective feeding is calculated. Selection appears capable of increasing the digestible crude protein intake by 50 %. The calculated intakes are compared with maintenance standards for domestic ruminants and are shown to have fallen below the maintenance levels in the dry season of September 1972. Calculation of the intakes uses information from a feeding trial with hartebeest and sheep, whose intakes were also measured. The experimental hartebeest's metabolisable energy intake was 51. 5 kcal/kg. W. 73. day, which was considerably lower than the measured metabolic heat production of 116. 1 kcal/kg. W. 73. day of another tame animal. The metabolisable energy intake of the sheep of 45. 1 kcal/kg. W. 73. day suggests that the lower metabolic rate may be more correct, and further supporting evidence is presented. Chapter 11 is the first of 3 chapters in which the hartebeest's energy expenditure is considered. The daily activity patterns are described from day and night observations in the wet and dry seasons. Little seasonal variation in the regime of 3 feeding periods at nearly equal intervals through 24 hours was apparent. The total times spent feeding was 2 hours shorter at 8. 6 h/ 24 h in the dry season than the wet. About half of this reduction was made up by an increase in the time spent walking, associated with the need to visit water sources in the dry season. Further observations showed that males drank every 3 days, females every 2 days. The energy cost of this activity was almost the same in both seasons at 52 % greater than the basal metabolic energy expenditure. The use of energy for growth and the deposition of body reserves is considered in Ch. 12. The shot animals showed that full adult body weight is not reached until the fourth year, after which weight appears to decline immediately. Using a photographic method the external condition of territorial males was shown to depend on the rainfall over the previous 4 months. Non-territorial males were always in significantly better condition. The shot hartebeest were characterised by very small kidney fat reserves which showed no seasonal variation. Marrow fat varied seasonally, as did the weight of a selected muscle, representing the protein reserves of the body. The latter also changed through age, parallelling the changes in total body weight. The significance of these findings is discussed in the light of the low fat content of tropical ungulates, the hartebeest's slow growth rate and its possible adaptiveness. The small surpluses of energy ingested by the hartebeest and the small body reserves lead to a discussion of the female reproductive pattern (Ch. 13). First breeding occurs in the fourth year. Calving occurs in every month of the year. The timing and size of the birth peaks allow the conclusion that nutrition and female condition are the ultimate and proximate factors influencing reproduction. The adaptiveness of this system to a fluctuating, equatorial environment is discussed. In Ch. 14 the utilization of the resources of food and water of the park are considered. The hartebeest's seasonal use of the vegetation, mentioned in Ch. 7, is described, and is shown to be clearly defined and predictable. The data necessary for a causal analysis of the grazing cycle were not available. The quantity of standing water in the park study area is shown to depend on the rainfall over the previous 2 months. Only under exceptional conditions does animal use make significant inroads in to the water resources. Comparing this study area with those in the plains, the abundance of water in the park is due to the construction of dams rather than to any greater water-retaining capacity. In the dry season, the hartebeest aggregate around the remaining water sources. This provides evidence additional to that in Ch. 11 that the hartebeest conserve energy by reducing their activity when experiencing sub-maintenance intakes in the dry season. The significance of this to the distribution of the hartebeest in the plains is discussed. In the final discussion (Ch. 15) the ecology of the hartebeest is compared with those of several other species. Most notably, the hartebeest differs from the related wildebeest by being more sedentary, eating a poorer quality diet, growing more slowly, reaching sexual maturity later, but calving as often as conditions allow, followed by a high calf survival rate. In their "opportunistic" reproduction and prolonged mother-offspring bond, the hartebeest resemble some of the desert marsupials. The relationship between cattle and hartebeest is considered in more depth. Their <b>ecological</b> <b>equivalence</b> (Chs. 7, 8) is shown to lead to their competition both through exclusion on the part of the cattle, and exploitation for the same food. The hartebeest is the competitively inferior species, and their density and lower proportion of young animals in the plains are identified as the results of this interaction. Archaeological and historical evidence confirms that similar habitat selection by Bos spp. and Alcelaphus spp. has occurred over a long time throughout the African continent. Finally, the reasons for the predominance of the hartebeest in the park since 1961 is discussed, and it is concluded that the high densities observed in 1971 - 72 were not unusual in historical times. The management practice of burning the park's vegetation has allowed further increases in numbers, while the large numbers of cattle in the plains have caused the reverse. </p...|$|E
