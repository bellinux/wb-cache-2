Ion-exchange capacity/equivalent weight, water take-up, thickness change on hydration and ionic and electrical conductivity were measured in 1 mol dm- 3 sulfuric acid at 298 K. The TiO 2 filler significantly impacted on these properties, producing higher water take-up and increased conductivity. Such membranes may be beneficial for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell operation at low humidification. The PEM fuel cell performance of the composite membranes containing SiO 2 fillers was examined in a Ballard Mark 5 E unit cell. While the use of composite membranes offers a cost reduction, the unit cell performance was reduced, in practice, due to drying of the ionomer at the cathode...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a three-dimensional constitutive model of active polymeric materials, including changes in material volume and properties due to actuation. Active polymers reversibly change shape, volume and/or material properties {{in response to}} some external stimulus. Electric fields are a common driving force for this actuation, though changes in pH, temperature, magnetic field, or visible light have been studied in their role as stimuli. The study and future use of conducting polymer actuators is important because of their potential to meet and exceed the capabilities of currently available materials {{in a variety of}} fields, most notably in the field of artificial muscles. This thesis first reviews the basic principles of continuum mechanics, followed by a review of the classical and current statistical mechanics based constitutive models for rubber-like materials. A theoretical model for reversibly swelling active polymer gels is presented. Material responses to different homogeneous deformation conditions are then studied as a function of swelling. The effect of <b>inert</b> rigid <b>filler</b> <b>particles</b> on the swelling behavior of an active polymer is then studied using a closed-form solution of a boundary value problem developed in the literature. The constitutive model is also used in a study of the behavior of a bimorph strip, noting that the responsive nature of active polymers is often mechanically accentuated by layering with other materials, with implications for future work on transient analysis. Finite element analysis is implemented for verification and analysis of the boundary value problem. by Scott V. Therkelsen. Thesis (S. M.)

The inks are complex and composed of {{electrically conductive}} acicular (needle-like) refractory <b>filler</b> <b>particles</b> dispersed in an insulating organic base ink. Inks mixed, prepared and stored in a variety of conditions have been studied using high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam and EDX elemental analysis in conjunction with DC electrical characterization. The research has aimed to investigate possible links between the structure and electrical behaviour of the inks. The results have shown that inks stored for greater amounts of time, prior to printing, lose touch sensitivity. Causes for this are uncertain, but may be linked with the growth of nanoscale features on the <b>filler</b> <b>particles</b> and partial settling of constituents. EDX analysis revealed candidate elements for the nanoscale features found on <b>filler</b> <b>particles.</b> Modeling current-voltage plots with non-linear fits has shown there might be a switching of conduction mechanism with increasing compression of the inks. Additionally, the unclear process by which inks lose touch sensitivity was shown to be temperature dependent.
