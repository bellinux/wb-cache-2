50|$|Etheostoma akatulo {{was listed}} as a federally {{endangered}} species in 1993. Existing and potential threats to continued survival of the species include habitat destruction from <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging,</b> which has already eliminated habitat once occupied by the species in Collins River; pesticides in runoff or groundwater from plant nurseries; siltation from gravel mining, agricultural runoff, or land-disturbing activities; and acid mine drainage from headwater streams. The most significant factor contributing to the bluemask darter's decline was likely {{the building of the}} Great Falls Dam. The reservoir impounded by the dam flooded over 80 kilometers of possible bluemask darter habitat and isolated the tributary populations from each other. Because of the isolation, the genetic viability {{over a long period of}} time is questionable for the species. One of the current plans for management is the reintroduction of Etheostoma akatulo to the Calfkiller River. Because of <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging</b> the substrate in Calfkiller River is not ideal so first they are making new sand and gravel substrates. Then, the reintroduction of the fish will begin.|$|E
50|$|Threats {{affecting}} the pygmy madtom are increased urbanization, coal mining, toxic chemical spills, siltation, improper pesticide use, and stream bank erosion. Additional threats include <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging,</b> water withdrawals, and agricultural practices. None {{of the threats}} has been eliminated since the fish was listed; consequently, both the Duck and Clinch River populations remain vulnerable to extirpation. Existing federal and state laws and regulations are applied to actions conducted {{within the range of}} pygmy madtom to protect the fish and its habitats. However, due to difficulty in finding the fish in surveys, the extent of its habitat is unknown.|$|E

50|$|S. acuticauda is {{classified}} as being endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale behind {{this is that the}} riverine habitats in which it breeds are under threat in much of southeastern Asia and, although it has an extensive range, it is believed to be extinct or almost extinct in southern China, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Only in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are there larger populations, and even in these countries, this bird is thought to be on the decline, and there may be fewer than ten thousand mature individuals in existence. The threats it faces include the degradation of the islands and sandspits on which it breeds, the collection of eggs for food, predation of eggs and chicks by dogs, cats and crows, flooding of nesting sites by the construction of river dams, competition for fish by local fishermen, entanglement in nets, disturbance, extraction of water, sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging</b> and pollution.|$|E

As from 1903, Ackermans & van Haaren almost continuously executed infrastructure projects in several countries of Latin America. For ten years, the company was building and expanding the port of Rosario (Santa Fe) in Argentina. In 1912, total volume handled at Rosario was estimated at 9.5 million m3 of dredging and 5.7 million m3 of reclamation. Other dredging works in Argentina in those years were executed at La Plata, Bahía Blanca, Puerto Belgrano, San Nicolas, Ensenada, Sorento, Quequén, the Paraná Delta, the Matschwitz canal, a.o. From 1910 till 1913 Ackermans & van Haaren built a 1150 m long tunnel in Buenos Aires, supplying water from the Rio de la Plata. Other Latin American countries where Ackermans & van Haaren was active before the First World War include Uruguay, where the company built the port of Montevideo and carried out <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging</b> near Colón, and Brazil where 8.5 million m3 were dredged in the port of Rio Grande do Sul between 1908 and 1916.) ...|$|E
50|$|The bigeye shiner (Notropis boops) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Notropis. This fish is a slender, slivery minnow with a dusky lateral stripe and a maximum total length of about 80 mm. Its {{distinct}} characteristic is its large-diameter eyes. It is a common species in upland streams of the middle Mississippi River system. Bigeye shiners prefer warm, quiet pools with clear water and silt-free substrates. Siltation, channelization, and <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging</b> are all threats to bigeye shiner populations. During spawning season, typically late April to August, bigeye shiners have several clutches of eggs. State agencies and the EPA have both {{played a role in}} the surveying of bigeye shiner populations. Populations have decreased in Ohio due mostly to habitat destruction. In addition to habitat destruction by humans, habitat alteration of the small streams and dried pools has also had a significant effect on abundance. Rivers and streams should not be channelized or modified in any way, which is becoming an increasingly popular trend in urban locations. Agricultural areas and properties within the watershed should adhere to regulations to prevent runoff into the streams.|$|E
40|$|The {{phytoplankton}} and, to {{a limited}} extent, the attached algae of four gravel pits in the Thames Valley were investigated. The pits are in two pairs, one old and the other recently excavated. In all <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging</b> has been in progress and the water of each could be clearly divided into that fairly frequently disturbed by gravel grab and that which was not so disturbed. The distribution of the algae {{in general and the}} seasonal variation for certain algae or groups of algae were considered and attempts were made to correlate these with the physical and chemical features of the environment. The maximum of an alga was not always simultaneous in all the pits. Certain algae favoured the new pits and others the old ones, but many appeared to be indifferent. Similarly, while some of the algae tended to favour the disturbed or the undisturbed water of a pit, many {{did not appear to be}} affected by disturbance and were apparently equally distributed over the pit. An attempt has been made to compare the phytoplankton of the Thames in the neighbourhood of the pits with that of the pit which is in permanent communication with the river. While, except for six species found only in the river, the species list is the same, an alga did not always occur in the river and pit samples simultaneously. <p...|$|E

40|$|The ocean {{accommodates}} a {{wide variety}} of uses that are separated by time of day, season, location, and zones. Conflict can and does occur, however, when two or more groups wish to use the same space {{at the same time in}} an exclusive manner. The potential for conflict is well known and the management of ocean space and resources has been, and is being, addressed by a number of State, regional, and Federal organizations, including, among others, coastal zone management agencies, state task forces, and regional fisheries management councils. However, with new and emerging uses of the ocean, such as aquaculture and offshore renewable energy, comes the potential for new types of space-use conflicts in ocean waters. In recent years, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (formerly the Minerals Management Service [MMS]) has examined ocean space-use conflicts and mitigation strategies in the context of offshore oil and gas exploration and production and sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>dredging,</b> activities that are both subject to BOEM regulation and oversight. BOEM now has authority to issue leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for renewable energy projects, but seeks additional information on potential conflicts between existing uses of the ocean environment and this new form of activity. The broad purpose of this study was to begin to fill this gap by (1) identifying potential spaceuse conflicts between OCS renewable energy development and other uses of the ocean environment, and (2) recommending measures that BOEM can implement in order to promote avoidance or mitigation of such conflicts, thereby facilitating responsible and efficient development of OCS renewable energy resources. The result is a document intended to serve as a desktop resource that BOEM can use to inform its decision making as the agency carries out its statutory and regulatory responsibilities...|$|E

40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the use of some ultra-accelerated mortar bar expansion test methods for assessing the alkali-silica reactivity of concrete aggregates (particularly those using 1 M NaOH solution at 80 oC) can give rise to misleading results causing certain types of aggregates to be inappropriately accepted. This is the case if the aggregates contain more than 2 % by mass of reactive constituents, in the form of porous chert or flint and chalcedony. To date, no explanations have been given for this anomaly. This paper deals with a study aimed at investigating this anomaly.

As part of the privately funded development, a quay wall was built facing the river, with a second wall built further inland. The gap between these walls was filled with sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>dredged</b> from the Liffey. The project commenced in 1716, with the initial phase completed by the early 1720s. John Rocque's 1756 map of Dublin shows Rogerson's quay as largely developed by the mid-18th century. During the early 19th century, the quay serviced larger freight vessels, including colliers which brought coal (from ports like Whitehaven in England) to feed the coal and gas works at nearby Hanover Quay. By the 20th century, Sir John Rogerson's Quay was home to a number of storehouse types, including cold stores and 'campshire' sheds.

40|$|Executive Summary: To further {{understand}} the separation process used by CSN-ERSA in Brazil, ore characterization of final concentrate samples was determined through Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) testing. Characterization of each concentrate shows {{a significant amount}} of heavy metal contamination; a result of inefficient gravity separation. CSN is looking to implement a mining method suitable for extracting ore at the Village site. The three options of mining methods are open-pit with <b>gravel</b> pumping, <b>dredging,</b> and a conveyor system. The conveyor system is recommended as the primary mining method because conveyors can upgrade production capacity, along with minimizing capital and annual costs. Also, they provide path adaptability by operating in steeper terrain. Gravity separation methods and recommendations for mineral processing at the Taboquiñha site is discussed. These include spirals, hydrocyclones, Knelson, Falcon, and tables. The final recommendation is a combination of methods, with variation depending on focus. Much like current operations, spirals and hydrocyclones can receive most of the material. For recovering fines, installing a Falcon gravity separator is recommended. The currently reprocessed middling could see improvements if a table separator were installed. For recovering tin lost in the tailings, it is recommended to use a Falcon separator...|$|R

30|$|Dredging {{granular}} soils is also {{a source}} of subsidence, specifically around Qods (i.e. northern parts of both plains). Similar to the clay pits, cavities generated by dredging affect aqueduct recharge pattern, lower water table, and eventually lead to ground subsidence. <b>Dredging</b> <b>gravel</b> and sand from rivers {{in the area for}} use in construction has resulted in removing the permeable layer and consequently lower water penetration and aquifer recharge. Thus, aquifer recharge from Kan River has reduced significantly causing lower groundwater elevation. These extractions often continue upon total removal of granular layers and reaching clay layers. Groundwater changes maps reveal that Kan and Karaj rivers have experienced relative water rise, while water table drop was measured in surrounding lands. This reduction proves the decline in aquifer recharge from these rivers.|$|R
