5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu the Good) of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money. A family council was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where {{it was decided that}} al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin's nephew, would launch an expedition against the coastal region of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} an argument of Harvey Siegel's {{according to which}} {{there can be no}} hypothetical normativity anywhere unless there is categorical normativity in epistemology.

5|$|The {{unilateral}} French decision led to {{a censure}} debate in the House of Commons. By 1967, when the French decided {{to withdraw from the}} AFVG programme, the Air Ministry was faced with a dilemma stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F-111K, a decision that was taken in November 1967, to be formalized on 20 March 1968. Up to this point, Britain had spent £2.5 on the AFVG for practically no gains. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the absence of any new strike aircraft following the failure of multiple projects to develop or procure one, Healey decided to entirely dismantle the requirement for one. Thus, in 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, alongside Healey, announced that British troops would be withdrawn in 1971 from major military bases in South East Asia, the Persian Gulf and the Maldives, collectively known as 'East of Suez'.|$|E
5|$|As {{with various}} other ethnic {{minorities}} {{who lived in}} the Soviet Union under Stalin, tens of thousands of Armenians were executed or deported. In 1936, Beria and Stalin worked to deport Armenians to Siberia in an attempt to bring Armenia's population under 700,000 <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> an annexation into Georgia. Under Beria's command, police terror was used to strengthen the party's political hold on the population and suppress all expressions of nationalism. Many writers, artists, scientists and political leaders, including the writer Axel Bakunts and the celebrated poet Yeghishe Charents, were executed or forced into exile. Additionally, in 1944, roughly 200,000Hamshenis (Sunni Muslim Armenians who live near the Black Sea coastal regions of Russia, Georgia and Turkey) were deported from Georgia to areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Further deportations of Armenians from the coastal region occurred in 1948, when 58,000 alleged supporters of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Greeks were forced to move to Kazakhstan.|$|E

25|$|Concerning the {{improper}} {{access of}} Facebook's secret information, {{the court found}} the allegations set forth by Facebook improper <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the claim. Neither could Facebook prove any illegal appropriation of the source code, nor was the information accessed {{by one of the}} founders of StudiVZ as a registered member of Facebook improperly obtained. Equally, the reliance on general security blackouts was found insufficient.|$|E
25|$|There was {{outrage over}} the closure plan: critics pointed out {{that this was a}} main line, not a small branch railway. The {{campaign}} uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a dirty tricks campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> its closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.|$|E

25|$|Mathews {{suggests}} {{the risk of}} nuclear terrorism remains unprevented. In 1999 during the Kosovo War, the U.S. supported the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a that was recognised as a terrorist organisation by the U.S. some years prior. Right before the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia took place, the U.S. took down the KLA {{from the list of}} internationally recognized terrorist organizations <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> their aid and help to the KLA.|$|E
25|$|The War was {{the first}} {{conflict}} in which military action was precipitated by media involvement. The war grew out of U.S. interest in a fight for revolution between the Spanish military and citizens of their Cuban colony. American yellow press fanned the flames {{of interest in the}} war by fabricating atrocities during the Cuban War of Independence, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> intervention in a number of Spanish colonies worldwide, like Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam and the Caroline Islands.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Tabacco {{addiction}} {{is defined by}} the DSM IV as a pathological dependency. Tobacco use causes 5. 000. 000 deaths yearly, 80 - 90, 000 in Italy. Frequently, smokers underestimate the harm caused by smoke and resort to the use of stereotypes <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify,</b> <b>to</b> themselves and to others, their behaviour. Methods. During the period between October 2005 and March 2006, a form containing 22 stereotypes was distributed to 140 subjects: 70 from the Respiratory Physiopathology Service of our hospital, considered as the ÒsickÓ subjects (group A) and 70 subjects who had contacted the anti-smoking therapeutic program of the same hospital. Results. The subjects who voluntarily went into a smoking-cessation program had a more objective view of the tobacco problem than those subjects who had not matured a choice to stop smoking, even though they were afflicted by smoke related pathologies (group A). In fact, from a qualitative point of view, the subjects of group A tended to use almost all the proposed stereotypes more frequently, even if the quantitative difference in the answers was not significant. Conclusions. This research confirms that the smoker is often ÒforcedÓ not to the face reality, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> take refuge <b>in</b> a state of incomplete awareness, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> continue to satisfy his dependence, trying to minimize his discomforts and sense of guilt...|$|R
25|$|In May 2011, U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal, {{after a year}} of investigation, found Charles Fahy had {{intentionally}} withheld The Ringle Report {{drafted by}} the Office of Naval Intelligence, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the Roosevelt administration's actions in the cases of Hirabayashi v. United States and Korematsu v. United States. The report would have undermined the administration's position of the military necessity for such action, as it concluded that most Japanese Americans were not a national security threat, and that allegations of communication espionage had been found to be without basis by the FBI and Federal Communications Commission.|$|E
25|$|Some Japanese {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 by King Jangsu of Goguryeo, as describing a Japanese invasion {{in the southern}} portion of the Korean peninsula. However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, {{it can be argued}} that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|First, {{the court}} held that an {{imitation}} leading to confusion as to the source of the websites and the associated free riding on the goodwill of Facebook's website requires a certain degree of public awareness of the website. However, {{at the time of the}} introduction of StudiVz to the German market (November 2005) Facebook had not yet established the critical level of awareness <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> a claim for improper imitation of a famous website. Rather, until September 2006, Facebook was only designed for North American students and thus did not reach the required degree of public awareness.|$|E

The village with coordinates 40° 42' N 021° 16' E has been renamed Melas in his honour, as he was a glorious Greek.

5|$|Strategically, {{the group}} {{experienced}} internal divisions between a faction that argued for more offensive {{and another that}} wanted <b>to</b> thread lightly <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>justifying</b> the classification of terrorism.

25|$|His father betrothed him to Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé, niece of the {{powerful}} Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of the king, before he joined the army in 1640. Despite being barely twenty {{years of age and}} in love with Mlle du Vigean (Marthe Poussard, called mademoiselle du Vigean, daughter of the king's gentleman of the bedchamber François Poussard, marquis de Fors and baron du Vigean, by his wife Anne de Neubourg, daughter of Roland, sieur de Sercelles), he was compelled by his father to marry his fiancée, a child of thirteen. Although she bore her husband three children, Enghien later claimed she committed adultery with different men <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> locking her away at Châteauroux, but the charge was widely disbelieved: Saint-Simon, while admitting that she was homely and dull, praised her virtue, piety and gentleness in the face of relentless abuse.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the Peninsular War in 1814, {{the courts}} of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> {{continuing}} to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state. However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the Liberal Revolution of 1820), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the 1817 Pernambucan Revolt.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to how the}} Protestant Reformers {{were often}} characterized, {{the concept of a}} catholic or {{universal}} Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began {{in the early days of}} the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
