[...] Kurtz disavowed the Toledo convention's endorsement of Hanna, describing the gathering as controlled by the senator's paid agents. He stated his case against Hanna: [...] "The returns of the recent election show that he is not wanted by the party. [...] The days of Mr. Hanna's bossism are over. [...] The people here are against him, and that settles it." ...|$|E

For three weeks it was my privilege to visit there. Loma Linda is certainly in keeping with what its name implies--Hill Beautiful. It is located in an ideal spot, and, in my opinion, is as pretty as pictured. To receive a training there must be deemed a privilege. The advantages and opportunities are excellent, and come up to one's expectations.|$|E
