40|$|The downstructure {{of viewing}} {{geologic}} maps, balanced and cross sections, and hanging-wall-sequence diagrams {{are applied to}} produce the first comprehensive synthesis of the structure below the willard thrust sheet. Development of the duplex beneath the Willard thrust may be explained with a 2 ̆ 2 piggyback 2 ̆ 2 thrust model where younger thrust slices form below and fold an older, overlying thrust sheet. Progressive failure of the footwall ramp of the Willard thrust sheet <b>extended</b> the <b>sole</b> thrust eastward and produced a duplex consisting of thrust slices (horses) which adhered to the overriding thrust sheet where it ramped from a lower sole thrust to an upper decollement horizon. The resulting structural culmination produced a distinct antiform in the Willard thrust sheet. The duplex is here named the Ogden duplex. Frontal folds (formed at ramps perpendicular to transport) and lateral folds (formed at ramps parallel to transport) mark the margin of Individual horses within the duplex. Folded thrusts, thrust-splay relationships, and lateral overlap of horses help determine the sequence of thrusting. The involvement of cratonic foreland basement rocks (Farmington Canyon Complex) in thrust slices within the Ogden duplex {{is similar to the}} Moine thrust belt in northern Scotland and pinpoints this area within zone III of Boyer and Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) model of a thrust system dominated by a major thrust sheet.

Kid cleaves RNA and inhibits protein synthesis and cell growth in Escherichia coli. Here, {{we show that}} Kid promotes RNA degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. These new activities of the Kid toxin were counteracted by the Kis antitoxin and were not displayed by the KidR 85 W variant, which is nontoxic in E. coli. Moreover, while Kid cleaved single- and double-stranded RNA with a preference for UAA or UAC triplets, KidR 85 W maintained this sequence preference but hardly cleaved double-stranded RNA. Kid was formerly shown to inhibit DNA replication of the ColE 1 plasmid. Here we provide in vitro evidence that Kid cleaves the ColE 1 RNA II primer, which {{is required for the}} initiation of ColE 1 replication. In contrast, KidR 85 W did not affect the stability of RNA II, nor did it inhibit the in vitro replication of ColE 1. Thus, the endoribonuclease and the cytotoxic and DNA replication-inhibitory activities of Kid seem tightly correlated.

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the one-year mortality in the cohort of patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction procedures in our centre. Records of the patients undergoing transvenous lead removal in the Department of Cardiology and Electrotherapy of the Medical University of Gdańsk were analyzed. We collected detailed information about 192 patients that had undergone the procedure from January 2003 until June 2012. Data were collected from medical and surgical records. We analyzed concomitant diseases, indications, and possible complications. Long-term follow-up data were gathered in the follow-up ambulatory records and over-the-phone interviews with patients or families.

40|$|Since its advent, Building Information Modelling {{approach}} has been gradually <b>extended</b> from the <b>sole</b> representation of the Building and of its components (BIM 3 D) to the management of knowledge related to construction time (BIM 4 D), costs estimation (BIM 5 D) and building life cycle (BIM 6 D). Nevertheless, a relevant factor as the building functional response to the activities of its intended users is still underrepresented by current BIM and IFC models. As result, designers are still forced to make decisions that will impact the building future use just relying on norms, regulations and manuals, or on their previous professional experience. The consequences are often clear in our world: after their construction, many buildings don’t work as expected, but it is usually too late or too costly to intervene. The research described in this paper aims at: 1) extending the current BIM approach in order to include semantics related to the building use process; 2) integrate this model with a virtual simulation environment, where the designers can observe how the building will interact with its intended users. The proposed model {{is based on an}} ontology-based representation of the building use process, structured in terms of activities performed, users involved and building spaces where they are located. This static representation is associated to a simulation engine derived from the videogames industry, where the use process previously formalized is simulated and dynamically visualized. This system allows designers and clients to predict and evaluate how the building will be used and experienced before it will be actually realized and occupied, when it is still possible to in-crease the quality of the final product and solve errors and problems.

40|$|The Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus (Lockington) is {{a fairly}} large {{flatfish}} belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is not a true sole, but a flounder. However, through continued common usage of the term "sole" {{for most of the}} flounders along the Pacific Coast, this appellation has become recognized by the fishing industry and the different government agencies concerned. It has been known along the Pacific Coast under several different common names, such as slippery sole (California and Puget Sound), lemon sole (Vancouver), smear dab (Puget Sound), rubber sole and short finned sole (San Francisco), slime sole (California and Puget Sound), tongue sole, and Dover sole (Pacific Coast). The common name of Dover sole was first suggested by Mr. Stewart, employee of the New England Fish Co., Astoria, Oregon, around 1939 according to the Eureka fishermen. He probably associated Microstomus pacificus, the only representative of its genus along the eastern Pacific Coast, with Microstomus kitt Walbaum, which ranges from the White Sea into English waters and is probably taken off the Dover coast. The two species are very similar in general appearance and might well appear identical to an untrained observer, but in meristic counts and morphometric measurements they differ significantly. In 1946, Clemens and Wilby used the name Dover sole in their Fishes of the Pacific Coast of Canada, and in 1948 it was adopted as the official name in California by the Department of Fish and Game. It is evident that the name Dover sole has a greater marketing value than some of the other names, such as slime sole, slippery sole, etc., with their rather unappetizing connotations. Although the range of the Dover <b>sole</b> <b>extends</b> from Southern California to Alaska, it is important commercially only from San Francisco northward along the Oregon coast. Small amounts have been landed in Washington and British Columbia, but the centers of fishing are at Fort Bragg and Eureka in California, and at Newport and Astoria in Oregon. South of Monterey it is not found in great abundance. In developing a management program for the conservation of a fisheries resource, a knowledge of the biology of the species concerned is important. Full utilization of the population is desirable, but a balance must be maintained between the recruitment and the total mortality. Regulation of fishing areas, closed seasons, restrictions on destructive gear, and limitations on total catch are tools that may be used in the maintenance of a fisheries resource at the most productive level, but their use should be based on sound reasoning and biological facts. It is in the hope of providing a few of the required facts that this study is presented. In the course of this investigation approximately 3, 200 specimens of Dover sole were examined during the period from July, 1948, to October, 1949. The bulk of the material was gathered from commercial fishermen and dealers in the Eureka region, although a small amount of sampling was conducted at Fort Bragg. After the fish are taken from the vessel during normal commercial handling, they are weighed by the dealer and dumped in a pile near the end of a conveyor system. The measuring board was placed on a fish box or bench as close to this source of supply as possible, and specimens were taken at random from the pile. Each fish was weighed, laid on the board with the nose against the end plate and the total length measured. The abdominal wall was cut to determine the sex and to obtain gonad samples. Stomach contents were sampled in some cases. If scales were required they were taken by means of a pair of forceps and either placed in an envelope or put directly on a slide. Otoliths were taken by holding the fish firmly with the left hand (thumb in the lower eye orbit) and making a diagonal cut into the head exposing the brain and inner ears. Otoliths were taken from both sides, placed in an envelope, and preserved dry. All data were recorded on a white plastic sheet with a lead pencil. In this way, the sampler, with wet slimy hands, could write down the necessary information and by washing the sheet in water have a clean neat record. After transferring the information to paper, the plastic sheet was washed with a cleanser to remove the pencil marks...|$|R
