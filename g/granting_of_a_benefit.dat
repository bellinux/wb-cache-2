40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} targeting benefits when the decision-maker cannot ascertain an applicant's income, but can assign probabilities {{with respect to the}} level <b>of</b> his resources. <b>A</b> decision-theoretic framework is used to analyze the decision to <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> fixed size. The proposed rule consists in balancing the expected social cost of denying assistance to the needy (type-I error) against that <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> to <b>a</b> non-poor (type-II error). Thus, when the costs of type-I errors are on the rise, or those of type-II errors fall, it becomes more desirable to increase population coverage of the programme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>a</b> reform <b>of</b> the French welfare system. More precisely, it is <b>a</b> question <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> <b>a</b> decreasing <b>benefit</b> {{according to}} earned income. The modulation of this benefit {{according to the}} family size and the rent is clarified in detail. Several alternatives of the reform are analyzed and quantified by means of microsimulations on the French sample of the European Panel. The redistributive impact, including financing, is then studied using a new two-dimensional dominance criterion (dimensions income and family size) introducing <b>an</b> interval <b>of</b> acceptable equivalence scales. This criterion allows to conclude to the redistributive interest of the reform whereas the usual criteria, {{which are based on}} unbounded equivalence scales, lead to a vague diagnostic.
