40|$|This program {{determines the}} {{supersonic}} flowfield surrounding three-dimensional wing-body configurations of a delta wing. It {{was designed to}} provide the numerical computation of three dimensional inviscid, flowfields of either perfect or real gases about supersonic or <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplanes.</b> The governing equations in conservation law form are solved by a finite difference method using a second order noncentered algorithm between {{the body and the}} outermost shock wave, which is treated as a sharp discontinuity. Secondary shocks which form between these boundaries are captured automatically. The flowfield between the body and outermost shock is treated in a shock capturing fashion and therefore allows for the correct formation of secondary internal shocks.

5000|$|Therefore, another {{trick to}} achieve lower {{stresses}} is {{that rather than}} picking up a cargo from the ground at zero velocity, a rotovator could pick up a moving vehicle and sling it into orbit. For example, a rotovator could pick up a Mach 12 aircraft from the upper atmosphere of the Earth and move it into orbit without using rockets, and could likewise catch such a vehicle and lower it into atmospheric flight. It is easier for a rocket to achieve the lower tip speed, so [...] "single stage to tether" [...] has been proposed. One such is called the <b>Hypersonic</b> <b>Airplane</b> Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL). Either air breathing or rocket to tether could save {{a great deal of}} fuel per flight, and would permit for both a simpler vehicle and more cargo.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Hypersonic</b> <b>Airplane</b> Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL) {{system is}} a novel {{architecture}} for an Earth-to-orbit launch system consisting of: a completely reusable airbreathing subsonic-to-hypersonic dual-fuel airplane which transports the payload from the ground to some intermediate point in the upper atmosphere; an orbiting spinning space tether system which picks up the payload from the intermediate point and takes it on into orbit; and a grapple assembly for transferring the payload from the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplane</b> to {{the lower end of}} the space tether. The system is revolutionary in that it minimizes, and perhaps even eliminates, the use of rockets for Earth-to-orbit launch of satellite payloads and even passengers. For the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplane</b> portion of the HASTOL system we use an existing Boeing design for the DF- 9, a dual-fuel airbreathing launcher that has benefited from over a million dollars in NASA/LaRC and Boeing funding during prior study efforts.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of two methods proposed to reduce the high sinking speeds and improve the landing characteristics of low-aspect-ratio <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplanes</b> by placing the wing at large angles of sideslip to increase its effective aspect ratio. The models investigated had conical fuselages and arrow wings, with a leading-edge sweep-back of 77. 4 deg, an aspect ratio of 1. 23, and a 4 -percent-thick straight-wedge section. For one model, the wing was pivoted on the fuselage to angles of wing sideslip from 0 to 90 deg. For the other model, the wing was fixed to the fuselage, and the wing and fuselage were yawed together to sideslip angles from 0 to 90 deg. The investigation was made in the Langley 300 -MPH 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel for an angle-of-attack range from - 8 to above 28 deg. Longitudinal stability and control through the use of horizontal tails with elevators was studied on the pivoted-wing configuration. The roll control for both configurations was studied with deflection of the apex portion of the wing about an axis along the wing center line. The use of flaps with the wing at large sideslip angles was also investigated...|$|R

It {{is designed for}} long duration sub-orbital space tourism missions, {{in the frame of}} the Space Renaissance (SR) Italia Space Tourism Program. The vehicle is also consistent with a point-to-point medium range hypersonic trip, within the "urgent business travel" market segment. The design of such a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplane</b> is based on the concept of integrating available technologies developed for aeronautical and space atmospheric re-entry systems. The vehicle, characterized by high aerodynamic efficiency and low wing loading, is able to provide aerodynamic stability and manoeuvrability along the flight path and to produce a reduced sonic boom during cruise and supersonic descent approach, ensuring a very limited environmental impact. HyPlane, powered by Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) engines plus a throtteable Rocket, is able to perform Horizontal Takeoff and Horizontal Landing (HTHL) on runways. Aerodynamic and propulsive performances for the different flight regimes encountered during the missions are studied. Aerodynamic heating effects are analyzed, in order to identify suitable structures and materials design to sustain the hypersonic flight conditions.

40|$|A {{strategic}} {{vision has}} been proposed by DLR which ultimately {{has the potential to}} enable sustainable low-cost space transportation to orbit. The baseline idea is simple and quite conventional: Strongly surging the number of launches per year and hence dramatically shrinking manufacturing and operating cost of launcher hardware. The obvious challenge of the vision is to identify the very application creating this new, large-size market. All recent assessments of the launch business are sobering. Nevertheless a market, well beyond the recent assessment, could be created if the conventional thinking of what rocket propelled vehicles are to be used for is exceeded. Ultra fast transportation, much faster than supersonic and even potential <b>hypersonic</b> <b>airplanes,</b> is definitely a fundamental new application for launch vehicles. Even in the case that only a very small portion of the upper business travel segment could be tapped by a rocket-propelled intercontinental passenger transport, the resulting launch rates per year would be far in excess of any other credible scenario. By no more than partially tapping the huge intercontinental travel and tourist market, production rates of RLVs and their rocket engines could increase hundredfold which is out of reach for all other known earth-orbit space transportation applications. The fast intercontinental travel form of space tourism, not only attracting the leisure market, would, as a byproduct, enable to also considerably reduce the cost of space transportation to orbit...|$|R

As the goal is to find the optimal preliminary SpaceLiner design which considers all main disciplines (geometry, aerodynamics, structural masses and thermal protection system), multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) techniques have to be applied. In simulation-based engineering applications, oftentimes no derivatives are available. Thus, we would like to present our new optimization algorithm, a model-based trust-region SQP algorithm, to solve equality-constrained optimization problems without derivatives.

40|$|An RBCC engine {{combines}} {{air breathing}} and rocket engines {{into a single}} engine to increase the specific impulse over an entire flight trajectory. Considerable research pertaining to RBCC propulsion was performed during the 1960 's and these engines were revisited recently as a candidate propulsion system for either a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) or two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle.
