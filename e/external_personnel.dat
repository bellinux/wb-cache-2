40|$|To {{ensure that}} the <b>external</b> <b>personnel</b> {{dosimetry}} program conducted by U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) contractors is of the highest quality, the DOE established the Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program or DOELAP. The contractor`s dosimetry program is assessed against the criteria set forth for dosimeter performance and the associated quality assurance and calibration programs. Although personnel dosimeters are not processed or calibrated by Fermilab, a proactive quality assurance program is in place to ensure accurate monitoring. This program includes quarterly blind testing of the dosimeters used by personnel. During the on-site assessment conducted of Fermilab`s external dosimetry program during May 1994, an observation with regard to equipment maintenance and calibration was made: ``calibration personnel should probably review the electron secondary equilibrium needs at various irradiation distances from the {sup 137 }Cs irradiation systems`` The majority of the secondary electrons are generated through interactions of the beam with the collimator. Secondary electrons increase the low energy component of the radiation field, increasing the shallow doses measured. For dosimetric purposes, this increase needs to be defined so appropriate corrections to calculations or modifications to the facility can be made. Prompted by this observation, a {{study was designed to}} investigate the electron secondary equilibrium in the facility used for the blind testing by determining the dose equivalent as a function of depth in a tissue-equivalent medium.

40|$|The {{trend for}} {{diagnosis}} of diseases {{in the arena}} of both human and animal health has long been moving in the direction of molecular technology. By identifying the pathogen on a molecular level, we not only achieve a fast and reliable diagnosis, but we are also able to make meaningful conclusions as to the origin of the organism and thereby its molecular epidemiology and pathogenicity. In the current climate, the challenge is to provide people with the appropriate skills and knowledge base to undertake molecular diagnostic and research applications. There is a general lack of trained staff and a specific lack of Microbial Molecular Epidemiology in the Australian diagnostic and research field. Such skills are valuable and relevant for existing staff and new students in this industry, both external to a degree or as part of a degree. In 2010 a discussion between several microbiologists at James Cook University identified a need for formalised training in Microbial Molecular Epidemiology and Analysis. A short intensive course was suggested as the most efficient use of resources as this also lends itself to involvement by professionals for continuing professional development. We would like to provide a certain number of places in this intensive to professionals to schedule-in an upgrade of their skills without being too expensive on their time. The intensive will be organised so the students and professionals will have to interact and the students, by default, will learn where their skill set can take them. This is a vocationally oriented subject aimed at providing practical training for students, future professionals and current professionals with a microbial research and/or diagnostic focus. The subject introduces the molecular techniques with respect to microbial epidemiology and analysis. It covers both underlying theory and practical application. Areas that the student will be exposed to include quality assurance and measures of error, pipette maintenance, genetic techniques such as nucleic acid extraction, PCR and cloning and computer assisted analytical techniques such as primer design, sequence and SNP analysis, whole genome and next generation sequencing, database searches, testing the validity and robustness of phylogenetic data and identification of markers of microbial pathogenicity and virulence. The examples used in the subject will be from both aquatic and terrestrial disease systems, with students able to select the sample type most closely relating to their field of interest. The course will have been carried out in June 2011 for the first time, utilising graduate students and staff from several schools within the university as well as <b>external</b> <b>personnel.</b> From this we will have received feedback on aspects of the course such as usefulness, comprehensibility and any topics that are not covered that students {{would have liked to have}} worked through.

40|$|Transportation is {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} necessary function, but not as a value-giving process and is therefore sometimes considered a waste. This has led to more industrial companies choose to outsource and to focus on their core competencies. Though, {{there is a growing}} trend of insourcing processes as the outsourcing has not generated the expected results. Since year 1977 Holmen Paper Braviken has outsourced parts of its vessel loading process to NHS. Due to decreasing profitability, Holmen Paper Braviken have gotten more aware of its costs and are now suspecting that the cost of NHS services are too high and that there might be cheaper alternatives. The purpose of this master thesis is to look into if it would be profitable for Holmen Paper to take over NHS work and to carry out the vessel loading themselves. The results shall serve as an economical basis for future negotiations with NHS. Boat transportation stands for a third of all the goods transportations and vessel loading is often conducted twice a week. Braviken {{is in charge of the}} work in the warehouse during vessel loading, whilst NHS is in charge of transporting and loading the paper on the boat. Holmen Paper Braviken pays a stevedoring fee, goods- and harbor dues for NHS services. The stevedoring fee stands for about 62 % of the total cost and is the only fee that is affected by an insourcing decision. If Holmen Paper Braviken were to insource, they would have to invest in new machinery equipment and employ more personnel that can replace NHS resources. The conclusion is that there exists a large savings opportunity if Holmen Paper Braviken would to insource the vessel loading. The increase of capacity that insourcing would bring could improve the work rotation by varying the truck drivers everyday tasks. Insourcing would also give more time to maintenance, which could counteract stone damages on the paper and reduce the wear of the machinery equipment. The increased capacity would though increase the personnel cost, which prolongs the pay- back time for the company to start profiting. With the current circumstances Holmen Paper Braviken is therefore recommended not to insource the vessel loading with own personnel. In order to reduce personnel costs, flexible staffing is required as the utilization rate of full- time staff is low, which results in a high cost per ton. The most profitable alternative is to recruit two full- time truck drivers to Braviken and to hire three truck drivers from Pema. The difficulty with this option is to find extracurricular work for the full- time truck drivers during days without vessel loading, which may reduce overtime at the mill. Therefore, it is less risk to let the <b>external</b> <b>personnel</b> be responsible for the vessel loading, as Holmen Paper Braviken only needs to pay for the labor time during vessel loading. NHS has carried out stevedoring work for many years and holds great skills in dock work, which justifies a continued partnership with NHS. This option provides a relatively short payback time, but will then bring high annual savings for the company. Therefore Holmen Paper Braviken is recommended to invest in new machinery, but to outsource the labor work of vessel loading to NHS. For future research Holmen Paper Braviken should investigate if a capacity increase will reduce overtime costs at the mill. If so, insourcing with full- time employees can be profitable. Another area worth investigating is how a reallocation of capacity for the different transport modes can influence the decision of insourcing. If it is possible to release more capacity for vessel loading, the need of employing new personnel would decrease. Validerat; 20160626 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|Pest and {{diseases}} in agricultural systems reduce the yield {{and quality of}} available food and feed worldwide. To meet the global growing demand for these products, losses should be reduced, preferably in a sustainable way. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable method that aims to minimize economic losses due to pests {{and diseases}}. IPM is generally based on eight steps: 1) prevention, 2) monitoring, 3) Decision‐making based on monitoring and thresholds, 4) use of non‐chemical methods, 5) pesticide selection, 6) reduced pesticide use, 7) anti‐resistance strategies, and 8) evaluation. With these steps, {{it is possible to}} prevent and control pests and diseases whilst deploying pesticides only as a last resort, thus reducing issues with pesticide contamination and resistance. Implementation of IPM by farmers increases when it is clear that it is compatible with existing farm processes and that it results in benefits for them. Successful IPM is most commonly applied against pests and diseases in crop production. When comparing the number of research articles on IPM in crop production with the number of research articles on IPM in animal production, it becomes clear that a paucity of scientific papers have been published on the latter. In laying hen facilities, for example, the application of all but basic IPM is still rare, even though the benefits of IPM have been described for poultry pests and disease vectors. In laying hen facilities Dermanyssus gallinae (PRM=poultry red mite), an hematophagous parasite, is common {{in many parts of the}} world. This mite is hard to control and negatively affects hen health, ‐welfare and farm economics, with estimated costs of infestation reaching 130 million euro per year in Europe. Currently, implementation of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities is limited to some combination of cleaning between flocks, limited preventive measures, and application of chemically or physically acting products. Implementation of more advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae should therefore be considered to improve control prospects for this pest in laying hen facilities.   This thesis focuses on the knowledge necessary for advancing IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. More specifically it focuses on prevention, monitoring and population modelling of this significant pest, with preventive measures and monitoring being key in advancing IPM per se. Knowledge assessment. To develop IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities, biological and ecological knowledge of D. gallinae and knowledge of the effects of biotic and a‐biotic factors on this pests’ population development are required (Chapter 2). Therefore, a seminar was organized with eighteen D. gallinae researchers, from eight different European countries, with the aim of amassing existing expertise. This seminar gave insight into the current knowledge and knowledge gaps, regarding D. gallinae, also informing future perspectives and required developments for improving control of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. During four sessions, the researchers present discussed lifecycle issues, effects of D. gallinae on hen and egg production, monitoring methods for D. gallinae infestations in laying hen facilities and control methods for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. It was concluded that, where the D. gallinae lifecycle is concerned, a lot is still unknown about the mites feeding behaviour and preferences, mating behaviour, survival and conditions required for reproduction, host finding, aggregation cues, and attractant and repellent substances. When focusing on the effects of D. gallinae on the hen and on egg production it was agreed that a D. gallinae infestation is likely to result in higher water intake, lower egg production, lower feed conversion, increase of the immune response and reduced feather quality. It was also suggested that these effects may be hen genotype dependent, and further noted that effects are rarely quantified and need further investigation. Though monitoring was considered to be most important to improve control of D. gallinae, it was concluded that the available monitoring methods only indicate trends and a robust monitoring plan is lacking. The participants considered heating the hen house combined with a chemical treatment to be the most promising control method. Future promising developments for control of D. gallinae were considered to be use of vaccination, predatory mites and entomopathogenic fungi. The effects of D. gallinae on human health were not extensively discussed, but it was concluded that D. gallinae can be of medical significance, either directly via reaction to mite bites, or indirectly via human exposure to the chemicals used to control D. gallinae. Prevention. To acquire knowledge on the routes of introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hens facilities, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system was used (Chapter 3). The structure of this system allows the user to identify the risk factors and the critical control points for the introduction and spread of pathogens and parasites. This method was further used to identify preventive and corrective actions against D. gallinae. Four experts identified 41 hazards for introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. To prevent these hazards, these experts made several suggestions for corrective actions. The risks of 41 hazards were calculated by multiplying the likelihood (1 = occurring seldomly/theoretically; 2 = occurring approximately once a year; 3 = occurring repeatedly/more than once a year) by the severity (1 = low / single place in the facility becomes infested with D. gallinae; 2 = moderate/ facility becomes infested at more than one location; 3 = high/ D. gallinae infestation occurs at almost all places within the laying hen facility) of infestation. Hazards with a risk above 3, or with a severity of 3, were regarded as Critical Control Points (CCP’s). The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for introduction of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities were: introduction of new flocks, containers and crates, the farmer and their employees. The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for spread of D. gallinae between laying hen facilities were mice, rats and flies, wild birds, the feeding system, shared material and equipment, the egg conveyer belt, manure aeration pipes, removal of cadavers, visitors and <b>external</b> <b>personnel,</b> the farmer and their employees. The critical limits, a procedure step of the HACCP system which will be followed by a corrective action when the limit is exceeded, could not be determined as a result of lack of knowledge about thresholds. Subsequently,  suggestions  were made  for monitoring the mite population and for documentation and validation. A checklist was devised using the corrective action from the CCP’s with the highest risks. This management tool for layer farmers was evaluated by UK and Dutch layer farmers as feasible and useful. Monitoring. The approach of Reflexive Interactive Design (RIO) was used to design an automated monitoring tool for D. gallinae, including an automated mite detection sensor (Chapter 6). The approach generated effective and technically feasible solutions for the key functions of the automated mite detection sensor, these being 1) the assessment of the D. gallinae population, 2) localizing the location and assessing the time of detection and 3) removal of mites from the detection area. Three different design concepts were designed using these solutions. As an additional, albeit proven essential step to the RIO approach, the main solutions were tested with live mites ensuring the alignment of solutions with the biology and behaviour of D. gallinae in vivo. A combination of the best solutions were developed in two different prototypes. These prototypes were subsequently tested in the laboratory and on farm. The prototype situated under the perch,  with a through beam sensor and a pump to remove mites from the sensor after recording, was the most successful model. The designed automated mite detection sensor, or automated mite counter, for D. gallinae was subsequently validated in experimental laying hen cages with live birds and a growing population of D. gallinae (Chapter 5). The study resulted in 17 data points, each being a combination of ‘number of mites counted’ by the automated mite counter and the ‘number of mites present’ in the experimental laying hen cages. The regression line between the ‘number of mites counted’ and the ‘number of mites present’ demonstrated that the automated mite counter was able to track the D. gallinae population effectively. Population modelling. Step 2 of IPM describes not only pest monitoring in the field, but also ‘scientifically sound warning, forecasting and early diagnosis systems, where feasible, as well as the use of advice from professionally qualified advisors’. To advance this step for D. gallinae  we  developed  and  demonstrated  an  operational  model,  forecasting  the  mite population dynamics and evaluating and forecasting the effect of a treatment application for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. For IPM this model and the required inputs need to be 1) labour‐extensive with minimal staff input, preferably automatically implementing “real time” measurement   data   into   models;    2)    operational,   providing   easily   interpretable  data, forecasting pest population dynamics and the moment a threshold will be exceeded; 3) able to  compensate  for  different  locations  and  time‐specific‐interactions  and  variables (e. g. management and temperature), enabling the handling of variability of the parameters of interest; 4) able to identify pest hotspots; 5) able to estimate and forecast treatment efficacy; and   6)  applicable  for  different  monitoring  methods  and  therefore  able  to  correct  for monitoring  measurement  errors.  Prior  to  the  development  of  the  population  dynamics model a high variation in population growth was found which could be only partly explained by temperature, flock age, treatment, and compartment/laying hen facility. A substantial part of the total variation remained unexplained, or was found to be temporal. As a result of this   partly  temporal  variation,   a  dynamic  approach  was   suggested  to   improve   the forecasting quality of a population dynamics model. With the input of population monitoring data,   temperature   data   and   information   of   the   dates   of   any   D.  gallinae   treatment interventions, the developed model was able to forecast the population dynamics of D. gallinae post treatment and without treatment while compensating for location and time specific interactions, handling the variability of the parameters. Moreover, this population dynamics model was able to forecast the D. gallinae population using data from different monitoring methods. Together with the models compatibility with different housing systems and its ability to forecast the mite population dynamics (requiring only three relative easy obtainable parameters), this model is an improvement over existing approaches for forecasting D. gallinae that could contribute to steps 2 and 8 of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. The results from this study directly facilitate advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae in laying facilities. The new ‘products’ developed are tools for prevention, monitoring, forecasting population dynamics and evaluating treatment effects, representing the requirements of IPM steps 1, 2, and 8. Indirectly the results may accelerate the development of new control measures, with knowledge acquired through use of the developed products it also is likely to contribute to IPM steps 3, 4, 6 and 8 in the future; e. g. the determination of an action threshold, and a tool advising farmers on the most effective and economic time for applying a corrective action or hotspot treatment for D. gallinae.   With the obtained knowledge and new products implemented to control D. gallinae in laying hen farms, major advances can be made in IPM for this pest. More specifically, as a result of this work IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities can be advanced by the identification of preventative control measures, the development of an automated monitoring tool and a model forecasting mite population dynamics and evaluating applied treatments. Consequently, the results of this study can be expected to improve hen health, welfare and farm economics for the egg production industry. In the future, advances in other IPM programmes can be expected when the obtained knowledge, tools and methods are transferred to other pest species in multiple sectors...|$|E
