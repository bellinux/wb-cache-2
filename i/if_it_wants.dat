[...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is.

2500|$|The LSAT {{light machine}} gun, of the LSAT (Lightweight Small Arms Technologies) program, is a developmental, {{powerful}} {{light machine gun}} (LMG). The purpose {{of the program was}} to develop a lighter, yet very reliable LMG. [...] The program was initiated in 2004, when the Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) challenged the American defence industry to develop a lighter small arms and also design lighter ammunition. [...] The LMG provides a major reduction in weight over legacy weapons, as well as improvements in other areas, such as controllability and reliability. As of 2008, it had two configurations, one that fires cased telescoped ammunition, and one that fires caseless ammunition. [...] After further research and development into both technologies and the guns that fire them, one of the two variants was to be chosen for production. By May 2015, 85,000 cased-telescoped rounds had been fired through 10 test weapons, with testers claiming the weapon had gone as far as it can go until the Army decides <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to make it a program of record.|$|E
2500|$|Groups of {{kangaroos}} {{are called}} mobs. Mobs usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. Living in mobs provides protection {{for some of}} the weaker members of the group. The size and stability of the mobs vary between geographic regions, with eastern Australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west. Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures, comparable to that of ungulates. One common behaviour is nose touching and sniffing, which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group. The kangaroos performing the sniffing gain much information from smell cues. This behaviour enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression. During mutual sniffing, if one kangaroo is smaller, it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver; this is possibly a form of submission. Greetings between males and females are common, with larger males being the most involved in meeting females. Most other non-antagonistic behaviour occurs between mothers and their young. Mother and young reinforce their bond though grooming. A mother will groom her young during or after it is suckling.

2500|$|Big Love {{was also}} studied {{as a part}} of Andrew Atkinson's study of HBO {{programs}} and the post-secular humanistic themes they elicit. In writing of Big Love, Atkinson too draws on the parallel between gay rights and polygamist rights illuminated by the series, but focuses more on the series' influential humanistic elements. In fact, he somewhat rebuffs earlier assertions made: [...] "The attention that is paid to the minute details of Mormon ritual, theology, and historical disputes demonstrates that HBO's writers are uncomfortable with the supposed dichotomy that constructs homosexuality as by default areligious." [...] Atkinson focuses on the ending, interpreting Barb's blessing of Bill as a [...] "ritual innovation [...] indicates that FLDS Mormonism must shed the trappings of patriarchy <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to legitimate polygamy in a post-feminist society", and the fall of Alby, the closet homosexual, as a powerful interpretation of [...] "the future theo-political and sexual tensions that Mormonism, and by extension, the broader American polity, will face as the post-secular matures". In concluding, Atkinson makes the case that Big Love and other HBO shows like The Sopranos, The Wire and Six Feet Under [...] "contribute to a fuller conception of humanity" [...] than other forms of art and entertainment.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Swedish offers {{other ways}} of {{avoiding}} using gender-specific pronouns; e.g., [...] "vederbörande" [...] ("the referred person") and [...] "man" [...] ("one", as in [...] "Man borde..."/"One should...") with its objective form [...] "en" [...] or alternatively [...] "en" [...] as both subjective and objective since [...] "man"/"one" [...] sounds the same as [...] "man"/"male adult" [...] although they are discernible through syntax. [...] "Denne" [...] ("this one") {{may be used to}} refer to a non-gender-specific referent already or soon-to-be mentioned ("Vederbörande kan, om denne så vill,..."/"The referent may, if they wish,..."). One method is rewriting into the plural, as Swedish - like English - has only gender-neutral pronouns in the plural. Another method is writing the pronoun in the referent's grammatical gender ("Barnet får om det vill."/"The child is allowed to, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to." [...] The word [...] "barn" [...] is grammatically neuter, thus the use of the third-person neuter pronoun [...] "det"); some nouns retain their traditional pronouns, e.g., [...] "man"/"man" [...] uses [...] "han"/"he", [...] "kvinna"/"woman" [...] uses [...] "hon"/"she", and [...] "människa"/"human being" [...] uses [...] "hon"/"she".

[...] "Refusing to lay out the grim consequences of premature motherhood, it seems as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to make fans on either end of the political spectrum stick their heads in fiery hampers."

One happens when Deb catches Brooke and Lucas at the drug store buying condoms and whipped cream", said Anzicek. [...] "The second happens in season two when Brooke throws a wedding reception for Nathan and Haley and decorates the room with condoms blown up like balloons." [...] Anzicek said the teenagers, who are only supposed to be sixteen and seventeen at this time, are presented as very sexually-experienced, especially Brooke, and that the one exception is Haley.|$|E
