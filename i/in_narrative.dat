5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris. Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett's historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain, Gilles de Retz. Incidents in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar <b>in</b> <b>narrative</b> and style to the novel, and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.|$|E
5|$|The prose play Edwards Dream (Eduards Traum) was {{released}} in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are apparent in the story. The 1895 story The Butterfly (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent <b>in</b> <b>narrative</b> style compared to Edwards Dream. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Literacy studiesThis {{thesis is}} a study of people’s {{preferences}} towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films, with The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson as the main <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus. The study {{is based on a}} survey {{in the form of a}} questionnaire, three in depth interviews, and different scholars’ theories on the topic. The study includes a sample population of 84 participants, and the answers provided by three interview subjects. 	 The data collected from the survey was carefully analyzed and it presents examples of the participants’ attitudes, habits and engagement patterns towards the experiences of <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films. The interviews are more profound individual investigations of the subjects’ thoughts and personal experiences towards the <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus, and towards <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films in general. The first chapter of this thesis offers an introduction to the thesis as well as an overview of the background of the two <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> focus, including the main plot differences between the two forms of each narrative. The theory chapter provides a presentation of some of the theories different scholars hold towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films, including theories based on empirical studies. This is followed by a methodology section, where the design of the methods, the participants, the procedures and the analysis processes of the studies are presented. The results of this study indicated that in the sample population of the survey, as well as amongst the interview subjects, there was a general preference towards engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels over <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> films However, it was clear that further research needs to be done in order to provide any accurate answers to this issue. On the other hand, the results showed that there was a genuine interest in the engagement in both versions, and that depending on the different aspects of both experiences, there are differences that affect the experiences of the two forms. In the discussion section the results from the studies were discussed in relation to theories by several scholars, including Gerrig’s (1993) theory of being transported. Some central aspects of the discussion are the process of being lost in a book, the different components included when engaging <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> the forms of novels and films, the necessary considerations and challenges met when investigating the experience of different forms of the same narrative, and the emotional and psychological factors which function as motivators towards the engagement <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> novels and films...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue for}} a broad {{education}} <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> {{as a way to}} address several problems found in moral psychology and social cognition.

These discussions also relate directly to theories of empathy with special significance given to situational empathy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} self-representation <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> {{of personal}} language experiences among five Latina immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador living in Los Angeles. Unexpected events <b>in</b> the <b>narratives</b> take the discursive form of reported dialogues between Latinas {{and the people}} they interact with in daily communicative exchanges in different social settings, {{both private and public}} (home, school, hospitals, shopping malls, and nightclubs). Far from being victimized and despite their level of English proficiency (beginner to intermediate), this group of Latinas portrays themselves as intervening in discriminatory situations that jeopardize their language and ethnicity, and as restoring the moral order violated <b>in</b> the <b>narratives.</b> Self-representation <b>in</b> their <b>narratives</b> of language experiences is analyzed through the quotation formula chosen to introduce the reported dialogues together with the most significant prosodic features of the narrative components: unexpected event, response, and attempt (Ochs & Capps, 2001). The degree of discursive agency (De Fina, 2003) exemplified <b>in</b> these <b>narratives</b> shows different strategies of resistance and empowerment among this group of Latinas...|$|R

25|$|The Javanese {{sources are}} very {{selective}} in putting dates to events.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how grammar and reference <b>in</b> journalistic <b>narratives</b> help {{to represent the}} viewpoints of eyewitnesses to shocking criminal acts. Grammatical roles of eyewitnesses and non-eyewitnesses and the expressions referring to them were analyzed <b>in</b> four journalistic <b>narratives</b> about different shocking events and compared to four non-narrative newsreports about the same events. Results show that <b>in</b> the <b>narratives,</b> but not <b>in</b> the newsreports, eyewitnesses appear more often in subject position of a clause than non-eyewitnesses. This indicates that <b>in</b> <b>narratives,</b> journalists choose eyewitnesses as the lens through which they narrate the events. Furthermore, eyewitnesses are more often referred to with pronouns than nouns, whereas non-eyewitnesses are more often referred to with nouns than pronouns. This indicates that eyewitnesses are cognitively highly accessible <b>in</b> news <b>narratives</b> and that their viewpoints are conceptually most proximate to the viewpoints of journalist and reader. It is argued that the strategic use of grammatical roles and referential expressions <b>in</b> journalistic crime <b>narratives</b> puts the reader {{in the position of}} a ‘‘mediated witness’’...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Narrative {{has been}} studied in various disciplines, which {{contributes}} {{to the analysis of}} legal narratives. The paper makes an attempt to understand legal narrative mainly from socio-linguistic and cognitive-linguistic perspectives and argues the constructive nature <b>in</b> legal <b>narratives,</b> and establishes hegemony <b>in</b> legal <b>narratives</b> as convention. Based on case study, the paper contends that spatial manipulation and voice manipulation are employed by court as strategies to create legal hegemony <b>in</b> <b>narratives,</b> and unraveling such strategies helps to deconstruct legal hegemony, which, if employed by a higher court, turns to be another turn of narrative hegemony...|$|R
