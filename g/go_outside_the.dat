5|$|In interrogation, Wexler, {{a former}} Stasi colonel, {{explains}} to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable {{because of its}} utility to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down {{there are hundreds of}} other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.|$|E

The problem can only be solved if the lines <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still {{found it difficult to}} solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.|$|E
25|$|Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animate {{the series}} in {{traditional}} 2-D. The character designs are kept from the web series, with some changed details; such as cleaner lines and brighter eyes. Despite {{the fact that}} both versions use Adobe Flash to create animation, the television episodes are cleaner-looking. This is probably because the characters and backgrounds in the web episodes were made of overlapping JPEG files, and that the television series has an actual budget. Also, the colors still <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> outlines, but it seems more like a second outline than messy drawing. Every building was changed; in the web cartoon most buildings were grey, but was changed to different colors for the TV version. Vendetta's house is now dark green and Charlotte's blue.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} the player character change {{near the end}} of the story, from Phelps to Kelso, McNamara explained that the narrative [...] "got to the point where [...] couldn't really do much more, and you have to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> realm of being a cop to bend the rules". He stated that, when players performed poorly, the game was set to allow them to become a [...] "rogue cop", in which they must defend themselves against other police officers; this feature was removed from the game during development as the team felt that it was [...] "massively out of character".|$|E
500|$|Picard, Worf, and the ship's helmsman, Lieutenant Hawk don EVA {{suits and}} <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise {{to stop the}} Borg from {{converting}} the deflector dish into a beacon to call for reinforcements. [...] During the operation, Hawk is assimilated and shot by Worf as he is attacking Picard. Picard severs the power cable holding the dish to the ship with a single shot from his phaser rifle {{and as soon as}} it is a short distance away Worf fires upon the dish and destroys it. As the Borg continue to assimilate, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward and vows to continue the fight. Sloane confronts the captain and, reminding him of Moby-Dicks Captain Ahab, makes him confront his own irrational behavior. Picard, Crusher and Worf activate the ship's self-destruct mechanism and order the crew to abandon ship, and then Picard apologises to Worf. While the crew evacuate the Enterprise using the escape pods, Picard decides to remain aboard to rescue Data.|$|E

500|$|Director Carl Theodor Dreyer began {{planning}} Vampyr in late 1929, a {{year after}} the release of his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. The production company behind Dreyer's previous film had plans for Dreyer to make another film, but the project was dropped which led to Dreyer deciding to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> studio system to make his next film. Being Dreyer's first sound film, it was made under difficult circumstances as the arrival of sound put the European film industry in turmoil. In France, film studios lagged behind technologically with the first French sound films being shot on sound stages in England. Dreyer went to England to study sound film, where he got together with Danish writer Christen Jul who was living in London at the time. Dreyer decided to create a story based on the supernatural and read over thirty mystery stories and found a number of re-occurring elements including doors opening mysteriously and door handles moving with no one knowing why. Dreyer decided that [...] "We can jolly well make this stuff too". In London and New York, the stage version of Dracula had been a large hit in 1927. Dreyer and Jul created a story based on vampires which Dreyer considered to be [...] "fashionable things at the time". Vampyr is based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's In a Glass Darkly, a collection of five stories first published in 1872. Dreyer draws from two of the stories for Vampyr, one being Carmilla, a vampire story with a lesbian subtext and the other being The Room in the Dragon Volant about a live burial. Dreyer found it difficult to decide on a title for the film. It may have initially been titled Destiny and then Shadows of Hell. When the film was presented in the film journal Close Up it was titled The Strange Adventure of David Gray.|$|E

He opined that [...] "in the context of the internal Government church, the fact that money is being spent to establish that church is the least of your concerns.

2500|$|Clement {{said that}} whether taxpayers would have {{standing}} {{if the government}} hired an outside party to hold the conferences for the Faith Based and Community Initiatives program would be dependent on circumstances. He opined {{that it would be}} likely that a taxpayer would have standing if the program paid for plane tickets for ministers, but when pressed by Scalia clarified that he thought if the funds were coming from the President and [...] "he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not be standing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2015, Buenos Aires is {{the only}} Argentine city with an {{underground}} metro system, nonetheless there is a project to build a system {{in the city of}} CÃ³rdoba (CÃ³rdoba Metro) making it the second underground system in Argentina. The Buenos Aires Underground (SubterrÃ¡neo de Buenos Aires) has currently six lines, each labelled with a letter from A to H, though 3 more lines are planned. [...] A modern tram line (PreMetro) line E2 works as a feeder to Underground Line E at their outer terminus as well as the Urquiza Line for Underground Line B in Chacarita.

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), fire came forth and {{consumed}} the sacrifices on the altar, {{and the people}} shouted and fell on their faces. Acting on their own, Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his fire pan, laid incense on it, and offered alien fire ( [...] , eish zarah), which God had not commanded. And God sent fire to consume them, and they died. Moses told Aaron, [...] "This is what the Lord meant when He said: â€˜Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people,'" [...] and Aaron remained silent. Moses called Aaron's cousins Mishael and Elzaphan to carry away Nadab's and Abihu's bodies to a place outside the camp. Moses instructed Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar not to mourn Nadab and Abihu by rending their garments or leaving their hair unshorn and not to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Tent of Meeting. And God told Aaron {{that he and his}} sons must not drink wine or other intoxicants when they entered the Tent of Meeting, so as to distinguish between the sacred and the profane.|$|E

2500|$|Author Hajime Isayama created Eren to be [...] "an {{ordinary}} youngster {{who gets}} paralyzed with fear {{when he sees}} a titan" [...] rather than a stereotypical hotheaded protagonist often seen in shonen manga. He also stated that Eren's wish to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> city's walls is similar to his own {{when he was a}} child: He lived in a rural Japanese town surrounded by mountains. One day, he wanted to go beyond the mountains, which reflected in the town surrounded by walls in the manga where Eren lived in the series' beginning. The character's Titan form's physique was modeled after middleweight mixed martial artist Yushin Okami. Japanese actor YÅ«ki Kaji commented on how it was important that he should voice Eren's Titan form because he believes it is an extension of the character. He had a meal with Isayama after he visited the recording studio and the manga artist told him he found Eren quite a difficult character but complimented Kaji by saying [...] "You know Eren already", which gave him confidence. Eren's characterization was briefly altered for the English dub of the series making him self-reflective and eloquent in some scenes.|$|E
2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before Guard lock #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to <b>go</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had him sit {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|E
