Shortly after copulation the male tree cricket secretes a fluid from the metanotal gland located between its wings in the thoracic cavity.

Female tree crickets have even been known to steal this fluid from a mating pair during copulation or finish consuming the fluid if the first female dismounts and leaves. After mating a male cannot mate again until after 30 to 60 min allowing the production of another spermatophere (Brown 1997). Eggs are laid <b>in</b> the <b>fall,</b> <b>in</b> a <b>series</b> of small holes drilled into the bark.
