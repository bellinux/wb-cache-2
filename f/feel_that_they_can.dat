This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when they feel like they are becoming too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family experiences can be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted.

5000|$|In a {{study done}} by Fox, Yinon, and Mayraz, {{researchers}} were attempting {{to determine whether or}} not the levels of the false-consensus effect changed in different age groups. In order to come to a conclusion, it was necessary for the researchers to split their participants into four different age groups. Two hundred participants were used, and gender was not considered to be a factor. Just as in the previous study mentioned, this study used a questionnaire as its main source of information. The results showed that the false-consensus effect was extremely prevalent in all groups, but was the most prevalent in the oldest age group (the participants who were labeled as [...] "old-age home residents"). They showed the false-consensus effect in all 12 areas <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were questioned about. The increase in false-consensus effect seen in the oldest age group can be accredited to their high level of [...] "logical" [...] reasoning behind their decisions; the oldest age group has obviously lived the longest, and therefore <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> project their beliefs onto all age groups due to their (seemingly objective) past experiences and wisdom. The younger age groups cannot logically relate to those older to them because they have not had that experience and do not pretend to know these objective truths. These results demonstrate a tendency for older people to rely more heavily on situational attributions (life experience) as opposed to internal attributions.|$|R
40|$|Editorial: Compassion {{requires}} emotional connection, role exchange, empathy, {{experimentation and}} exploration of people’s world views and experiences, their perspectives on what troubles them beyond the illness label, and {{a shift of}} the professional gaze to the person’s location in a social world of relationships and a life-course legacy of risks which include genetics and life events, and current contextual impacts. A remarkable positive consequence is <b>that</b> the practitioner <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> perform their professional role with their full range of skills, and without a conveyor-belt culture of processing and outcome measurement, before and after unthinking intervention. The sense that the system we work in is not socially inclusive, and transmits inequity, as only the most able remain engaged and effective consumers, erodes the ethos of professionals. The skill of exploring the personal biographies and narratives of patients requires flexible and reflexive awareness by professionals of their own histories, and therefore connection with the true self rather than alienation from one’s ethos and values. The notion of smuggling ideas, of commodities, of geopolitical and imperial conquests, of romantic piracy all come together to reveal that smuggling is a pretty ordinary part of the informal economy of organisations and societies (Harvey, 2016). All organisations have creative spaces in which people negotiate and resolve shortages of resources, conflicting interests and avoid scrutiny in order to realise what is not attended to or seen as important in formal economies and structures, alternatively known as System D. Should compassion be relegated to the System D in NHS practice, or health care in any country? Surely not...|$|R
60|$|Where the {{sentiment}} of nationality exists in any force, {{there is a}} primâ facie case for uniting {{all the members of}} the nationality under the same government, and a government to themselves apart. This is merely saying that the question of government ought to be decided by the governed. One hardly knows what any division of the human race should be free to do if not to determine with which of the various collective bodies of human beings they choose to associate themselves. But, when a people are ripe for free institutions, there is a still more vital consideration. Free institutions are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities. Among a people without fellow-feeling, especially if they read and speak different languages, the united public opinion necessary to the working of representative government can not exist. The influences which form opinions and decide political acts are different in the different sections of the country. An altogether different set of leaders have the confidence of one part of the country and of another. The same books, newspapers, pamphlets, speeches, do not reach them. One section does not know what opinions or what instigations are circulating in another. The same incidents, the same acts, the same system of government, affect them in different ways, and each fears more injury to itself from the other nationalities than from the common arbiter, the state. Their mutual antipathies are generally much stronger than jealousy of the government. That any one of them feels aggrieved by the policy of the common ruler is sufficient to determine another to support that policy. Even if all are aggrieved, none <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> rely on the others for fidelity in a joint resistance; the strength of none is sufficient to resist alone, and each may reasonably think that it consults its own advantage most by bidding for the favor of the government against the rest. Above all, the grand and only reliable security in the last resort against the despotism of the government is in that case wanting--the sympathy of the army with the people. The military are the part of every community in whom, from the nature of the case, the distinction between their fellow-countrymen and foreigners is the deepest and strongest. To the rest of the people foreigners are merely strangers; to the soldier, they are men against whom he may be called, at a week's notice, to fight for life or death. The difference to him is that between friends and enemies--we may almost say between fellow-men and another kind of animals; for, as respects the enemy, the only law is that of force, and the only mitigation the same as in the case of other animals--that of simple humanity. Soldiers to whose feelings half or three fourths of the subjects of the same government are foreigners will have no more scruple in mowing them down, and no more desire to ask the reason why, than they would have in doing the same thing against declared enemies. An army composed of various nationalities has no other patriotism than devotion to the flag. Such armies have been the executioners of liberty through the whole duration of modern history. The sole bond which holds them together is their officers and the government which they serve, and their only idea, if they have any, of public duty, is obedience to orders. A government thus supported, by keeping its Hungarian regiments in Italy and its Italian in Hungary, can long continue to rule in both places with the iron rod of foreign conquerors.|$|E

40|$|The {{democratic}} {{conditions in}} national states have change radically {{at the same}} time as the society has changed. Because of social and economic globalization processes, the states and government has lost power for the benefit of transnational and global institutions. That affects the democracy since the nation state earlier defined the domain of citizenship. At the same time, citizens’ confidence towards political parties and politicians has gone down. These trends have lead to a situation that is spoken about as the crisis of democracy. The globalization has however also created new possibilities for political arenas and way to be politically organized. This thesis is about democracy; about being able to influence one’s own situation and the society one live in. It’s also about the protracted struggle between different groups to be able to do this. This field is very wide and the possible ways to examine it are endless, but the part that will be in focus here is the municipality of Norrköping. It will be about how the municipality, trough the Committee of Democracy, which is appointed by the municipal council, works with democracy, but also about how young people in Norrköping <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> influence and effect.

[...] He closes with a sort of disclaimer, “if anyone thinks this too harsh, let him remember that rebellion is intolerable and that the destruction of the world is to be expected every hour”. One of the reasons why Luther urged that the secular authorities crush the peasant rebellion was because of St. Paul's teaching of the doctrine of Divine Right of Kings in his epistle to the , which says that all the authorities are appointed by God, and should not therefore be resisted.|$|R
