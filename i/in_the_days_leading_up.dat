He was also required to undergo physiotherapy. BAR had their official test driver Darren Manning available to replace Villeneuve should the need arise.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} game, Georgia Tech had the 11th best rushing defense in FBS football. That defense was led {{statistically}} by linebacker Philip Wheeler, {{considered by many}} to be one of the nation's best blitzing linebackers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the championship game, Wheeler was named to the Rivals.com All-America team.

5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard {{came to believe that}} these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the race, Secretariat {{was seen}} as the {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

5|$|Race {{officials}} {{expected a}} record turnout <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the Preakness, estimating over 50,000 people. They {{hoped that the}} possibility of Secretariat completing the Triple Crown and Sham attempting to foil Secretariat's run would lead to an increase in attendance. The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.|$|E

Ralf Schumacher {{said that he would}} decide after the event's first free practice sessions whether he would compete.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{body was}} {{returned}} to Glasgow, where his funeral took place on 13 September 1985. In later years {{it was revealed that}} it was not a heart attack, but rather pulmonary oedema (fluid in the lungs) as a result of heart disease that caused Stein's death. Stein had stopped taking the diuretic medication prescribed for this <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the game, which has been suggested as a contributory factor to his eventual collapse.|$|E

5|$|The {{final month}} of the war offered little respite to the battalion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November. On {{the day of the}} Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
5|$|During the 2002 season, Air Force {{allowed an}} average of 360.7yards per game, fourth in the Mountain West and 57th nationally. This was an {{improvement}} over the 2001 season, when the Falcons allowed 452.7yards per game on average. Air Force also was allowing far fewer points per game. In 2002, the Falcons allowed {{an average of}} 23.6points per game, down from more than 32per game in 2001. Air Force was successful in its kicking defense as well. Between 1990 and 2002, Air Force ranked second in terms of blocked kicks with 79. Virginia Tech was first, with 85. Air Force strong safety Mark Marsh was pronounced doubtful for the game due to a lower leg injury he suffered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the San Francisco Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During the war about 6,000 {{people lived}} in Bình Giã, and {{most of whom were}} staunchly anti-communist. The {{inhabitants}} of Bình Giã were Roman Catholic refugees who had fled from North Vietnam in 1954 during Operation Passage to Freedom because of fears of Communist persecution. To prepare for their main battle, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment was ordered to block Inter-provincial Road No. 2 and 15, and destroy any South Vietnamese units attempting to reach Bình Giã from the south-western flank of the battlefield. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the battle, the Viet Cong often came out to harass the local militia forces. On December 9, 1964, the 272nd Regiment destroyed an entire South Vietnamese mechanised rifle company along Inter-provincial Road No. 2, destroying 16 M-113 APCs. On December 17, the 272nd Regiment destroyed another six armoured vehicles on Inter-provincial Road No. 15.|$|E

5|$|In March 1975 the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) 4th Corps {{staged a}} {{large-scale}} offensive, known as Campaign 275, {{with the aim}} of capturing the Central Highlands from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in order to kick-start the first stage of the 1975 Spring Offensive. Within ten days, the North Vietnamese destroyed most South Vietnamese military formations in II Corps Tactical Zone, exposing the severe weaknesses of the South Vietnamese Army. For South Vietnam, the defeat at Ban Me Thuot and the disastrous evacuation from the Central Highlands came about as a result of two major mistakes. Firstly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the assault on Ban Me Thuot, ARVN Major General Pham Van Phu repeatedly ignored intelligence which showed the presence of several North Vietnamese combat divisions around the district. Secondly, President Nguyen Van Thieu's strategy to withdraw from the Central Highlands was poorly planned and implemented.|$|E
5|$|In the Sixth Round {{they faced}} Third Division South club Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, as 8,000 Vale fans {{made up a}} 31,000 crowd. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the game thieves had stolen 1,200 matchday tickets and police were {{vigilant}} to catch out anyone who tried to enter the stadium with these stolen tickets. The only goal of the game came from Leake – who struck {{the ball into the}} net after controlling the ball from a Hayward knock-down from an Askey corner – put Vale into the semi-finals, with the team 'delightedly mobbed' by supporters after the finish. Ray King {{made a name for himself}} in the dying moments of the game after making a save from a George Poulton shot.|$|E
5|$|More of {{a concern}} to Dracula's planners, however, were the {{land-based}} threats to the landing craft carrying the assault troops of 26th Indian Division. Air support was deemed to be vital to the operation's success, {{and a number of}} Japanese airfields around Toungoo were captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to Dracula. There was also the problem of the defences in and around the River Rangoon, up which the landing craft were to sail. The river itself was heavily mined, a result of Japanese defensive measures as well as RAF offensive operations earlier in the conflict, and {{it would have to be}} swept and cleared of mines before any amphibious assault could take place. Before this could occur, however, the coastal defences along the banks of the river would have to be neutralized; a particular worry was the presence of an artillery battery at Elephant Point on the west bank of the river. The geography of the area ensured that the battery could not be destroyed through artillery bombardment or airstrikes, and weather conditions precluded an early amphibious assault. As such, it was decided that a day before Dracula began on 2 May, a parachute battalion would be dropped near Elephant Point with the task of assaulting and destroying the battery.|$|E

50|$|His nephew Georgios Rallis {{has criticized}} him for two, in his opinion, {{important}} mistakes. Namely because <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> to <b>the</b> 1897 war {{he did not}} oppose sending the Hellenic army to Crete and that led to Greece's involvement and eventual defeat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing war. The second mistake according to Rallis was Theotokis' refusal to mediate between Prince George of Greece and Eleftherios Venizelos during their disagreement, an event that eventually grew to become the National Schism.|$|R
5|$|The {{outpost of}} Ngok Tavak was manned by the 11th Mobile Strike Force Company since March 1968. Earlier in the year, Company C, 5th Special Forces Group in Đà Nẵng {{came up with}} a plan to {{supplement}} the intelligence agencies in the Khâm Đức area, by deploying a Mike Force Company to operate south of the Special Forces Camp; subsequently, the 11th MSF Company was selected for the task. The unit was led by three members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV): Captain John White and Warrant Officers Frank Lucas and Don Cameron. The Australian-led unit included eight U.S. Special Forces and 173 South Vietnamese and Nùng CIDG soldiers, and they were joined by 33 U.S. Marines on 4 May. Since their arrival, White and his men had set up camp on top of the hill feature in Ngok Tavak. They also made improvements to the camp's defensive perimeter, which included an old minefield left by the French. Despite their preparations, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the battle, the unit was plagued by a number of problems with their defense.|$|E
