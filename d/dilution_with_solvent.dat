40|$|Theory is {{presented}} {{relating to the}} reversible interaction of an f-valent acceptor, A, with a bivalent ligand, B, {{which leads to the}} formation of a series of complexes comprising networks of alternating A and B molecules. An explicit expression is derived for the overall extent of reaction in terms of the total molar concentrations of reactants (m and m), the valency of the acceptor and the site-binding constant, k, governing the equilibria. It is shown by differentiation of this expression holding m (or m) fixed that relations are available for the independent evaluation of f and k from a combination of precipitin and radioimmunoassay experiments. Moreover, it is established that <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> (m/m fixed) cannot lead to the appearance of a precipitate with this type of crosslinking system. The latter observation forms the background for the development of theory pertaining to the joint operation of ligand dimerization, 2 B⇌B, and crosslinking of the multivalent acceptor with bivalent B. The theoretical examination of this system is developed in terms of site-probability functions and involves the delineation of unique solutions for the extent of crosslinking reaction aided by the definition of the extent of binding in defined limits. It is shown with the use of numerical examples that the system involving self-associating ligand may result in the appearance of a precipitate on <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> and the conditions for the operation of this phenomenon are elucidated. It is noted that other types of ligand self-interaction may lead to similar effects in crosslinking systems, and the general principles emerging from this study are discussed in terms of systems in which antibody ligands are known to be involved in association reactions or are suspected to be so involved on the basis of precipitation effects observed on <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> <b>solvent...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{vibrational}} dephasing of the 656 /cm mode (nu 1, a 1 g) of CS 2 and the 991 /cm mode (nu 2, a 1 g) of benzene {{have been}} studied {{as a function of}} concentration in mixtures with a number of solvents using a ps time-resolved CARS technique. This technique employs two tunable synchronously-pumped mode-locked dye lasers in a stimulated Raman pump, coherent anti-Stokes Raman probe time-resolved experiment. Results are obtained for CS 2 in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, nitrobenzene, and ethanol and for benzene nu 2 in CS 2. The dephasing rates of CS 2 nu 1 increase on <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> the polar <b>solvents</b> and decrease or remain constant on <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> the nonpolar <b>solvents.</b> The CS 2 /benzene solutions show a contrasting behavior, with the CS 2 nu 1 dephasing rate being nearly independent of concentration whereas the benzene nu 2 dephasing rate decreases on dilution.

40|$|Many highly {{exothermic}} gas-liquid {{reactions are}} carried out <b>with</b> a vaporizing <b>solvent,</b> which after condensation is returned to the reactor. In this way the liberated reaction heat for a large part is absorbed by the cooling water flowing through the condenser.

The temperature dependence of the enhancement factor is strongly affected by the solvent evaporation. The influence of several design and operation parameters such as liquid residen time, <b>dilution</b> of reactant <b>with</b> <b>solvent,</b> air excess in the gas phase and reactor pressure on the conversion and the reactor pressure is demonstrated.

50|$|As peroxo compound, TBPB {{contains}} about 8.16 wt% of active oxygen {{and has a}} self accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT) of about 60 °C. The SADT is the lowest temperature at which self-accelerating decomposition in the transport packaging can occur within a week, and which should not be exceeded while storage or transportation. TBPB should therefore be stored between minimum 10 °C (below solidification) and maximum 50 °C. <b>Dilution</b> <b>with</b> a high-boiling <b>solvent</b> increases the SADT. The half-life of TBPB, in which 50% of the peroxy ester is decomposed, is 10 hours at 104 °C, one hour at 124 °C and one minute at 165 °C. Amines, metal ions, strong acids and bases, as well as strong reducing and oxidizing agents accelerate the decomposition of TBPB even in low concentrations. However, TBPB {{is one of the}} safest peresters or organic peroxides in handling. The main decomposition products of tert-butyl peroxybenzoate are carbon dioxide, acetone, methane, tert-butanol, benzoic acid and benzene.|$|R
40|$|Diffusive (passive) {{samplers}} of {{all kinds}} fulfil many of the logistical requirements of an ideal ambient air monitor. They are low cost, easy to distribute/use, suitable {{for a wide range}} of common volatile organic air pollutants, reliable, applicable to long-term sampling and do not require power. Several different kinds of diffusive sampler have been developed for VOCs. These were predominantly designed for occupational hygiene work and most require solvent extraction prior to GC analysis. The analyte <b>dilution</b> necessary <b>with</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction has been found to limit sensitivity and to preclude general application to ambient air assessment. A tube-form, sorbent-based diffusive monitor, specifically designed to minimise the air speed limitations of conventional badge-type diffusive samplers and to be compatible with analysis by thermal desorption-GC, was first reported in 1979. In common with other diffusive samplers for VOCs, this device was initially developed for use as a personal monitor for occupational hygiene measurements. However, several recent reports have demonstrated that it can also be applied to the measurement of low concentration VOCs in indoor and outdoor ambient air. This paper reviews the reported experiences of indoor and outdoor air monitoring using a tube-form diffusive monitor. Specific attention is paid to general sampling/analytical procedures, concentration/detection limits, applicable analyte ranges, minimising artefacts, quality assurance and method limitations. Practical recommendations regarding sampling and analytical parameters are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{dielectric}} {{spectra of}} mixtures {{of the polar}} solute isoamyl bromide in 2 -methylpentane have been investigated in the frequency range 1 mHz to 1 MHz and in the temperature range approaching the glass transition temperature. The results obtained from the spectra are compared with those obtained recently [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 10979 (1999) ] on pure isoamyl bromide. It is found that on increasing <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> the nonpolar <b>solvent,</b> {{the width of the}} curves of the dielectric spectra increase significantly, and this is reflected in the increase in the nonexponential nature of the relaxation dynamics. This is found to be a consequence of the decrease in the cooperativity of the relaxation dynamics and or an increase in the heterogeneity of the solution. The data are found to fit the Havriliak?Negami equation extremely well. The data at low and high frequencies also fits the "universal law," since the latter is a low and high frequencies limiting case of the Havriliak?Negami equation. The scaling parameters of this law are calculated for the 25 mol % solution of isoamyl bromide in 2 -methylpentane, and these are shown to experimentally relate to the H?N parameters. The stretched exponential parameter,, is estimated {{as a function of the}} temperature and is shown to follow the equation a(T?T 0). Vogel?Fulcher?Tammann equation fits the data of the relaxation peak frequency as a function of the inverse of absolute temperature for the various mixtures quite well, this being possibly a consequence of the temperature dependence of the stretched exponential parameter. The predictions from the mode coupling theory and those by Bertrand and Souletie are verified with the exception that the exponent is found to be much greater than predicted by these theories.

The use of emulsified standards was compared to aqueous standards for the calibration of an emulsified used lubricating oil sample. The traditionally used methods of ashing in a muffle furnace and <b>dilution</b> <b>with</b> the organic <b>solvent,</b> xylene were also evaluated {{in comparison with the}} emulsion methodology. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used for the wear-metal-in-oil analysis. The performance characteristics of each method were compared for the following metals: AI, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb. The used oil sample and emulsified standards were acid treated and emulsified in water { 1 % wlw) using tetralin as solvent and triton X- 100 as surfactant. This evaluation included the calibration characteristics, precision and accuracy obtained, as well as the results of recovery studies. The emulsification method was found to be comparable to the ashing and dilution methods in terms of calibration and only Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb concentrations were found. The precision of the emulsification method was found, in general, to be close to or less than 2 % RSD. The used oil matrix also contained leaked petroleum from a problem car engine. An accurate determination of lead was consequently impossible since the high lead content led to sedimentation. The use of the internal standard, indium, was evaluated for its effectiveness in correcting possible matrix effects that were evident from the results obtained in the recovery studies. The recovery studies showed the Cr and Pb determinations to be adversely affected by internal standardization. An alternative approach for matrix effect correction, the common analyte internal standardization (CAIS) method was also investigated. This method held promise for allowing the use of aqueous standards, instead of oil or emulsion standards, for the calibration of the emulsified oil samples.
