From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and <b>fixed</b> <b>seating.</b> The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end.

If a party has received more <b>fixed</b> <b>seats</b> than its share of the total 349-seat distribution, district seats allocated to that party are retracted and given to the party with the second 'highest quotient'. The parties are then awarded a number of adjustment seats sufficient to cover the gap between their amount of <b>fixed</b> <b>seats</b> and their share in the nationwide distribution.|$|R

25|$|The stadium, First Tennessee Park, {{was built}} on the former site of Sulphur Dell and {{replaced}} Herschel Greer Stadium, the Sounds' home ballpark since 1978. The stadium holds up to 10,000people, with 8,500 of that in <b>fixed</b> <b>seating</b> and the rest in open areas, such as a grass berm. The cost of the entire development, including commercial and retail space, a greenway, and a parking garage, is approximately $150million; the stadium itself costs $47million. The new stadium opened on April 17, 2015. In the ballpark's inaugural game, the Sounds defeated the visiting Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of the pavilion created a legal controversy, given that there are historic limitations on the height of buildings in Grant Park. To avoid these legal restrictions, the city classifies the bandshell {{as a work of}} art rather than a building. With several design and assembly problems, the construction plans were revised over time, with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow. In the end, the performance venue was designed with a large <b>fixed</b> <b>seating</b> area, a Great Lawn, a trellis network to support the sound system and a signature Gehry stainless steel headdress. It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor concert hall sound experience. The pavilion and Millennium Park have received recognition by critics, particularly for their accessibility; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as [...] "one of the most accessible parks– not just in the United States but possibly the world".|$|E

500|$|The Sounds' current home {{ballpark}} is First Tennessee Park, {{which opened}} on April 17, 2015. It {{is located in}} downtown Nashville {{at the location of}} the former Sulphur Dell ballpark. The $91million stadium has a <b>fixed</b> <b>seating</b> capacity of 8,500people, but can accommodate up to 10,000people with additional grass berm seating. The ballpark's attendance record was set on July 3, 2017, when 11,764people watched the Sounds play against the Oklahoma City Dodgers {{on the night of the}} team's Independence Day celebration. The stadium features wide concourses with direct views of the playing field. Its design, which incorporates the use of musical and baseball imagery, is meant to connect the park with the city's baseball and musical heritage. This is accomplished through the use of directional signage displaying information on Nashville's former teams and players, the grandstand's light stanchions reminiscent of those found at Sulphur Dell, and the use of the team's guitar pick logo throughout the park.|$|E
