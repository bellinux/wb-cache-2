According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization – the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation – centrally nominated local authority, (iii) Devolution – transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) <b>Deconcentration</b> – the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government.|$|E

50|$|The term “deconcentration of attention” was {{introduced}} by Oleg Bakhtiyarov {{on the basis of}} research performed in the 1980s at the Kiev Institute of Psychology, USSR. <b>Deconcentration</b> of attention was originally developed “… as part of training programs for operators in the complex, uncertain, and extreme conditions”.|$|E

50|$|Industrial <b>deconcentration</b> is the {{movement}} of industrial zones (factories) away {{from the center of}} the city, and further away from each other.

50|$|In some of {{his later}} studies, he focused on local {{government}} reforms and the futility of centralized planning in Nigeria. Local government reforms or decentralization {{is one of the}} most prominent views held by western analysts and Africans scholars as a necessary instrument to build a solid democratic foundation. Also, since 1922, with the conduct of legislative elections in colonial Nigeria that included native citizens, nationalists who are believed to be more successful than nation builders, advocated democratic norms and decentralization against the autocratic systems of colonialism. Since then until 1960, there was a concerted effort to build decentralization into the administrative system, this came to an end with the coming of independence in 1960. Adamolekun views on local government and decentralization in the post-independence period is one of <b>deconcentration</b> of power in the local government of many African societies. <b>Deconcentration</b> is a scenario when only responsibility or authority is transferred, but not resources or local accountability. This is in Contrast to devolution, when there is transfer, by law and other formal actions, of responsibility, resources, and accountability, the system of devolution is believed to be necessary for good governance in local administration. The scenario also led to the flight of top officials who won elections at the local level but seeing the feeble authority in local governance, subsequently left to join the state or federal executive level.He also considers as fundamentally weak, top level political and administrative management, which contributed to the failure of government planning. He asserted a lack of imbalance with a connection that both political and administrative leaders share a certain level of weakness. In contrast to popular belief of political weakness and administrative effectiveness. He also sees continuity in the midst of constant regime changes in contrast to perceived belief that regime changes can bring improvement in administrative structures or to the civil service.|$|E
50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the trunk link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to trunk circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of <b>deconcentration</b> eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of shrinking cities generally {{refers to a}} metropolitan area that experiences significant population loss {{in a short period}} of time. The theory is also known as counterurbanization, metropolitan <b>deconcentration,</b> and metropolitan turnaround. It was popularized in reference to Eastern Europe post-socialism, when old industrial regions came under Western privatization and capitalism. Shrinking cities in the United States, on the other hand, has been forming since 2006 in dense urban centers while external suburban areas continue to grow. Suburbanization in tandem with deindustrialization, human migration, and the 2008 Great Recession all contribute to origins of shrinking cities in the U.S. Scholars estimate that one in six to one in four cities worldwide are shrinking in countries with expanding economies and those with deindustrialization. However, there are some issues with the concept of shrinking cities, as it seeks to group together areas that undergo depopulation for a variety of complex reasons. These may include an aging population, shifting industries, intentional shrinkage to improve quality of life, or a transitional phase, all of which require different responses and plans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} {{of the city was}} from a very early time in the hands of four Burgomasters (Burgemeesters in Dutch, but better translated to English as [...] "mayors"), largely {{for the same reason that}} Rome had two consuls: <b>deconcentration</b> of power. Originally, the burgomasters were appointed by the lord or the province, the Count of Holland and their successors, the Duke of Burgundy. As the Burgundian Dukes tended to have national interests to occupy them, the appointments were often left to their stadtholders. From the 15th century on, however, their election was by a complex system. An electoral college was formed yearly, made up of the outgoing burgomasters, the alderman (City Councilmen), and all those who in the past had held the post of burgomaster or alderman. The burgomasters are chosen by simple majority. In the second stage of the election, the three newly elected burgomasters [...] "co-opted" [...] (chose) one of the outgoing four to stay on for a second one-year term. This way, one of the burgomasters stayed in office two years to provide continuity.|$|E

In 2000, the World Bank report reveals that local government knows the needs and desires of their constituents better than the national government, while at the same time, it is easier to hold local leaders accountable. From the study of West African tropical forest, it is argued that the downwardly accountable and/or representative authorities with meaningful discretional powers are the basic institutional element of decentralization that should lead to efficiency, development and equity. This collaborates with the World Bank report in 2000 which says that decentralization should improve resource allocation, efficiency, accountability and equity [...] "by linking the cost and benefit of local services more closely".|$|E
50|$|From late 1947, U.S. {{priorities}} {{shifted to}} internal political stability and economic growth. Economic <b>deconcentration,</b> for example, was left uncompleted as GHQ responded to new imperatives. American authorities encouraged business practices and industrial {{policies that have}} since become sources of contention between Japan and its major trade partners, notably the United States. During the Occupation, GHQ/SCAP mostly abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry. Along with the later American change of heart, and {{due in part to}} the need for an economically stronger Japan in the face of a perceived Soviet threat, these economic reforms were also hampered by the wealthy and influential Japanese who stood to lose a great deal. As such, there were those who consequently resisted any attempts at reform, claiming that the zaibatsu were required for Japan to compete internationally, and looser industrial groupings known as keiretsu evolved. A major land reform was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of General Douglas MacArthur's SCAP staff. However, Ladejinsky has stated that the real architect of reform was Hiro Wada, former Japanese Minister of Agriculture. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately 5800000 acre of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) were purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program and resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. diplomat James Dobbins {{writes that}} an early draft of JCS 1067 {{had been written}} while the plan was still {{understood}} to be U.S. policy, and [...] "because nothing replaced the Morgenthau plan once it had been disavowed, {{the final version of}} JCS 1067 contained many of the harsh measures and all the intent of a hard peace toward Germany". However, according to Dobbin, in May 1945 - shortly after its approval in April 1945 - the newly appointed deputy military governor, General Clay, implied that the directive was unworkable and initially wanted it to be revised; after the deliberate loopholes were pointed out to him, General Clay did not press further for a revision but [...] "took great liberties in interpreting and implementing JCS 1067". Clay's good-willed effort did meet obstacles, like General Marshall forbidding him from relax the strict non-fraternization to a more reasonable level. Dobbins remarks that the harsh punitive measures shifted toward reform over time as the US faced with the problem of feeding millions of Germans and the Soviet expansion. [...] mentions that the American military government was, until 1947, operating under JCS 1067, which he describes as [...] "a framework that had its origin in the Morgenthau Plan". also mentions that [...] "As far as I know the results the revisionist debate, it seems to me that, although plans for a policy concerning post-war Germany had been developed as early as 1941, no plan had been adopted by the president that could have served as a basis for a purposeful policy. This resulted in the German question being postponed to after the final victory over the Axis Powers and Japan. At most, the short-lived approval of the Morgenthau Plan by Roosevelt might possibly be seen as a guiding principle of his policy toward Germany, especially since important elements of this plan found their way into 1067." [...] talks of the policy of [...] "Never again a strong Germany!" [...] that found its expression in the famous JCS 1067 (which was influenced by the Morgenthau Plan), but this principle was abandoned by the USA soon after the Potsdam Conference, though it was not until 1947 that JSC 1067 was replaced by JSC 1779 and its related [...] "European Recovery Program". [...] Kindleberger states that [...] "With the termination of hostilities, the mood of suppression gave way to ambivalence - in the West. Germany needed to be punished for wrongdoing, but it was also essential to revive the German economy for its necessary contribution to European recovery. The stern pronouncement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive (JCS 1067) that the United States commander should do nothing to restore the German economy above the minimum level necessary to prevent such disease and unrest as might endanger the occupation forces gave way in July 1945 to an order to stimulate coal production for export delivery to Belgium, the Netherlands, and France" [...] (which did not materialize). In May 1946, General Clay's stop-order on the dismantling of plants (for reparations) marked the first open recognition of the failure of Potsdam. After 1947, when conflicting policies began to be reconciled, economic and social conditions began to be improved.Henry Burke Wend refers to JCS 1067, as approved on 14 May 1945, as a compromise document which, [...] "together with Truman's ascension to the presidency 12 April 1945, spelled the demise of the Morgenthau Plan". Despite this, [...] "denazification, <b>deconcentration</b> and dismantling had a profound, if varied, impact on German industrial recovery." [...] Even with the introduction of the Marshall Plan, self-defeating policies that simultaneously industrialised Germany (by investing billions of dollars) and deindustrialised it (through heavy dismantling of its industry) continued until 1948-1949.Walter M. Hudson describes JSC 1067 as less harsh than Morgenthau's plan: while core elements of the Morgenthau Plan were incorporated in JCS 1067, it was deliberately diluted, and permitted the military government to be more flexible than envisaged by the Morgenthau Plan.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the processes of}} economic <b>deconcentration</b> {{that have occurred in}} Europe during the last fifteen years. Attention is particularly paid to fourteen case studies carried out in metropolitan areas in the Czech Republic (Prague and Brno), Denmark (Copenhagen and Aarhus), Israel (Tel Aviv and Beer-Sheva), Italy (Rome and Chieti-Pescara), the Netherlands (North Wing of Randstad and Breda), Spain (Madrid and Valladolid) and the United Kingdom (Bristol and Southampton). The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish a taxonomy of the forms of <b>deconcentration</b> in the studied metropolitan areas. The majority of the fourteen case study areas present a <b>deconcentration</b> process that concerns certain specific territories of the metropolitan areas.

A dispersed <b>deconcentration</b> can be seen in the United Kingdom (Bristol and Southampton) and in the Italian and Spanish capital cities (Rome and Madrid). When the sectoral composition of <b>deconcentration</b> is analysed, there are three different possibilities: In the cities studied, a prevalence in the <b>deconcentration</b> of Services (in Copenhagen, Aarhus, North Wing of Randstad, Breda, Bristol, Southampton and Madrid) can be seen, followed by retailing (in Prague, Brno, Chieti-Pescara and Tel Aviv) and lastly by industry (in Valladolid, Rome and Beer-Sheva). A European model of <b>deconcentration</b> has the peculiarity of being very diversified. The historical wealth of the European cities is, in itself, a strong element of diversity. In some cases, due to its high value, cultural heritage constitutes an element of centripetal attraction and serves to slacken <b>deconcentration.</b> In other contexts, this same heritage favours centrifugal forces and enhances the <b>deconcentration</b> of space-consuming activities that, by their own intrinsic nature, must be located close to transport infrastructures...|$|E
