This report {{presents the results of}} the in depth evaluation of 14 SEAPs from CoM East countries, aimed at identifying good practices, but also weaknesses and challenges. The analysis has generally revealed a good compliance with the key commitments, in terms of definition of the target by 2020, calculation of the emission inventory, and definition of actions in the key sectors of activity. Aspects related to governance (e. g. the adaptation of administrative structures, the mobilisation of civil society, or the SEAP monitoring process) and to the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> are often described in general terms, without presenting tailor-made strategies.

40|$|The Rules of Professional Conduct impose various {{restrictions}} {{relating to}} attorney fees and {{the payment of}} litigation costs, which are designed to preserve the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role as a zealous but objective advocate. Class actions stand apart from other kinds of litigation {{in that they are}} designed to promote efficiency by their combining like claims into single actions, and individual justice by their vindicating claims that if taken individually might not be economically viable. In light of these special concerns, the courts have carved out several exceptions to ordinary attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees, litigation expense, and disbursement rules that they routinely apply to class action cases. These special allowances include special compensation for class representatives, additional recovery for expert plaintiffs, and up-front payments of litigation costs by attorneys. While, as some courts have recognized, innovations in the class action context create some ethical risks, this should not lead courts to sound the death knell for creative <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> class <b>action</b> litigation.

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{endeavors to}} address the issue of global justice in climate finance from an angle which is generally overlooked – except as regards the REDD+ regime –, that of the communities which bear the social and environmental adverse impacts of mitigation and adaptation projects financed by international climate funds. Although political attention has to date been mainly focused on the amount of funds raised, qualitative issues show the daunting task that lies ahead: without transparency of and accountability in climate finance, fragmented and “unmonitorable” climate finance implies the risk of duplicated efforts and ineffectiveness, and increases the social and environmental risks associated with the mitigation or adaptation projects. From a global justice point of view, fastening climate finance to other issues they trigger means inter alia that the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> climate <b>actions</b> must be brought back into the wider context of sustainable development and good governance. Within the framework of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) an Independent Redress Mechanism is being created that will allow the people affected by the projects the GCF funds to hold the GCF accountable for having given the green lights to a project, either public or private, in violation with the GCF’s social and environmental safeguards. Through this example, this contribution offers to highlight what challenges still remain to be dealt with to re-integrate climate finance into the whole of the climate regime complex...|$|R

Second, the logistical costs related to the coverage and quality of physical infrastructure and lack of regulatory harmonization pose a serious constraint to regional integration and global competitiveness.

40|$|How {{stable and}} {{resilient}} is the euro area’s Banking Union? The answer {{depends on the}} fundamentals of the euro area’s financial sector as much as on the Banking Union’s novel institutional and normative framework. The prospects for financial stability are thus contingent {{on the evolution of}} banks’ portfolios, conditions of operation and industrial structure, as reshaped by the crisis (section 1). In particular, the degree of integration of financial markets and banking systems is a key factor: continuing fragmentation is bound to have negative implications also in terms of resilience (section 2). Turning to public prudential regulation and crisis management, the establishment, as part of the Banking Union project, of streamlined decision-making mechanisms for the supervision and resolution of banks may not be enough; coherent and credible arrangements for the <b>financing</b> <b>of</b> resolution <b>actions</b> and, more generally, for the provision of a uniform and effective safety net are also needed. With a convincing and equitable set of burden-sharing arrangements, a future financial shock would be less destabilizing and a relapse to conditions of market fragmentation could be avoided (section 3). It should be noted, however, that a proper appreciation of the situation regarding the safety net should take explicitly into account the close interactions between banking regulation and monetary policy. From this perspective, the ultimate question is, whether the Banking Union can provide simultaneously effective stabilization mechanisms and robust market discipline, through unwaveringly strict enforcement of prudential standards and banks’ budgetary constraints (section 4) ...|$|R
