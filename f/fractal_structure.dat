These cords are often associated with stems and rhizomes of the common nettle (Urtica dioica). These mycelial systems' development and the species's interactions with other cord-forming wood decomposer basidiomycetes have been investigated. The mycelia of Stropharia caerulea form a <b>fractal</b> <b>structure</b> characterized by a dense, relatively slowly extending front, a formation associated with finding relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients–equivalent to short-range foraging. An increase in the supply of soil nitrogen or phosphorus increases the fractal branching of the mycelia, allowing increased uptake of nutrients.|$|E

[...] And while Linde’s theory shows fractality at scales likely larger than the observable universe, theories like Causal dynamical triangulation and Quantum Einstein gravity are fractal at the opposite extreme, {{in the realm of the}} ultra-small near the Planck scale. [...] These recent theories of quantum gravity describe a <b>fractal</b> <b>structure</b> for spacetime itself, and suggest that the dimensionality of space evolves with time.

40|$|Weak {{interactions}} of solitary {{waves in the}} generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations are studied. It is first shown that these interactions exhibit similar fractal dependence on initial conditions for different nonlinearities. Then by using the Karpman-Solov'ev method, a universal system of dynamical equations is derived for the velocities, amplitudes, positions and phases of interacting solitary waves. These dynamical equations contain a single parameter, which accounts for the different forms of nonlinearity. When this parameter is zero, these dynamical equations are integrable, and the exact analytical solutions are derived. When this parameter is non-zero, the dynamical equations exhibit <b>fractal</b> <b>structures</b> which match those in the original wave equations both qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus the universal nature of <b>fractal</b> <b>structures</b> in the weak interaction of solitary waves is analytically established. The origin of these <b>fractal</b> <b>structures</b> is also explored. It is shown that these structures bifurcate from the initial conditions where the solutions of the integrable dynamical equations develop finite-time singularities. Based on this observation, an analytical criterion for the existence and locations of <b>fractal</b> <b>structures</b> is obtained. Lastly, these analytical results are applied to the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations with various nonlinearities such as the saturable nonlinearity, and predictions on their weak {{interactions of}} solitary waves are made.

INTRODUCTION The hypothesis of <b>fractal</b> <b>structures</b> in language was first formulated by Ludek Hreb'icek (see Hreb'icek 1992 : 91 f) as a consequence of his discovery of sign and vehicle aggregations as supra-sentence structures in texts. This ingenious idea, which was derived from the MenzerathAltmann law, is of great importance for the theory of quantitative linguistics. In recent years Ludek Hreb'icek has undertaken further approaches to characterize language phenomena by fractal dimensions. He has considered text as a time-series and analysed it by means of Hurstexponents (see Hreb'icek 1995, 1997). In this paper I will examine the hyp [...] ...|$|R
