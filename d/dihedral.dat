5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable <b>dihedral</b> on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the <b>dihedral</b> position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E

The other two <b>dihedral</b> angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E

25|$|A polychoric {{group is}} one of five {{symmetry}} groups of the 4-dimensional regular polytopes. There are also three polyhedral prismatic groups, and an infinite set of duoprismatic groups. Each group defined by a Goursat tetrahedron fundamental domain bounded by mirror planes. The <b>dihedral</b> angles between the mirrors determine order of <b>dihedral</b> symmetry. The Coxeter–Dynkin diagram is a graph where nodes represent mirror planes, and edges are called branches, and labeled by their <b>dihedral</b> angle order between the mirrors.|$|E

However, in Euclidean space, scaling a tetrahedron changes its volume but not its <b>dihedral</b> angles, so no such formula can exist.|$|E

40|$|Infrared {{spectra of}} {{dimethyl}} fumarate isolated in low-temperature argon and xenon matrixes {{and of the}} compound in the solid amorphous and crystalline states have been studied. Theoretical calculations, carried out at the MP 2 / 6 - 31 G** and DFT(B 3 LYP) / 6 - 31 G** levels, predict three planar conformers of low internal energy, all of them exhibiting the methyl ester moieties in the cis(C–O) configuration: the conformational ground state (conformer I), with the two OC–CC <b>dihedrals</b> equal to 0 °, and forms II and III, where one or both OC–CC <b>dihedrals</b> are 180 °. In the spectra of the matrix isolated compound, characteristic bands of all three conformers were identified. During annealing of the xenon matrix up to 60 K, conversion of the less stable conformers, II and III, into the most stable conformer, I, was observed. In the amorphous solid, these three conformers could also be identified spectroscopically. The IR and Raman spectra of the crystalline phase clearly show that in the crystal only form I is present, since no bands ascribable to other conformers could be observed.
