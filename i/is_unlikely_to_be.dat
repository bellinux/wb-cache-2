5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enlightening.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) {{has been shown to}} be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E

Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} {{with any other}} species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} {{with any other}} species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located {{very close to the}} front of the head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} recognisable, the Australian magpie <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} {{with any other}} species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> granted.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets. If it {{is due to the}} extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU.|$|E

5|$|It was Ranulf who ordained Thurstan, the archbishop-elect of York, as {{a priest}} in 1115, {{although}} Thurstan {{had to wait for}} consecration as bishop for another four years. Ranulf attended the Council of Reims in 1119 held by Pope Callixtus II. In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate charges against the bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf. The story <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and it <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Sodium lauryl {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E

5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The {{asteroid belt}} contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than a thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could {{transmit}} diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mistaken {{for any other}} mimid species, {{there are several other}} black birds — {{including}} the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|It has {{traditionally}} been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey, and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area {{was referred to as}} the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford. Christ Church treated it as a conventional parish church with a curate, and from the mid-19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar.|$|E
