50|$|In the Grisons, called Churwalchen then, {{the bishop}} of Chur and {{numerous}} local noble families competed for {{the control of the}} region with its many alpine passes. Throughout the 14th century, three leagues of free communities appeared. The Gotteshausbund ("League of the House of God"), covering the area around Chur and the Engadin, was founded when in 1367 the bishop, Jean de Vienne, planned to hand over the administration of his diocese to the Austrian Habsburgs. It bought its freedom by paying the bishop's debt and in the following decades increased its control over the secular administration of the princebishopric, until the bishop's regent was deposed in 1452. In the upper valley of the Rhine, the Grauer Bund ("Gray League") was founded in 1395 {{under the direction of the}} abbot of Disentis and including not only the peasant communities but also the local nobles to end the permanent feuds of the latter. By 1424 the Gray League was dominated by the free communities and gave itself a more <b>democratic</b> <b>charter.</b> The third league, Zehngerichtenbund ("League of the Ten Jurisdictions"), wouldn't be formed until later.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{election}} of May 1686, Walter Clarke was chosen governor of the colony, but served {{only a few weeks}} before the Dominion of New England was imposed on the northern colonies, and Edmund Andros was appointed as the royal governor. Andros ruled for nearly three years, when in April 1689 news of the ascension of William III and Mary II to the English throne arrived in Boston, and Andros and Randolph were both arrested. Clarke called the freemen of the Rhode Island colony together for an election in Newport in May 1689, but wary of the implications of serving at this time, he refused the position, and for ten months Rhode Island was without an acknowledged governor. The October meeting of the General Assembly was poorly attended due to a storm, and it wasn't until February 1690 that they met again. Clarke once again refused to assume the governorship, and Christopher Almy was elected in his place, but also declined. Then, wrote Arnold, quoting historian Bancroft [...] "all eyes turned to one of the old Antinomian exiles, the more than octogenarian, Henry Bull; and the fearless Quaker, true to the light within, employed the last glimmerings of life to restore the <b>democratic</b> <b>charter</b> of Rhode Island." ...|$|R
