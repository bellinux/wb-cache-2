5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game or they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E

The 2004 Census Bureau data showed nearly half of women with annual incomes over $100,000 are childless.|$|E

The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s.

V Corps then would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> close drive together with VII Corps towards Bonn. However, after the first days the American senior command realized that VII Corps would need extra assistance to achieve a breakthrough. Therefore, V Corps was ordered to join the fighting. The Corps was situated south of VII Corps. Gerow's first action was to relieve the 28th Division with the 8th Infantry Division, to assist the drive of the already fighting 4th Division. The division was assisted by a CCR from the 5th Armored Division. The corps took over Hürtgen and Kleinhau as objectives from the 4th Division and started its attack on 21 November.|$|E
25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Nureddin {{chose to}} set his {{defenses}} at the Es Sinn, a bend along the Tigris south of Kut al Amarra. On the north or left bank, he dug in the {{troops of the}} 38th Division {{in a series of}} two networks. Both were anchored on the Tigris River, one extended to Suwada Marsh and the other ended in Ataba Marsh. The Suwada and Ataba marshes were considered impassable swamps. Their size, even in the dry months of late summer and early autumn were thought to make them effective barriers to any large scale enveloping maneuver. To the south of the Tigris, Nureddin constructed another series of trench-works, extending from the river to a strong redoubt. Although the southern trench lines were not anchored by impassable obstacles, the position was on some of the only elevated ground around, giving it an excellent field of fire. What reserves Nureddin did have, he would retain five miles upriver. A floating bridge would allow him to shift forces rapidly, but they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> five-mile march to the fighting to be of use.|$|E

25|$|While most {{throws a}} first baseman must make {{go to the}} right, which a {{left-hander}} can generally accomplish with greater speed and fluency, this is a relatively small factor {{to the advantage of}} a left-handed first baseman. More important advantages are related to the position of a left-handed first baseman with respect to the base. First, a left-handed first baseman has an advantage over his right-handed counterpart when catching a pickoff throw from the pitcher—when a first baseman is in pickoff position, {{standing in front of the}} bag, the left-hander can catch the ball and make a tag without having to move his arm across his body. (See the picture in the Strategy over the course of the game section below for the standard pickoff position with a right-handed first baseman.) Second, because the first baseman starts most plays with his left leg closer to the base, the left-hander does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> half-pivot to get into the correct position to stretch out for a throw. For these reasons, left-handed throwers are far more common at first base than in the general population of baseball players. In contrast, cricket is fielded in the round: the handedness of the fielder in any given position is of far less consequence due to the priority being placed on catching rather than throwing, coupled with the fact that the batsmen are running in opposite directions and both left-handed and right-handed throwers are found in all parts of the field.|$|E

500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people should be open and make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, saying when faced with difficult choices, one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E

Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

500|$|The {{idea of an}} {{expedition}} across the Greenland icecap grew in Nansen's mind throughout his Bergen years. In 1887, after the submission of his doctoral thesis, he finally began organising this project. Before then, the two most significant penetrations of the Greenland interior had been those of Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1883, and Robert Peary in 1886. Both had set out from Disko Bay on the western coast, and had travelled about [...] eastward before turning back. By contrast, Nansen proposed to travel from east to west, ending rather than beginning his trek at Disko Bay. A party setting out from the inhabited west coast would, he reasoned, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> return trip, as no ship could be certain of reaching the dangerous east coast and picking them up. [...] By starting from the east—assuming that a landing could be made there—Nansen's would be a one-way journey towards a populated area. The party would have no line of retreat to a safe base; {{the only way to}} go would be forward, a situation that fitted Nansen's philosophy completely.|$|E
