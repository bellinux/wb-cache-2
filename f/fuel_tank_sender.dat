In order to understand and improve the crashworthiness of the soft <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of helicopter during the crash, this paper investigated the dynamic behavior of the nylon woven fabric composite <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> striking on the ground. A fluid–structure interaction finite element model of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method was constructed to elucidate the dynamic failure behavior. The drop impact tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation. Good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the impact force with the ground. The influences of the impact velocity, the impact angle, the thickness of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wall and the volume fraction of water on the dynamic responses of the dropped <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were studied. The results indicated that the corner of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is the most vulnerable location during the impact with ground.|$|R

40|$|A vortex motion phase {{separator}} is disclosed for transferring {{a liquid}} in a zero gravity environment {{while at the}} same time separating the liquid from vapors found within either the sender or the receiving tanks. The separator comprises a rigid <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> having a circular cross-section and rigid receiver tank having a circular cross-section. A plurality of ducts connects the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> and the receiver tank. Disposed within the ducts connecting the receiver <b>tank</b> and the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> is a pump and a plurality of valves. The pump is powered by an electric motor and is adapted to draw either the liquid or a mixture of the liquid and the vapor from the <b>sender</b> <b>tank.</b> Initially, the mixture drawn from the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> is directed through a portion of the ductwork and back into the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> at a tangent to the inside surface of the <b>sender</b> <b>tank,</b> thereby creating a swirling vortex of the mixture within the <b>sender</b> <b>tank.</b> As the pumping action increases, the speed of the swirling action within the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> increases creating an increase in the centrifugal force operating on the mixture. The effect of the centrifugal force is to cause the heavier liquid to migrate to the inside surface of the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> and to separate from the vapor. When this separation reaches a predetermined degree, control means is activated to direct the liquid conveyed by the pump directly into the receiver tank. At the same time, the vapor within the receiver tank is directed from the receiver tank back into the <b>sender</b> <b>tank.</b> This flow continues until substantially all of the liquid is transferred from the <b>sender</b> <b>tank</b> to the receiver tank...|$|R

In this research work, a numerical model capable to capture the complex impact dynamics of a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> impacting the ground is introduced.
