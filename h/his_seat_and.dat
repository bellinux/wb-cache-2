5|$|In 1917, {{the family}} fell upon hard {{times when the}} elder Fingleton lost <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> resumed {{his job as a}} tram driver, but in 1918 {{contracted}} tuberculosis. The father succumbed in 1920 when Jack was twelve, and the funeral director was Australian Test wicket-keeper Sammy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol {{and drew a}} knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2002, a 28-year-old {{man with}} Down {{syndrome}} opened <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> restraints <b>and</b> stood while the ride was in motion, subsequently falling to his death.

5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were {{captured by the}} Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes {{and the threat of}} a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
60|$|Almayer {{grasped the}} sides of <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>his</b> eyes <b>and</b> mouth opened wide.|$|R

5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E

25|$|Boy racers are {{typically}} known for speeding away from traffic lights, playing loud music, and revving their engines rather than actual street racing.

25|$|Peel felt {{compelled}} to stand for re-election of his seat in Oxford, as he was representing the graduates of Oxford University (many of whom were Anglican clergymen), and had previously stood {{on a platform of}} opposition to Catholic Emancipation.

25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to get his}} attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at rescue, {{one of the}} 7-person crew (wireless operator Lt S.E.S. McLeod), remained strapped to <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> drowned.

25|$|Hampton and the NDP {{won only}} seven {{seats in the}} 2003 Ontario election, losing {{official}} party status {{for the first time}} since 1963. However, Hampton retained <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> the party increased its share of the popular vote by 2 per cent.
