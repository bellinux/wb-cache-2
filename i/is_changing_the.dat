Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl.

Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice <b>is</b> <b>changing.</b> <b>The</b> group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E

The various chapters of the book present selected studies that together illustrate how a more explicit focus on innovation and innovation theory can provide new insights into and generates knowledge about how media innova-tions develop, the sociocultural conditions of such innovations, the role of technology, and power relations in media developments...|$|R

500|$|Injuries {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} big part of American Football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method {{that has been used}} to prevent injuries <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> rules of the sport. An early example of this is the elimination of mass formations like the flying wedge in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused. Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL; a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later. The sharp {{decrease in the number of}} catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques. With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, the NFL has passed rules prohibiting the targeting of [...] "defenseless" [...] players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses his helmet, and placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.|$|E
