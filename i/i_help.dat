500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. <b>I</b> <b>help</b> guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can teach you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} {{toward the end}} of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often {{ignoring}} her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day <b>I</b> <b>help</b> the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E

[...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim.

2500|$|In Somerset West of South Africa, the Kwan Um School of Zen {{once had}} the largest {{following}} of Zen practitioners in the area with their former Dharma Centre, a place that today today acts independent of the Kwan Um organization. Founded in 1982 by Heila Downey, {{a former student of}} Philip Kapleau, the center had for many years acted as an informal affiliate of the Rochester Zen Center in Rochester, New York. In 1989 Dharma Centre began embracing the practices of the Kwan um School of Zen. Heila Downey herself was made a Ji Do Poep Sa Nim, granting her inka, authority to teach within the School. According to Michel Clasquin in the book Westward Dharma: Buddhism Beyond Asia, [...] "There are other Zen groups in South Africa, notably in Johannesburg, but the Dharma Centre, now headquartered in the town of Robertson, is clearly the leading Zen-based organization. The institutional support it receives from the Kwan Um organization means that it is able to import teachers with relative ease. However, {{it should be noted that}} in a suburban satellite center in Cape Town, the Dharma Centre has been forced by popular demand to reinstitute a weekly meditation session shorn of all ritual, much as things were before 1989." [...] According to the Dharma Centre's own website, [...] "With changing times, our practice and teaching has evolved to express a style in harmony with our African heritage resulting in our resignation from the Kwan Um School of Zen." [...] Regardless of this resignation, the center does demonstrate a continuing respect for the teachings of Seungsahn by stating, [...] "As the African Dharma continues to develop and grow, Zen Master Seung Sahn's legacy and teaching will continue to sustain and encourage us in the never-ending quest of 'Who am I' and 'How May <b>I</b> <b>Help</b> You?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could <b>I</b> <b>help</b> it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
