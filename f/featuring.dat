50|$|<b>Feature</b> {{selection}} techniques {{should be}} distinguished from <b>feature</b> extraction. <b>Feature</b> extraction creates new <b>features</b> from functions of the original <b>features,</b> whereas <b>feature</b> selection returns {{a subset of the}} <b>features.</b> <b>Feature</b> selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many <b>features</b> and comparatively few samples (or data points).

30|$|SIFT <b>features</b> are {{invariant}} in rotation, scale, translation, viewing angle, and {{brightness and}} have good robustness to parameter adjustment. The algorithm can effectively express the target <b>feature</b> information. The extraction of local <b>feature</b> points by SIFT algorithm mainly includes four steps: suspected <b>feature</b> points detection, removal of pseudo-feature points, matching of <b>feature</b> points’ gradient and direction, and <b>feature</b> description vector generation. SURF description operator and ORB <b>feature</b> description operator are the improvements of SITF description operator, especially the ORB <b>feature</b> description operator, {{which makes the}} running time of target detection and recognition algorithm take a qualitative leap. The HOG <b>feature</b> description operator implements the object <b>feature</b> description by calculating and counting the gradient histogram of the local region of the image.

The proposed algorithm takes multiple <b>feature</b> models of a part as input and modifies other <b>feature</b> models to reflect the changes made to a <b>feature</b> in a <b>feature</b> model. The proposed algorithm updates <b>feature</b> volumes in other <b>feature</b> models and then classifies the updated volumes to obtain the updated <b>feature</b> model. The spatial arrangement of <b>feature</b> faces and adjacency relationship between <b>features</b> are used to isolate <b>features</b> in a view that are affected by the modification. <b>Feature</b> volumes are updated based on the classification of the <b>feature</b> volume of the modified <b>feature</b> with respect to <b>feature</b> volumes of the model being updated.
