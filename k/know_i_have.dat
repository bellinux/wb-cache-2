5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E

500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the part of Blair, actress Leighton Meester, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel. She has {{described}} the character as multi-faceted, labeling her [...] "a {{little bit of everything}} which is pretty amazing." [...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!" [...] Meester's casting was described by Yahoo! as a star-making role which moved her [...] "into the pop culture vanguard," [...] while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.|$|E

500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> learned {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E
500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of Whitman's {{role at the}} Attorney General's {{office was}} {{interviewing}} former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. [...] "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a fancy for {{anything out of the}} ordinary." [...] In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He hoped it would be its last edition. In February 1868, Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.|$|E

500|$|Schumacher and {{producer}} Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. [...] "There {{was a lot}} of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more family-friendly," [...] Schumacher explained. [...] "We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie and less torture and more heroic. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze's one-liner jokes in his two-star review of the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed the film [...] "killed" [...] the Batman film series, and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script. Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, said, [...] "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should {{go down in history as}} the George Lazenby of the series." [...] However, Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|... "Missing" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew V. Lewis and {{directed}} by Eric Laneuville. Laneuville {{is best known for}} directing episodes of Ghost Whisperer and is also an actor. Daniel Licht who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actor Stephen Barker Turner and actress Keira Naughton guest starred in the episode as Tom and Jennifer Parker. Stink Fisher appeared as Jason Peterson and Slaine starred as Kevin Roban, a drug dealer. Slaine said of his role in the episode, [...] "As a lot of people <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> branched out from hip-hop to acting and this will be my first venture into network television. I’m really looking forward to working on this, as it’s a great show with a fantastic cast". This episode marked the first appearance of Cliff Curtis, who plays Special Agent Derek Ames, a love interest for Megan Hunt (Delany). Curtis was reported to have a role in Body of Proof in November 2010. Curtis was originally meant to be appearing {{towards the end of the}} season. Delany said, [...] "We do have a very dashing FBI agent coming on for the end of the season, played by Cliff Curtis. [...] an old friend, so I wanted him for the role". Afterwards, Curtis appears in one more episode; [...] "Hard Knocks". [...] "Missing" [...] marked the first appearance of Joanna Cassidy since the first season. Cassidy, who plays Joan Hunt has appeared in season one episodes, [...] "Society Hill" [...] and [...] "Buried Secrets". Delany said that Megan's relationship with Joan in the second season would be [...] "tough" [...] because it has been [...] "going on for a long time and most people don’t change after a certain age". Regular cast member Mary Mouser who plays Lacey Fleming, did not appear in this episode.|$|E

[...] He later said [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E

Cricket manager, Mark Robinson said, [...] "I’m delighted that Naveed has agreed to come back for another year. Despite his age, he is still in many ways inexperienced.
