These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey.

40|$|Catalytic {{nucleation}} {{of carbon}} nanotubes (CNTs) remains {{a challenge for}} the theory: Which factors and forces decide if the gathering sp²-network of atoms will adhere to the catalyst particle and fully cover it or the graphitic cap will liberate itself to extend into a <b>hollow</b> <b>filament?</b> This intimate mechanism cannot be seen in experiment, yet it can be investigated through comprehensive molecular dynamics. We systematically vary the adhesion strength (W[sub ad]) of the graphitic cap to the catalyst and temperature T (and C diffusion rate). Observations allow us to build a statistically representative map of CNT nucleation and define the conditions for growth or metal encapsulation in a fullerene-shell (catalyst poisoning). It shows clearly that weak W[sub ad], sufficient thermal kinetic energy (high T) or fast C diffusion favor the CNT nucleation. In particular, below 600 K carbon-diffusion on the catalyst surface limits the growth, but at higher T it fully depends on cap lift-off. Informed choice of parameters allowed us to obtain the longest simulated nanotube structures. The study reveals a means of designing the catalyst for better CNT synthesis, potentially at desirably low temperatures. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{neuroprotective effect}} of {{hypothermia}} {{has long been}} recognized. Use of hypothermia for stroke ther-apy, which is currently being induced by whole body sur-face cooling, has been largely limited because of manage-ment problems and severe side effects (i. e., pneumonia). Our recent studies have demonstrated the significant ther-apeutic value of local brain cooling in the ischemic terri-tory prior to reperfusion in stroke. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if cerebral local cooling infusion could reduce stroke-mediated brain injury by inhibiting inflam-matory responses. A <b>hollow</b> <b>filament</b> was used to block the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 3 hours, and then to locally infuse the ischemic territory with 6 ml cold saline (20 °C) for 10 min prior to 48 -h reperfusion. This cold saline infusion significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced temperature of the MCA supplied territory (in cerebral cortex from 37. 2 ± 0. 1 °C to 33. 4 ± 0. 4 °C, in striatum from 37. 5 ± 0. 2 °C to 33. 9 ± 0. 4 °C), with the hypothermia remaining for at least 45 min after reperfusion. Consequently, significant (P< 0. 01) re-ductions in endothelial expression of intracellular adhe-sion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), the key step for inflammatory progress, as well as leukocyte infiltration, were evident in both cortex and striatum after reperfusion. As a control, ischemic rats received the same amount of cold saline sys-temically through a femoral artery. A mild hypothermia was induced in the cerebral cortex (35. 3 ± 0. 2 °C) but not in the striatum (36. 8 ± 0. 2 °C). The reduced cortical tempera-ture returned to normal within 5 min. Brain temperature in ischemic rats perfused locally with saline at 37 °C re-mained normal. Intensive expression of ICAM- 1 and ac-cumulation of leukocytes was observed in ischemic con-trol groups without brain cooling infusion. In conclusion, brain hypothermia induced by local pre-reperfusion infu-sion ameliorated brain inflammation from stroke...|$|E

In 1996, the missing fossil to help show the evolution of feathers was found. Sinosauropteryx was covered in thin, <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> that covered its back and tail.

40|$|The {{currently}} available clinical imaging methods {{do not provide}} highly detailed information about location and severity of axonal injury or the expected recovery time of patients with traumatic brain injury [1]. High-Definition Fiber Tractography (HDFT) is a novel imaging modality that allows visualizing and quantifying, directly, the degree of axons damage, predicting functional deficits due to traumatic axonal injury and loss of cortical projections. This imaging modality is based on diffusion technology [2]. The inexistence of a phantom able to mimic properly the human brain hinders the possibility of testing, calibrating and validating these medical imaging techniques. Most research done in this area fails in key points, such as the size limit reproduced of the brain fibers and the quick and easy reproducibility of phantoms [3]. For that reason, {{it is necessary to}} develop similar structures matching the micron scale of axon tubes. Flexible textiles can play an important role since they allow producing controlled packing densities and crossing structures that match closely the human crossing patterns of the brain. To build a brain phantom, several parameters {{must be taken into account}} in what concerns to the materials selection, like hydrophobicity, density and fiber diameter, since these factors influence directly the values of fractional anisotropy. Fiber cross-section shape is other important parameter. Earlier studies showed that synthetic fibrous materials are a good choice for building a brain phantom [4]. The present work is integrated in a broader project that aims to develop a brain phantom made by fibrous materials to validate and calibrate HDFT. Due to the similarity between thousands of hollow multifilaments in a fibrous arrangement, like a yarn, and the axons, low twist polypropylene multifilament yarns were selected for this development. In this sense, extruded <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> were analysed in scanning electron microscope to characterize their main dimensions and shape. In order to approximate the dimensional scale to human axons, five types of polypropylene yarns with different linear density (denier) were used, aiming to understand the effect of linear density on the filament inner and outer areas. Moreover, in order to achieve the required dimensions, the polypropylene filaments cross-section was diminished in a drawing stage of a filament extrusion line. Subsequently, tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical behaviour of <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> and to evaluate the differences between stretched and non-stretched filaments. In general, an increase of the linear density causes the increase in the size of the filament cross section. With the increase of structure orientation of filaments, induced by stretching, breaking tenacity increases and elongation at break decreases. The production of hollow fibers, with the required characteristics, is one of the key steps to create a brain phantom that properly mimics the human brain that may be used for the validation and calibration of HDFT, an imaging approach that is expected to contribute significantly to the areas of brain related research...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{fabrication}} of 3 D core-shell filament based lattice structures {{was achieved by}} means of robocasting combined with co-extrusion. For core and shell materials, colloidal gels composed of submicron carbon and alumina powders were developed, respectively. Simultaneously, the co-extrusion process was also studied by numerical simulation to investigate the feed pressure-dependent wall thickness. Design/methodology/approach: Significant differences in the rheological behavior of the carbon and alumina gels were observed due to differences of the particle morphology and surface chemistry of the carbon and alumina powders. Precise control over the cross-sectional diameter of the core and shell green state elements was achieved by alteration of the feed pressures used during co-extrusion. Findings: After subsequent thermal treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere (e. g. air), in which the carbon core was oxidized and burned out, lattice structures formed of <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> of predetermined wall thickness were manufactured; additionally C-Al 2 O 3 core-shell filament lattice structures could be derived after firing in an argon atmosphere.

As feedstocks carbon and alumina gels with significantly different rheological properties were prepared. During co-extrusion the core paste exhibited a much higher viscosity than the shell paste, which benefited the co-extrusion process. Simultaneously, the core and shell diameters were exactly controlled by core and shell feed pressures and studied by numerical simulation.

The compelling need for the controlled assembly of 3 D MT arrays is the fundamental motivation for {{the first part of this}} research. We report on the morphology of MTs grown in a crowded environment in the form of high viscosity fluids containing agarose and a novel process that enables the assembly of MTs supported by gel-based 3 D scaffolds. Our research on MTs and their interaction with other molecules lead us to discover extraordinary spherulitic structures that changed the course of the project. The novel subject situate us into a complicated dilemma that question the nature of MT asters reported in experiments carried out in cells. The second part of this research is focused in the crystallization ofTaxol, a MT stabilizing molecule used as anti-cancer drug. It was confirmed via fluorescent and differential interference contrast microscopy that Taxol crystals can be decorated with fluorescent proteins and fluorochromes without perturbing their morphology. We used theoretical calculations to further investigate Taxol-fluorescent agent interactions. Furthermore, the crystallization of Taxol was studied in pure water, aqueous solutions containing tubulin proteins and tubulin-containing agarose gels. We demonstrated that tubulin is able to heterogeneously nucleate Taxol spherulites. To explain the formation of tubulin-Taxol nuclei a new, secondary Taxol-binding site within the tubulin heterodimer is suggested. Results presented in this work are important for in vivo and in vitro microtubule studies due to the possibility of mistaking these Taxol spherulites for microtubule asters.

5000|$|The {{filamentous}} integumentary {{structures are}} preserved on three {{areas of the}} fossil: in one patch just below the neck, another one on the back, and the largest one above the tail. The <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> are parallel toeach other and are singular with no evidence of branching. They also appear to be relatively rigid, making them more analogous to the integumentary structures found on the tail of Psittacosaurus than to the proto-feather structures found in avian and non-avian theropods. Among the theropods, the structures in Tianyulong are most similar to the singular unbranched proto-feathers of Sinosauropteryx and Beipiaosaurus. The estimated length of the integumentary structures on the tail is about 60 mm which is seven times {{the height of a}} caudal vertebra. Their length and hollow nature argue against of them being subdermal structures such as collagen fibers. Such dermal structures have previously been reported only in derived theropods and ornithischians, and their discovery in Tianyulong extends the existence of such structures further down in the phylogenetic tree. However, the homology between the ornithischian filaments and the theropods' proto-feathers is not obvious. If the homology is supported, the consequence is that the common ancestor of both saurischians and ornithischians were covered by feather-like structures, and that groups for which skin impression are known such as the sauropods were only secondarily featherless. If the homology is not supported, it would indicate that these filamentous dermal structures evolved independently in saurischians and ornithischians, as well as in other archosaurs such as the pterosaurs. The authors (in supplementary information to their primary article) noted that discovery of similar filamentous structures in the theropod Beipiaosaurus bolstered the idea that the structures on Tianyulong are homologous with feathers. Both the filaments of Tianyulong and the filaments of Beipiaosaurus were long, singular, and unbranched. In Beipiaosaurus, however, the filaments were flattened. In Tianyulong, the filaments were round in cross section, and therefore closer in structure to the earliest forms of feathers predicted by developmental models.|$|R
40|$|The HIV- 1 Rev protein {{enables the}} nucleocytoplasmic export of unspliced or {{partially}} spliced mRNAs {{that is required}} for the synthesis of structural proteins. By doing so, it regulates the switch to the late phase of the viral replication cycle (Cullen, 1992). This regulatory control over viral replication makes Rev an attractive target for anti-viral intervention. The development of anti-viral remedies is hindered because the three-dimensional structure of Rev has not yet been solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR. Rev, which polymerizes into regular <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> at high concentrations, forms side-to-side and end-to-side interactions making it prone to aggregation and precipitation (Wingfield et al., 1991). Watts et al. (2000) in an attempt to solve the solubility of Rev discovered a novel interaction between Rev and tubulin. They observed that Rev filaments react with microtubules (MTs) to form Rev-tubulin toroidal (RTT) complexes showing that Rev is a microtubule depolymerizing agent that possibly mimics the mechanism used by Kinesin- 13 proteins, themselves potent microtubule depolymerases. The first goal of the experiments conducted here was to develop a sedimentation assay capable of measuring Rev stimulated microtubule depolymerization. Under the conditions employed here, Rev tubulin toroidal complexes (RTTs) were not formed due to limiting concentrations of magnesium ions so that the amount of tubulin released from microtubule polymers would not reform high molecular weight complexes that would sediment in our assays. Initial experiments determined that bacterial expressed Rev was capable of depolymerizing GMPCPP stabilized microtubules. Depolymerization was not affected by the oligomeric state of Rev. Rev polymerized into filaments or maintained as monomers by the addition of high salt concentrations were equally able to depolymerize microtubules. Microtubule depolymerization appears to be partially dose dependent and occurs at concentrations as low as 300 nM. At low concentrations of Rev, more tubulin is released from the microtubule polymer than there is Rev present in the reaction. This suggests that Rev either has higher affinity for microtubule ends in the lattice or that Rev multimerization is important for depolymerization activity. Depolymerization occurs quickly which is consistent with the findings of Watts et al. (2000). In contrast to the findings of Watts et al. (2000) who demonstrated a complete disappearance of Taxol stabilized microtubules when treated with Rev, Rev was unable to completely depolymerize microtubule polymers stabilized by GMPCPP...|$|R

40|$|Background: Extra {{corporeal}} membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a complex}} rescue therapy used to provide cardiac and/or respiratory support for critically ill patients who have failed maximal conventional medical management. ECMO {{is based on a}} modified cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, and can provide cardiopulmonary support for up-to several months. It {{can be used in a}} veno venous configuration for isolated respiratory failure, (VV-ECMO), or in a veno arterial configuration (VA-ECMO) where support is necessary for cardiac +/- respiratory failure. The ECMO circuit consists of five main components: large bore cannulae (access cannulae) for drainage of the venous system, and return cannulae to either the venous (in VV-ECMO) or arterial (in VA ECMO) system. An oxygenator, with a vast surface area of <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments,</b> allows addition of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide; a centrifugal blood pump allows propulsion of blood through the circuit at upto 10 L/minute; a control module and a thermoregulatory unit, which allows for exact temperature control of the extra corporeal blood. Methods: The first successful use of ECMO for ARDS in adults occurred in 1972, and its use has become more commonplace over the last 30 years, supported by the improvement in design and biocompatibility of the equipment, which has reduced the morbidity associated with this modality. Whilst the use of ECMO in neonatal population has been supported by numerous studies, the evidence upon which ECMO was integrated into adult practice was substantially less robust. Results: Recent data, including the CESAR study (Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Respiratory failure) has added a degree of evidence to the role of ECMO in such a patient population. The CESAR study analysed 180 patients, and confirmed that ECMO was associated with an improved rate of survival. More recently, ECMO has been utilized in numerous situations within the critical care area, including support in high-risk percutaneous interventions in cardiac catheter lab; the operating room, emergency department, as well in specialized inter-hospital retrieval services. The increased understanding of the risk:benefit profile of ECMO, along with a reduction in morbidity associated with its use will doubtless lead to a substantial rise in the utilisation of this modality. As with all extra-corporeal circuits, ECMO opposes the basic premises of the mammalian inflammation and coagulation cascade where blood comes into foreign circulation, both these cascades are activated. Anti-coagulation is readily dealt with through use of agents such as heparin, but the inflammatory excess, whilst less macroscopically obvious, continues un-abated. Platelet consumption and neutrophil activation occur rapidly, and the clinician is faced with balancing the need of anticoagulation for the circuit, against haemostasis in an acutely bleeding patient. Alterations in pharmacokinetics may result in inadequate levels of disease modifying therapeutics, such as antibiotics, hence paradoxically delaying recovery from conditions such as pneumonia. Key elements of nutrition and the innate immune system maysimilarly be affected. Summary: This presentation will discuss the basic features of ECMO to the nonspecialist, and review the clinical conundrum faced by the team treating these most complex cases...|$|R
40|$|The Rev {{protein is}} Human Immunodeficiency virus 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 switch 2 ̆ 2 from events {{occurring}} early in infection to later events. Early in infection, the 13 KDa Rev protein begins to accumulate {{in the host}} cell nucleus. Once enough Rev is produced, Rev stimulates a switch in viral gene expression by multimerizing onto nuclear viral RNAs and stimulating their export into the cytoplasm. Multimerization occurs on an RNA structure called the Rev Response Element (RRE). Several Rev monomers bind the RRE and once that threshold is met the Rev-RRE complex is exported out of the nucleus. Once out of the nucleus the Rev-RRE complex dissociates and Rev imports back into the nucleus for another cycle of export. Rev 2 ̆ 7 s unique function makes it a theoretically ideal target for inhibiting viral replication. Consequently, understanding the three-dimensional structure of Rev will promote drug design. Obtaining structural information is difficult because Rev aggregates. While trying to find solutions conditions for crystallography, Watts et al. (2000) discovered Rev depolymerizes microtubules in vitro forming bilayered rings called Rev-Tubulin Toroids (RTTs). RTTs also form when Rev is mixed with tubulin heterodimers. Similar rings form when MCAK {{and other members of}} the Kinesin 13 family of microtubule-associated proteins (Kin- 13) are mixed with tubulin. The similar primary and secondary structure of Rev (amino acids 34 - 57) and MCAK (amino acids 506 - 530) has prompted Watts et al. to hypothesize that the two proteins interact with tubulin and microtubules by a shared mechanism. Studies have shown mutating amino acids within this shared region has a detrimental affect on Kin- 13 ability to depolymerize microtubules and form spindles. Therefore, Rev may serve as a model to further the understanding how Kin- 13 proteins function. To test Rev 2 ̆ 7 s ability to be used as a model for Kin- 13 interaction with tubulin point mutations were introduced into the shared region, (A 37 D, R 42 A, E 47 A, and E 57 A). Then purified proteins were mixed with tubulin heterodimers to see if RTTs form. The A 37 D, E 47 A, and E 57 A mutations do not have any meaningful affect on Rev structure. All were able to form <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> at high concentrations comparable to filaments formed with wtRev. When mixed with tubulin, A 37 D, E 47 A, and E 57 A form RTTs with similar ring diameter and thickness as wild-type rings. These results suggest that the mutated amino acids are unimportant for Rev-tubulin interactions. These data are somewhat consistent with data published for MCAK. The A - 3 ̆e D substitution in MCAK also has no affect on MCAK activity. The glutamic acid corresponding to E 47 has not been tested in MCAK and this warrants testing. The glutamic acid corresponding to E 57 in MCAK behaves differently. This residue is essential for MCAK activity whereas it appears to have no effect on Rev-tubulin interactions. These data suggest that Rev and MCAK may work by different mechanisms. Mutation of RevR 42 had significant effects on RTT formation. R 42 A does not interact with tubulin heterodimers and RTTs do not form. Moreover, the mutation affects the thickness of Rev filaments suggesting that this amino acid is important for Rev-Rev and Rev-tubulin interactions. Mutating the corresponding amino acid in MCAK will be an interesting test of the hypothesis that Rev and MCAK act by a shared mechanism...|$|R
