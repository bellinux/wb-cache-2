5000|$|Open-loop: Pump-inlet and motor-return (via the {{directional}} valve) {{are connected}} to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tank.</b> The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed [...] "circuit". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is returned to tank through the control valve's open center; that is, when the control valve is centered, it provides an open return path to tank and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if the control valve is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid returns to tank through a pressure relief valve. Multiple control valves may be stacked in series. This type of circuit can use inexpensive, constant displacement pumps.|$|E
50|$|At least 25% of {{the input}} power must be {{dissipated}} by the cooler when peak power is utilized for long periods. In normal case however, the peak power {{is used for}} only short periods, thus the actual cooler capacity required might be considerably less. The oil volume in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tank</b> is also acting as a heat accumulator when peak power is used. The system efficiency is very much dependent {{on the type of}} hydraulic work tool equipment, the hydraulic pumps and motors used and power input to the hydraulics may vary a lot. Each circuit must be evaluated and the load cycle estimated. New or modified systems must always be tested in practical work, covering all possible load cycles. An easy way of measuring the actual average power loss in the system is to equip the machine with a test cooler and measure the oil temperature at cooler inlet, oil temperature at cooler outlet and the oil flow through the cooler, when the machine is in normal operating mode. From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank. One problem can be to assemble the measuring equipment inline, especially the oil flow meter.|$|E

40|$|Increasing demands {{regarding}} performance, {{safety and}} environmental compatibility of hydraulic mobile machines {{in combination with}} rising cost pressures create a growing need for specialized optimization of hydraulic systems; {{particularly with regard to}} hydraulic reservoirs. In addition to the secondary function of cooling the oil, two main functions of the hydraulic reservoir are oil storage and de-aeration of the hydraulic oil. While designing hydraulic reservoirs regarding oil storage is quite simple, the design regarding de-aeration can be quite difficult. The author presents an approach to a system optimization of hydraulic reservoirs which combines experimental and numerical techniques to resolve some challenges facing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tank</b> design. Specialized numerical tools are used in order to characterize the de-aeration performance of hydraulic tanks.

Preliminary results of temperature surveys of the thermal plume at the D. C. Cook Plant are presented. Indications are that the spatial extent of the plume at the surface is much smaller than previous results for surface shoreline discharges, particularly in the near and intermediate portions of the plume. Comparisons of limited prototype data with <b>hydraulic</b> (<b>tank)</b> -model predictions indicate that the model predictions for centerline temperature decay at the surface are too high for the initial 200 m from the discharge, but are generally correct beyond this point to the limits of the model. In addition, the hydraulic-model results underestimate the areal extent of the near and intermediate portions of the plume at the surface. Because this is the first report of a new field program, several inadequacies in the field-measurement techniques are noted and discussed. New techniques that have been developed to remedy these deficiencies, and which will be implemented for future field work, are also described. (auth...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} this paper is the {{integration}} of solar energy into industrial heat supply systems – focusing on the use of solar tanks. Within the framework of the project “Solar Process Heat Standards” funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) load profiles of electroplating processes were measured, a typical load profile was described and simulations were done regarding the dimensioning of the solar tank volume. Depending on the load profile and process temperature, either a large tank volume or a tank-less system leads to the highest solar yields. Furthermore, a new concept of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tank</b> integration is presented. It facilitates the quick supply of high solar temperatures which are often demanded for solar process heat applications. State of the art tank integration makes the solar system thermally inert, while simulations and measurements have already proven a considerable advantage of the new alternative. Moreover four solar process heat applications are analyzed; three belong to the electroplating industry while the fourth uses solar energy for heating water in the food industry (193 – 570 m 2). Especially two of the four solar process heat plants presented severe operating errors and a high optimizing potential. One solar plant was improved in order to facilitate the new storage concept. This modification ensures the possibility of shifting between the conventional storage integration and the innovative approach for a comparative evaluation...|$|E

The project comprise 22, 5 ECTS. Volvo Construction Equipment, located in Arvika, was the client in this project. The mentor at Volvo CE was Åsa Barck, and the mentor at Karlstad University was Monica Jakobsson. The examiner was Fredrik Thuvander, professor at Karlstad University. Volvo CE produces ten different kinds of wheel loaders. The main issues in this degree project were two different hydraulic reservoir tanks that Volvo CE assembles on various kinds of wheel loaders. The problem that the student faced in this project was that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tank</b> packaging, today are not safe enough.

This can drastically increase the CPU time cost related to the design step, especially if the system energy management and sizing are sequentially integrated into a two level optimization process. In order to solve this problem and accelerate the system simulation, two complementary approaches are suggested. On one hand, metamodels are used for representing the system constraints and objectives. On the other hand, PV and wind cycles are compacted with a synthesis procedure which preserves their influence on the system performance with regard to the reference data.

The electric network is composed of consumers and of a battery bank for electrical storage,while the hydraulic part is made of motor-pumps and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tanks</b> for water production and desalination. Both battery and water tanks are used to optimize the power management of both electric and hydraulic subsystems by ensuring electric load demand and by reducing {{at the same time}} water deficit following the operation of the renewable intermittent source. Thus, both electric and hydraulic subsystems are strongly coupled in terms of energy making necessary to manage the power flows provided by renewable sources to optimize the overall system performance. In this paper, two kinds of management strategies are then compared in the way they share the hybrid power sources between the storage devices (battery and tanks) and the electrical/hydraulic loads. The first approach deals with an “uncoupled power management” in which the operation of electrical and hydraulic loads does not depend {{on the state of the}} intermittent renewable sources: in particular, hydraulic pumps are operated only taking account of water demand and tank filling but without considering power sources. On the contrary, given the available power produced by the sources, the second class of strategy (i. e. the “coupled management strategy”) consists of a “smart” power sharing between the electrical and hydraulic networks with regard to the battery SOC and the tank L 1 and L 2. A dynamic simulator of the hybrid energy system has been developed and tested using a MATLAB environment. The system performance is shown under the two investigated approaches (uncoupled vs coupled).
