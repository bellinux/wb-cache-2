5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E

After a trans-Atlantic phone call reveals {{her mother is}} struggling to cope, Eilis returns home for a visit. Tony insists that they must get married first without telling family or friends. In Ireland, everybody seems to be conspiring to keep Eilis from leaving. Her best friend is getting married a week after her scheduled return journey, and her mother has already accepted the invitation on her behalf. She fills in part-time at her late sister's old bookkeeping job, {{which leads to the}} possibility of a full-time job. She goes on dates with an eligible and well-off bachelor. Eilis starts to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> now has a future in Ireland that did not exist when she left and stops opening the letters she receives from Tony.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{problems}} caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries {{to take over the}} wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on New Years Eve in 1999, in a joint wedding with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). They live with Barry's father Roy (Tony Caunter) and stepmother Pat (Pam St. Clement) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son Jack (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002—the birth is traumatic as Jack was born feet first. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half brother, Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives.

500|$|The android {{head nurse}} ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (Jordan Lund) {{also help to}} combat the {{frequent}} medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as [...] "extremely efficient and attractive", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sets an impossible standard for them to match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries {{to learn more about}} them. Batung, who is part of the slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the Chief of Staff Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues.|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert B. Stepto {{states that}} the poem [...] "One More Round", in And Still I Rise is heavily {{influenced}} by the work and protest songs of the past. The even-number stanzas in the eight-stanza poem create a refrain like those found in many work songs and are variations of many protest poems. Stepto is impressed with Angelou's {{creation of a new}} art form out of work and protest forms, but does not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> develops it enough. He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And Still I Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". Despite Angelou's strong criticism of racism, she also asserted in all her writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme, that [...] "we are more alike than unalike".|$|E

500|$|In {{a segment}} of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women {{covering}} the Kinne case, episode entitled [...] "Born bad", James Hays, author of I'm just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story speculates that Kinne committed her first murder for pecuniary gain, hoping to cash in on James Kinne's life insurance policy, and that she began to derive pleasure from killing at that point. Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong supports this assertion with her theory that Kinne is a sociopath, lacking in remorse and empathy, and therefore had no compunction about killing to get what she wanted — be it life insurance, marriage to her boyfriend, or cash. This idea is echoed by some of those involved in prosecuting Kinne, who <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a [...] "psychopath" [...] and born bad. [...] and that [...] "her solution to a problem was to kill somebody". Even those who believe in her guilt, however, note that Kinne had a certain appeal, describing her as [...] "rather attractive" [...] and admitting that they grew to like her. The Mammoth Book of True Crime describes her as a relative rarity, a [...] "pretty" [...] criminal.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

500|$|Webber hired Ben van Os as his {{production}} designer because [...] "... he wasn't {{intimidated by the}} period obligations. He was {{much more interested in}} story and character." [...] For inspiration in constructing the film's sets, Webber and van Os studied the works of Vermeer and other artists of the period, such as Gerard ter Borch. Set designer Todd van Hulzen said the goal was to [...] "... reflect that quiet, sober, almost moralizing ethos that you see in Dutch paintings." [...] They built Vermeer's house on one of Luxembourg's largest film soundstages, a three-story set where they designed rooms that were meant to convey a lack of privacy. According to van Os, the film was about [...] "being observed," [...] so they intended Griet to always <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was being watched. In addition, they built two other interior sets to represent the homes of Griet and van Ruijven– Griet's home possessed Calvinistic characteristics while van Ruijven's contained mounted animals to reflect his [...] "predatory nature." [...] The Mauritshuis museum made a high resolution photograph of the actual painting, which was then shot on a rostrum camera {{to be used in the}} film.|$|E
500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can be very, how do you say, temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [...] was sexist, plain and simple." ...|$|E
