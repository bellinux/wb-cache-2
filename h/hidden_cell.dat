60|$|The {{room was}} swaying round her: the {{furniture}} started hopping and dancing. Louisa, {{who had never}} fainted in her life, {{felt as if the}} floor was giving way under her feet. Memory was unloading one of her storehouses, looking over the contents of a <b>hidden</b> <b>cell,</b> wherein she had put away a strange winter scene in Brussels, a taxicab, the ill-lighted boulevard, the chauffeur getting down from his box and finding a man crouched in the farther corner of the cab--dead--with his throat pierced from ear to ear by an instrument which might have been a skewer. And memory was raking out that cell, clearing it in every corner, trying to find the recollection of a certain morning in Battersea Park a year ago, when Louisa recounted her impressions of that weird scene and told the tale of this crime which she had almost witnessed. Memory found a distinct impression that she had told the tale at full length and with all the details which she knew. She remembered talking it all over, and, that when she did so, the ground in Battersea Park was crisp with the frost under her feet, and an inquisitive robin perched himself on the railings and then flew away accompanying her and another all the way along as far as the gates.|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, a {{neural network}} {{requires}} the following steps. To begin, each cell of the input layer receives a value (0 or 1) {{corresponding to the}} response values in the exemplar vector. Each input cell then passes the value it receives to every <b>hidden</b> <b>cell.</b> Each <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> forms a linearly weighted sum of its input and transforms the sum using the logistic function and passes the result to every output cell. Each output cell, in turn, forms a linearly weighted sum of its inputs from the hidden cells and transforms it using the logistic function, and outputs the result. Because the result is scaled using the logistic transformation, the output values range from 0 to 1. The result {{can be interpreted as}} the probability the correct or target value for each output will have a value of 1.|$|E

40|$|For {{quantitative}} {{understanding of}} probabilistic behaviors of living cells, {{it is essential}} to construct a correct mathematical description of intracellular networks interacting with complex cell environments, which has been a formidable task. Here, we present a novel model and stochastic kinetics for an intracellular network interacting with <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> environments, employing a complete description of cell state dynamics and its coupling to the system network. Our analysis reveals that various environmental effects on the product number fluctuation of intracellular reaction networks can be collectively characterized by Laplace transform of the time-correlation function of the product creation rate fluctuation with the Laplace variable being the product decay rate. On the basis of the latter result, we propose an efficient method for quantitative analysis of the chemical fluctuation produced by intracellular networks coupled to <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> environments. By applying the present approach to the gene expression network, we obtain simple analytic results for the gene expression variability and the environment-induced correlations between the expression levels of mutually noninteracting genes. The theoretical results compose a unified framework for quantitative understanding of various gene expression statistics observed across a number of different systems with a small number of adjustable parameters with clear physical meanings.

40|$|Biopics {{have found}} a {{promising}} market in Brazil. In the last twenty years, approximately fifty long feature movies were biographies of singers, actors, politicians, athletes, and musicians. The majority of the productions is canonic regarding narrative choices and depiction of their biography subject. One example seems to escape the formula and has stirred the attention and opinion of viewers, critics, and society. Curumim (Prado, 2016), a documentary by Marcos Prado, is a hybrid of auto/thanatography, testimonio, and biography of Marcos Archer, a middle- class Brazilian drug dealer arrested in Thailand and sent to prison in Indonesia for eleven years. During his time in jail, several attempts {{were made by the}} Brazilian government to avoid the death penalty; a sentence usually applied to cases of drug trafficking in Indonesia. In January of 2015, Archer was finally was executed. The movie is a joined effort of the filmmaker and the drug dealer. With a <b>hidden</b> <b>cell</b> phone and memory cards sent to him unbeknownst by the guards, the narrative created by Archer, aka Curumin, defies strict categories of a genre in the autobiographic realm. While exposing the life behind bars, Archer examines himself and his life and believes he will be pardon. A movie diary? An auto/thanatography, in the sense that Susanna Egan understands it as a narrative that “focus[es] on illness, pain, and imminent death as crucial to the process of that life” (Egan, 1999, p. 224) ? Or a cautionary tale despite the unexpected outcome? This paper will reflect on the biographic temptation in Brazilian movie industry and the particulars of Curumin, as a paradox of this trend...|$|E

40|$|Recently, machine {{learning}} methods {{have provided a}} broad spectrum of original and efficient algorithms based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to automatically predict an outcome with respect to a sequence of inputs. Recurrent <b>hidden</b> <b>cells</b> allow these DNN-based models to manage long-term dependencies such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Nevertheless, these RNNs process a single input stream in one (LSTM) or two (Bidirectional LSTM) directions. But most of the information available nowadays is from multistreams or multimedia documents, and require RNNs to process these information synchronously during the training. This paper presents an original LSTM-based architecture, named Parallel LSTM (PLSTM), that carries out multiple parallel synchronized input sequences in order to predict a common output. The proposed PLSTM method could be used for parallel sequence classification purposes. The PLSTM approach is evaluated on an automatic telecast genre sequences classification task and compared with different state-of-the-art architectures. Results show that the proposed PLSTM method outperforms the baseline n-gram models as well as the state-of-the-art LSTM approach. Comment: 2016 IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technolog...|$|R

As he walked out, Lamb responded coldly towards Mr. Manning's claims of being a victim of Veronica and Duncan and left the house again. He then gets into his vehicle and after driving several blocks down the road, silently pulls over to the sidewalk and releases Veronica and Duncan from the car. Returning to the Manning family's home, he parks his car and watches the house, to let the Mannings know their secret is out. This, as he was powerless to officially arrest them for child abuse, due to Veronica and Duncan's involvement tainting any sort of investigation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{self-organizing}} computing {{network based}} on concepts of fuzzy conditions, beliefs, probabilities, and neural networks is proposed for decision-making in intelligent systems which {{are required to}} handle data sets with a diversity of data types. A sensefunction with a sense-range and fuzzy edges {{is defined as a}} transfer function for connections from the input layer to the hidden layer in the network. By generating <b>hidden</b> <b>cells</b> and adjusting the parameters of the sense-functions, the network self-organizes and adapts to a training set. Computing cells in the input layer are designed as data converters so that the network can deal with both symbolic data and numeric data. Hidden computing cells in the network can be explained via fuzzy rules in a similar manner to those in fuzzy neural networks. The values in the output layer can be explained as a belief distribution over a decision space. The final decision is made by means of the winner-take-all rule. The approach was applied to a series of the benchmark data sets with a diversity of data types and comparative results obtained. Based on these results, the suitability of a range of data types for processing by different intelligent techniques was analyzed, and the results show that the proposed approach is better than other approaches for decision-making in information systems with mixed data types.
