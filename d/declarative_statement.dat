2500|$|It is {{also used}} without a {{predicate}} nominative, which is not very common in Koine Greek, thus some interpret it as Jesus' own self-declaration as God. In [...] Jesus states: [...] "For unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins", and later the crowd attempts to stone Jesus {{in response to his}} statement in : [...] "Before Abraham was, I am.". Many other translations including the ASV have rendered John 8:24 as something like [...] "... For unless you believe that I am , you will die in your sins.". Some consider the phrase in John 8:58 to be grammatically different from that in John 8:24, as the copulative verb can be used with any predicative expression and not only a predicate nominative, such as in [...] "ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἦτε" [...] ("where I am, you also may be") in [...] [...] "πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι" [...] ("before Abraham was") can be taken as a predicative prepositional phrase, thus [...] "ἐγώ εἰμὶ" [...] ("I am") in John 8:58 does not grammatically require a predicate nominative, however it is rather unusual for a present tense verb to be used with a temporal adverb like πρὶν in a <b>declarative</b> <b>statement,</b> though there are rare exceptions outside the New Testament. Thus explanations of John 8:58 generally depend on theology and not Greek grammar.|$|E

The result is a negation of the original <b>declarative</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E

50|$|Similarly to English, {{for each}} clause in Tokelauan {{there is a}} {{predicate}}. There are five types of predicates including: verbal, locative, existential, possessive, and nominal. Each predicate is available for an interrogative and <b>declarative</b> <b>statement,</b> and can also have multiple predicates conjoined.|$|E
50|$|A <b>declarative</b> <b>statement</b> {{should not}} be deemed synonymous with an affirmative one. This is because {{although}} a <b>declarative</b> <b>statement</b> can state facts (given that the speaker is not consciously lying), it can also express something which is not true. The information {{he or she is}} providing, regardless of whether it be true or not in reality, is in fact true or false to that speaker. Therefore, a declarative can be either in the affirmative or in the negative, and we can say that, Joanna is late and Joanna is not late, both technically qualify as declarative sentences. Declarative refers to a sentence's function or purpose, while affirmative and negative deal with a sentence's veracity, or grammatical polarity, which is why the different terms can overlap simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|In {{object-oriented}} programming languages such as C++, Object Pascal, or Java, {{the concept of}} abstraction has itself become a <b>declarative</b> <b>statement</b> - using the keywords '''' (in C++) or '''' and '''' (in Java).

5000|$|Tag {{questions}} are a grammatical structure {{in which a}} <b>declarative</b> <b>statement</b> or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment (the [...] "tag"), such as right in [...] "You remembered the eggs, right?", or isnt it in [...] "Its cold today, isnt it?"

5000|$|A {{question}} tag or tag question (also {{known as}} tail question) is a grammatical structure {{in which a}} <b>declarative</b> <b>statement</b> or an imperative is turned into interrogative fragment (the [...] "tag"). For example, in the sentence [...] "You're John, aren't you?", the statement [...] "You're John" [...] is turned into a question by the tag [...] "aren't you".

50|$|Interrogative {{sentences}} {{can serve}} as yes-no questions or as wh-questions, the latter being formed using an interrogative word such as who, which, where or how to specify the information required. Different languages have different ways of forming questions, {{including the use of}} different word order and the insertion of interrogative particles. Questions are also frequently marked by intonation, in particular a rising intonation pattern - in some languages this may be the sole method of distinguishing a yes-no question from a <b>declarative</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{there seems}} to be principally good news being {{reported}} with bad news is minimal. Furthermore, except for the actual CSR levy of 2 % of book profits which is a mandatory contribution according to local legislation, there items being reported are mainly declarative in nature with no actual monetary commitments being undertaken by the organisation. The CSR initiatives are targeted towards some of the main stakeholders of the organisation namely government and society, employees and the customers. Despite the fact that according to the CSR legislation in Mauritius, internal CSR towards employees is not considered to form part of CSR initiatives, labour is one most prominent themes of CSR disclosure for this company in line with Ramdhony (2015). This  could in fact be more in line with more strategic objectives of the organisation while CSR targeted towards the other 3 stakeholder groups seems to be mostly symbolic behaviour for instance  taking commitments towards certain initiatives with mainly <b>declarative</b> <b>statements</b> instead of substantive involvement by means of monetary commitments to CSR initiatives’ which reflects actual commitment towards socially responsible behaviour. Symbolic engagement by means of <b>declarative</b> <b>statements</b> do not necessarily reflect actual implementation within the organisation.|$|R

40|$|Declarative {{data quality}} {{has been an}} active {{research}} topic. The fundamental principle behind a declarative approach to data quality {{is the use of}} <b>declarative</b> <b>statements</b> to realize data quality primitives on top of any relational data source. A primary advantage of such an approach is the ease of use and integration with existing applications. Over {{the last couple of years}} several similarity predicates have been proposed for common quality primitives (approximate selections, joins, etc.) and have been fully expressed using <b>declarative</b> SQL <b>statements.</b> In this thesis, new similarity predicates are proposed along with their declarative realization, based on notions of probabilistic information retrieval. Then, full declarative specifications of previously proposed similarity predicates in the literature are presented, grouped into classes according to their primary characteristics. Finally, a thorough performance and accuracy study comparing a large number of similarity predicates for data cleaning operations is performed...|$|R
