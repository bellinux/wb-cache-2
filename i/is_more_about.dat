5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} a contribution to art history, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a picture {{is a model of}} reality.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of a dog reflects {{the status of the}} owner: dressing a dog <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the owner than the animal. When an owner dresses up their dog they establish a unique bond with the dog that places them at an even more personal and intimate level.|$|E

25|$|Ishida Hitoshi {{makes the}} case that the image of the bishōnen <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> a {{grounding}} in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 60's, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, Wallenstein <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{developing}} territories rather than conquering them. However, it can certainly {{be beneficial to}} take another player's territory after they have already spent resources to develop it. Because of the reliability of receiving victory points from buildings and the uncertainties of battles due to the cube tower, most players tend to avoid conflict {{in the first year}} in order to amass larger armies for the second year.|$|E
25|$|Since Tracey is {{actually}} Lavinia's gardener, he is naturally {{called in the}} next morning to investigate the damage K9's pursuit of him caused to the greenhouse. After Brendan attempts to brag about the pH balance of the soil, Tracey sharply comments that gardening <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> respect for nature than scientific theory. Otherwise, though, he doesn't betray his more sinister intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the panels}} have survived, that by Lorenzo Ghiberti {{and that by}} Brunelleschi. Each panel shows some {{strongly}} classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti has used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. He kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also {{a reference to the}} art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> human drama and impending tragedy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> sexual benefits than love, {{and that she}} is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer {{wants to be the}} star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with online magazine Bossip, West clarified {{that he believed}} in God, but [...] "would never go into a religion," [...] explaining that [...] "I feel like religion <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> separation and judgment than bringing people together and understanding.

500|$|The {{game was}} praised for its variety of tracks, and steady {{increase}} in difficulty. GameSpy's Jason D'Aprile thought the game [...] "was {{something of a}} [...] racer. It took lots of practice, good memorization skills, and a rather fine sense of control." [...] Matt Taylor of The Virginian-Pilot commented that the game <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> [...] "reflexes than realism", and it lacked the ability to save progress between races. F-Zeros soundtrack was lauded.|$|E
500|$|Although most of {{the reviews}} were positive, some film experts were {{critical}} about the film. Amaresh Datta, in his book The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, criticised the film for [...] "following the neo-realistic style" [...] and showcasing [...] "same old love story without any freshness added". Poet and journalist C. P. Surendran called the film [...] "disturbing" [...] {{in one of his}} articles, criticising Gopalakrishnan and his films. Shyam Benegal, a film director and a well-known admirer of Gopalakrishnan's films, also mentioned that he was not particularly pleased with Swayamvaram. Some critics have pointed out its resemblance to Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (1965). Gopalakrishnan agreed on influences of Ghatak and Satyajit Ray but pointed that Swayamvarams treatment is different from Ghatak's Subarnarekha as Swayamvaram <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the trip.|$|E
500|$|Tom Flanagan, a {{conservative}} {{professor of political}} science at the University of Calgary, has argued that Conservapedia <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> religion, specifically Christianity, than conservatism and that it [...] "is far more guilty of the crime they're attributing to Wikipedia" [...] than Wikipedia itself. Matt Millham of the military-oriented newspaper Stars and Stripes called Conservapedia [...] "a Web site that caters mostly to evangelical Christians". Its scope as an encyclopedia, according to its founders, [...] "offers a historical record from a Christian and conservative perspective". APC magazine perceives this to be representative of Conservapedia's own problem with bias. Conservative Christian commentator Rod Dreher has been highly critical of the website's [...] "Conservative Bible Project", an ongoing retranslation of the Bible which Dreher attributes to [...] "insane hubris" [...] on the part of [...] "right-wing ideologues".|$|E
5|$|Later, Hamilton {{published}} In Search of J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life (1935–65), {{but this}} book <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{his experience in}} tracking down information and the copyright fights over the planned biography than about Salinger himself.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in Mothering, writer Carol Jean-Swanson makes similar points, {{noting that}} the {{original}} figure of St. Nicholas gave {{only to those who}} were needy and that today Santa Claus seems to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> conspicuous consumption: ...|$|R
50|$|A 2003 {{worldwide}} {{survey by}} the Pew Research Center found that overall women stated that they were somewhat happier than men with their lives.

Women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned <b>about</b> home and family issues than men who <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned <b>about</b> issues outside the home. Men were happier than women regarding the family life and more optimistic regarding the children's future.|$|R
500|$|Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury said Darren and Cindy's scheming {{make them}} a perfect match. Laws commented that Darren and Cindy's {{relationship}} <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> [...] "making money out of others’ misery" [...] rather than romance, and sarcastically commented that the pair were [...] "nice" [...] after they decide to con Hannah and Tony. On Darren and Cindy's intention to scam Tony the Daily Star wrote: [...] "Cindy and Darren are perfect for each other. They are both greedy money-grabbers and it isn’t long before {{they are looking for}} a way to fleece Tony for all they can get". MSN said the sexual chemistry between Darren and Cindy was undeniable after Cindy's return. On Darren and Cindy, Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail questioned if there was [...] "anyone either of these two haven't had now? I'm getting sex-sickness".|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. {{lived in}} the Bedford-Stuyvesant {{neighbourhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman (a.k.a. Benjamin Brewer), an environmentalist, founder of Green Owl, musician {{and member of the}} Bronfman family and Lehman family. They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, just three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: [...] "I think it’s weird. It’s not that I got with Ben and then suddenly I was a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it’s interesting that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is on paper sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{said she}} enjoyed {{designing}} Fame Kills with West, calling themselves [...] "creative kindreds." [...] She {{explained that they}} did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for [...] "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. [...] "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what hip-hop means", she said. [...] "For me, the tour <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." [...] She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. [...] "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Steven Moffat {{said that}} putting dinosaurs on a {{spaceship}} was [...] "the secret of success". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who {{came from the}} special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was a darker opening episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, [...] "Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes [...] "42" [...] (2007), [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood" [...] (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written {{the return of the}} Silurians in [...] "The Hungry Earth"/"Cold Blood", felt that it was [...] "a nice reveal and shows you more about them, even in a story that isn’t really about them".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] it struck me that what we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
50|$|Stephen Totilo of Kotaku {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} about the concert, saying he liked it but did not love it, and criticized the triple-encore structure and the emphasis on battle themes, saying he thought the series <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> adventure than combat.|$|R
