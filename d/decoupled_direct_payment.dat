40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{dynamic programming}} model {{is used to}} compare the farmland investment impact of a fully <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> and a standard price subsidy. The direct payment induces the farmer to invest because it lowers the farm’s debt to asset ratio, which in turn reduces the probability of bankruptcy. The value of the real option to defer the investment decision is lower with a lower risk of bankruptcy, and thus the direct payment results in a higher probability of immediate investment. Simulation results demonstrate that for a farm facing moderate revenue and land price variability, the impact of a <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> on farm investment is nearly as large as the investment impact of an equal-sized price subsidy. These results suggest that direct payments, such as those associated with U. S. production flexibility contracts, should be carefully scrutinized in on-going multilateral trade negotiations.

40|$|Abstract Among the {{numerous}} non-point sources of diffuse water pollution with nitrogen, agriculture is counted {{one of the}} main sources. The agricultural policies of the Agenda 2000 and a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> for farmers from their production decisions are exemplarily evaluated as nitrogen reduction measures using the Regional Agricultural and Environmental Information System RAUMIS. The results show that until the target year 2010 the risk of diffuse pollution of water bodies with nitrogen is a regional problem in Germany. These problems are neither mitigated by the policies of Agenda 2000 nor by a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> from production decisions of farmers. While total nitrogen surplus reduces considerably after a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> due to decreases of land-use the nitrogen surplus on the remaining cultivated area increases resulting from structural changes.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{goes beyond}} {{orthodox}} considerations of direct payment e®ects on agri-cultural output, by highlighting {{the role of}} subsidies in a®ecting individual producers ' ability to cover ¯xed costs, and in distorting the volume of aggregate production and net trade by implic-itly discouraging exits. The theoretical model considers both taxpayer and consumer ¯nanced <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> schemes and compares them to a coupled production subsidy. In terms of possible producer responses to direct payments, we propose an analytical framework of production decision-making {{in the presence of}} a stochastic distribution of ¯xed costs across representative farms. We show that decoupled payments in theory can have a larger e®ect on output than coupled payments. The model explicitly recognizes three consequences of domes-tic support: (a) induce exit or entry; (b) bias production incentives to domestic markets; and (c) cross-subsidize export in global markets. An empirical model of the U. S. wheat sector is developed to illustrate the relative potential impacts of coupled versus decoupled payments on output through the e®ects on a farmer's ability to cover ¯xed costs and hence exit decisions...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{government}} supports the farming sector, {{the question about}} the distributional impact of this support bothers agricultural economists. However, studies on support distribution have not been concerned about the part-time characteristics of farms. Part-time farms, having other obligations but to produce intensively, might be disadvantaged in terms of public transfers. Our hypothesis is that a higher degree of decoupling enables part-time farms to capture more easily direct payments than full-time farms. To test this, we do not use the usual approach of comparing several hypothetical policies in the same group of farmers, but we compare two existing policies in different countries: the largely <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> system in Switzerland where we expect that part-time farmers are rewarded by the system, and the rather production oriented payment system in France where we suspect a disincentive for off-farm work. FADN data were used, of 2003 for France and of 2004 for Switzerland. These were years where support in France was still strongly coupled to production activities, whereas the decoupled system of Switzerland was already in place. French data were linked with tax records to get information about off-farm incomes.

40|$|How {{agricultural}} policies {{affect the}} environment is within ecological economics. The EU Commission `Mid-Term Review of CAP of Agenda 2000 ' of July 2002 proposed to separate production from direct payments, so that farmers would fully compete in the market, without gearing production to the trade-distorting subsidies. The <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> to each farm will be conditional upon cross-compliance with the environmental, food safety, animal health and welfare, and occupational safety standards. MTR maintains extra set-aside payment for normal land to avoid overproduction, but no longer for marginal land. This paper suggests not to set aside normal land, because overproduction would be prevented by decoupling; normal land is less environmentally sensitive, and the direct payment would be enough for farmers {{to keep it in}} a good agricultural condition; setting-aside normal land would cost money, and make it unavailable for full-time farmers to achieve economies of scale. It recommends to set aside marginal land which is more environmentally sensitive, and the direct payment may not be enough for farmers to keep it in a good agricultural condition. It advises to gradually convert marginal land back to the nature forever, give a conversion payment to its owners to keep it in a good environmental condition, and pursue non-cereal agriculture and off-farm activities. It advocates a tax on those farmers who refuse to keep a good agricultural or environmental condition on the set aside or converted marginal land for maximally two years, and forced land sale afterwards, which would be less harsh than expropriation.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in the EU was a substantial {{change of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003. After <b>decoupling</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> from production, it has become evident, that distributional objectives are the major justification of farm payments. There are three facets: the distribution of payments among farmers within member states, the distribution of payments among member states, {{and the distribution of}} household incomes within member states. All of them will be affected if the volume and allocation of funds for the CAP will be changed in the new financial framework of the EU. The paper addresses the first distributional aspects. We provide an overview of the development of past and present research and findings on the distributional aspects of <b>direct</b> <b>payments.</b> We use the theory of federal fiscal relations to identify the policy agendas that should be handled at the EU level, at national levels, and at sub-national levels. We analyse how measures of concentration are affected if the criteria of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> are changed (e. g. a modified modulation scheme).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> paid to farm operators based on historical yields and base acreage, may lead to production distortions by altering a farmer's access to credit or enabling the farmer to receive more favorable credit terms. The authors estimate the impact of <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> under the 2002 Farm Bill on the credit terms of farm operators, specifically the interest rate on short-term operating loans. If farm operators are able to obtain more favorable credit terms and reduce their operating cost, then this offers an additional mechanism through which decoupled payments may distort current production. Design/methodology/approach – The authors estimate the impact of <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> on the interest rate on short-term operating loans. In the analysis, the authors control for farm financial characteristics, farm operator characteristics, and other factors. Data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey for the years 2005 - 2007, are used in the weighted regression analysis. Jackknifed standard errors are also computed. Findings – As the proportion of base acres to total operated acres increases it is found that interest rates decline by a small but statistically significant amount. This implies that <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> lead to lower operating costs through better credit terms. Research limitations/implications – Lower operating costs may in turn allow some farmers to expand production or produce on land that would otherwise be unprofitable to operate and hence left idle. Ultimately, this distorts current production. However, the small magnitude of the authors' results suggests that the reduction in interest rates, though positive, may have limited distortionary impacts. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence that decoupled payments alter a farm operator's credit terms and hence could lead to current production distortions. The paper contributes to the growing body of research investigating the mechanisms by which decoupled payments have the potential to distort current production.

The results indicate that the CAP reform currently does not increase the proportion of environmentally friendly production systems significantly. Cross Compliance is shown to have certain positive effects; it improves the control of environmentally damaging farm activities, in particular in the field of nitrate control. However, positive effects are limited and CC is often negatively associated with nature conservation. The results furthermore show that farms are affected varyingly by the CAP reform.

Results show that the decoupling schemes create a trade-off between the NCO’s and that adjustment reactions differ between farms depending on their legal form, size, and production. decoupling, multifunctionality, non-commodity outputs, modelling, simulation, policy analysis, ecological indicators, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|Abolishing {{a nearly}} 50 -year-old policy for rice price support, Korea adopted a new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> program in 2005. Making the {{transition}} to decoupled income payments has been governed by the need for operative and effective income safety nets and the WTO disciplines on domestic support. The program aims to deal with over-supply of rice while guarding against the threat of income insecurity. Integrated into a target price mechanism, the fixed and variable payments compensate part of farm income loss arising from adverse market conditions. Besides, the government launched a public stockholding measure to ensure food security. A review of previous studies highlights the fixed payment has no or at most minimal effects on production while the variable payment carries a fairly large effect on production. The share of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in agricultural budget accounts for only 8 percent in 2004 and thus the Korean government envisions greater use of decoupled income support. <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments,</b> <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> policy reform, rice, Korea, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
