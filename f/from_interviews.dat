5|$|Ballo's father wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's death, and refrained <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with the press until the book was {{published}} in 2009. Titled Kaja: 1988–2008, the book became a bestseller in Norway. It reached second place on the bestseller list of the Bestseller Association in Norway for general literature, in May 2009. The author stated he wrote the book as an expository method to both process his grief, inform his family about the controversy, and educate the public about suicide.|$|E
5|$|Weisman uses New York City as a {{model to}} outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He {{explains}} that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. <b>From</b> <b>interviews</b> {{with members of the}} Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.|$|E
5|$|George Smith's sister Anne {{married and}} had a son named James Christian McGill (1880–1972). McGill was {{orphaned}} {{at a young age}} when his parents died in the mid-1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by Mrs. Smith and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E

25|$|A user persona is a {{representation}} of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with users. They are captured in 1–2-page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. For each product, more than one persona is usually created, but one persona should always be the primary focus for the design.|$|E

25|$|When Testimony was {{published}} in the West in 1979, Shostakovich's overall anti-Stalinist tone and specific comments about the anti-totalitarian content hidden in the Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh Symphonies were held suspect initially. They were in some ways a complete about-face from the comments the West had received over the years, many times in the composer's words. Questions also arose over Solomon Volkov's role—to what degree he was a compiler of previously written material, a transcriber of the composer's actual words <b>from</b> <b>interviews,</b> or an author essentially putting words into the composer's mouth.|$|E
25|$|Data {{collected}} <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with physicians {{distinguishes between}} first impressions and intuition {{and contributes to}} understanding the occurrence of gut feelings in the medical field. Gut feelings go beyond first impressions: Physicians expressed feeling doubtful about their initial impressions as they gathered more data from their patients. More experienced physicians reported more instances of gut feelings than those less experienced, but {{the quality of the}} intuition was related to the quality of feedback received during the data collection process in general. Emotional engagement enhanced learning just as it does in first impressions.|$|E
25|$|Atlantic Productions, {{producers}} of BAFTA-nominated documentary , listed several discrepancies between Spielberg's film {{and the information}} it obtained <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with Mossad agents involved in the operation. It noted that the film suggests one group carried out almost all the assassinations, whereas in reality it was a much larger team. Mossad did not work with a mysterious French underworld figure as portrayed {{in the book and}} the film. The assassination campaign did not end because agents lost their nerve but because of the Lillehammer affair in which an innocent Moroccan waiter was killed. This is not mentioned in the film. The targets were not all directly involved in Munich, which Spielberg only acknowledges in the last five minutes.|$|E

25|$|The Cornerstone {{investigation}} spanned <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> {{with over}} 100 of Warnke's personal {{friends and acquaintances}} to his ministry's tax receipts. The investigation revealed a number of inaccuracies and evidence of fraud and deceit in Warnke's accounts. During the course of Cornerstones investigation, pictures of Warnke taken during {{the time he was}} alleged to be a Satanist priest were discovered. Rather than showing an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke as a typical 'square' of the mid-1960s. The investigation also revealed Warnke's claims that he and Charles Manson had attended a Satanic ritual to be false; Manson was in federal prison at the time, having no known ties to Satanic churches.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} information about the PAK FA and FGFA specifications yet, it is known <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> {{with people in the}} Russian Air Force that it will be stealthy, have the ability to supercruise, be outfitted with the next generation of air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ship missiles, and incorporate an AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar. The PAK FA/FGFA will use on its first flights 2 Saturn 117 engines (about 147.1kN thrust each). The 117 is an advanced version of the AL-31F, but built with the experience gained in the AL-41F programme. The AL-41F powered the Mikoyan MFI fighter (Mikoyan Project 1.44). Later versions of the PAK FA will use a completely new engine (107kN thrust each, 176kN in full afterburner), developed by NPO Saturn or FGUP MMPP Salyut.|$|E
25|$|Lane {{published}} {{an indictment of}} the Warren Commission, entitled Rush to Judgment, using these interviews as well as evidence from the 26 volumes of the Commission's report. Despite {{the fact that the}} majority of Mark Lane's material for his book came from the Warren Report itself, as well as <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> with those who were at the scene, sixteen publishers canceled contracts before Rush to Judgment was published. The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of the Warren Commission and {{remains one of the most}} remarkable books about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was adapted into a documentary film in 1966.|$|E

25|$|The Pythons Autobiography By the Pythons (2003), {{compiled}} <b>from</b> <b>interviews</b> {{with the}} surviving members, reveals that {{a series of}} disputes in 1998, over a possible sequel to Holy Grail that had been conceived by Idle, may {{have resulted in the}} group's permanent split. Cleese's feeling was that The Meaning of Life had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project {{for a variety of reasons}} (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the Grail and Brian films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance). Apparently, Idle was angry with Cleese for refusing to do the film, which most of the remaining Pythons thought reasonably promising (the basic plot would have taken on a self-referential tone, featuring them in their main 'knight' guises from Holy Grail, mulling over the possibilities of reforming their posse). The book also reveals that a secondary option around this point was the possibility of revitalising the Python brand with a new stage tour, perhaps with the promise of new material. This idea had also met with Cleese's refusal, this time with the backing of other members.|$|E
500|$|Research {{into the}} battle, and exactly who {{was inside the}} fortress, began when the Alamo fell and has {{continued}} with no signs of abatement.
