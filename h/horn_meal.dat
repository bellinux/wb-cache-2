40|$|Three biofertilizers (BF) {{and three}} plant strengtheners (PS) {{were tested in}} {{comparison}} to chemical fertilizer application and BABA (DL- 3 -amino-n-butanoic acid), respectively for their effects on the reactions of six different tomato varieties against three isolates of Phytophthora infestans in detached leaf disk assays. All experiments were repeated twice with six replicates each. Two of the BF (BioIlsa and Biofeed Quality) significantly reduced late blight severity as compared to <b>horn</b> <b>meal</b> and chemical fertilizer with no fertilizer by isolate and fertilizer by variety interactions. All PS significantly reduced susceptibility of all tomato varieties. However, the interactions among PS, variety and isolates were highly significant suggesting that different resistance mechanisms might {{be affected by the}} PS and BABA. Preliminary results indicate that the combined effects of PS and BF are additive without interactions...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho são apresentados os resultados preliminares obtidos com a aplicação de diferentes fertilizantes nitrogenados, a fim de se determinar a forma de nitrogênio preferida pelo arroz durante os dois primeiros meses do ciclo vegetativo. Para isso instalou-se uma experiência em vasos contendo terra-roxa misturada e empregando-se os seguintes materiais nitrogenados : salitre do Chile, sulfato de amónio, calciocianamida, uréia, torta de algodão, farinha de chifre e casco, e solução de amoníaco. Os resultados apontaram a uréia como o fertilizante que propiciou maior produção de matéria sêca. Seguiram-se-lhe o sulfato de amônio, solução de amoníaco, farinha de chifre e casco, calciocianamida, torta de algodão e, finalmente, o salitre. This paper {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} influence of several nitrogenous fertilizers on rice (Oryza sativa L.). The experiment was performed according to Mits-cherlich pot technique, and each treatment was replicated twice. The treatments tried and the total weight of the rice plants per pot, two monts after germination, are given below : Treatment Total weight (dry matter) of rice plant per pot (grams) 1. Check [...] 4. 5 2. PK without N. [...] 27. 0 3. PK + N (Sodium nitrate from Chile) [...] 21. 5 4. PK + N (Amonium sulfate) [...] 52. 5 5. PK + N (Calcium cyanamide) [...] - 27. 0 6. PK + N (Urea) [...] 62. 0 7. PK + N (Cotton seed meal) [...] 23. 5 8. PK + N (Hoof and <b>horn</b> <b>meal)</b> [...] 28. 0 9. PK + N (Amonia solution) [...] 37. 5 Treatment N. ° 1 did not receive any fertilizer. Treatment N. ° 2 received 2. 2 g of P 2 O 5 in the form of CaH 4 (PO 4) 2 and 3. 0 g of K 2 O in the form of K 2 SO 4, per pot, both in solution. Treatments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 received the same amount of phosphorus and potassium as N. ° 2, and the amount of the respective nitrogenous fertilizer corresponding to 1. 0 g of nitrogen per pot. The weight of the rice plants (leaves and stems) obtained for the different treatments indicated that urea was the most efficient source of nitrogen under the conditions of the experiment. After urea followed ammonium sulfate, ammonia in solution, hoof and <b>horn</b> <b>meal,</b> calcium cyanamide, cotton seed meal, and sodium nitrate from Chile. Calcium cyanamide impaired germination, and caused burning injury to the leaves that still was present two months after germination. The results obtained with hoof and <b>horn</b> <b>meal,</b> and cotton seed meal indicated that the nitrogen from these fertilizers becomes available in the soil rather rapidly. A comparison of the growth made by rice plants that were submitted to the different treatments is shown in figures 1 and 2, taken one and two months after germination. The numbers on the pots correspond to the treatment numbers as described above...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potentially}} mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) from six organic residues (OR), a laboratory aerobic incubation {{was conducted in}} a Cambic Arenosol, consisting of 6 treatments corresponding to: 0, 40, 80, 120, 160 or 200 kg N/ha. The OR tested were: municipal solid waste compost, secondary pulp mill sludge, <b>horn</b> <b>meal,</b> poultry manure, solid phase from pig slurry and composted pig manure. Mineral N evo-lution was determined at 9 sampling times. Two pot experiments with ryegrass (Lollium perenne L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L) were performed in the same soil to test the reliability of N fate predicted by incubation experiments. Only 80 and 160 kg N/ha treatments were tested, with or without mineral N ferti-lisation. Data from incubation experiments was very well fitted to the one pool kinetic model proposed by Stanford and Smith. The model showed a better fitting for the residues with {{a higher proportion of}} N recal-citrant compounds. Values of PMN (N 0) from the equations obtained by model fitting were well correlated to ryegrass and wheat N uptake. Poultry manure was the most efficient N supplier to crops...|$|E

40|$|Neste trabalho são apresentados os resultados obtidos em estudos preliminares sôbre a determinação da intensidade e evolução do fenômeno de amonificação e nitrificação em diversos fertilizantes nitrogenados, empregando-se terra roxa-misturada e os seguintes fertilizantes: sulfato de amônio, uréia, torta de mamona, farinha de sangue, farinha de chifres e cascos e calciocianamida. Os resultados obtidos permitem concluir que a calciocianamida foi o fertilizante que se amonificou mais intensamente, vindo a seguir a uréia, a torta de mamona, a farinha de sangue e, finalmente, a farinha de chifres e cascos. Já para o fenômeno de nitrificação, os resultados indicam a seguinte ordem decrescente: torta de mamona, uréia, farinha de chifres e cascos, farinha de sangue e sulfato de amônio. A calciocianamida, dosada no seu teor em nitrogênio nítrico, apresentou sempre traços, mostrando que foi praticamente nula a sua nitrificação no prazo de 40 dias de duração do ensaio. In {{this paper}} results {{obtained}} with {{the phenomenon of}} ammonification and nitrification in several nitrogen fertilizers are presented. The objective was {{the determination of the}} intensity and evolution of these phenomena. For this purpose an experiment was set up including the following nitrogenous fertilizers: ammonium sulfate, urea, castor bean cake, blood <b>meal,</b> <b>horn</b> and hoof <b>meal</b> and calciumcyanamide. The experiment was conducted during 40 days; after each ten days period, samples of the different treatments were taken and ammoniacal and nitric nitrogen were determined. The results obtained show that the calciumcyanamide fertilizer ammonified more intensively, being followed by urea, castor bean cake, blood <b>meal</b> and finally <b>horn</b> and hoof <b>meal.</b> On the other hand concerning the phenomenon of nitrification, the results indicate that the castor bean cake nitrified the most, being followed in descrescent order by urea, <b>horn</b> and hoof <b>meal,</b> blood meal and ammonium sulfate. Results of calciumcyanamide analyses always presented traces of nitric nitrogen, showing that practically no nitrification ocurred during the 40 days of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} of organic wastes as soil amendments is notably promoted in sustainable agricultural systems. However, for many animal by-products approved by organic farming regulations {{little is known}} about their effects on the greenhouse gas balance of the soil, in particular on N 2 O emissions. In this work we report on the N 2 O and CO 2 emissions from six animal-derived wastes (<b>horn</b> and hoof <b>meal,</b> blood meal, hydrolysed leather, meat bone meal, chicken manure and a commercial organic mixed fertiliser). We compared these emissions to those from a mineral fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) in a sandy and a loam soil during a three month laboratory incubation study. N 2 O flux dynamics varied strongly with residue category and soil type. In the sandy soil, cumulative N 2 O emissions correlated with soil NO 3 - content. Although the mineral fertiliser produced the highest total N 2 O emissions (5. 7 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil), the commercial organic fertiliser mixture led to statistically similar emissions (5. 3 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil). The other by-products emitted between 1. 3 – 3. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and only blood meal emitted less than 1 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil. In the loam soil, N 2 O emissions never exceeded 1. 0 mg N 2 O–N kg- 1 soil, and did not correlate with NO 3 - in soil. With regard to CO 2 emissions and C storage potential, chicken manure was the only residue that significantly accumulated C in both soils during the course of our experiment. The addition of an extra easily available source of C (glucose) or N (NO 3 -) influenced N 2 O emissions differently depending on the residue applied. Our results showed that despite the extra amount of C added with the organic amendments, N 2 O emissions from animal-derived wastes were never higher than those from the mineral fertilise...|$|R
