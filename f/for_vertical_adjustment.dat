50|$|In 2012 the TAC-50 A1 variant was introduced. The TAC-50 A1 {{has a new}} take-down {{fiberglass}} stock with a forend that is 5 in {{longer than}} the TAC-50 stock. This moves the balance point for the bipod forward. The stock includes an integral cheekpiece and a monopod on the buttstock with an option <b>for</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The stock incorporates a smaller pistol grip to fit {{a wider range of}} hand shapes, with and without gloves. The magazine release lever was repositioned ahead of the trigger bow to make the system easier to operate with gloved hands. For the A1 variant a new lighter bipod with legs that adjust vertically, as well as forward and rearward, to fine-tune the rifle for elevation was also developed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{measuring}} {{parts of}} short hollow cylinder are inner diameter, height and thickness. And the general equipment being used {{are all kinds}} of Vernier Calipers which all belong to the contact measuring. In this paper, Image-Based Distance Measuring System (IBDMS) is proposed for measuring the dimensions of short hollow cylinders with only one exposure. Because of a rise-down platform for camera positioning controlled device developed in this paper, the aforementioned measuring method can reduce expenses and processing time. As a result, maximal image contour of an unknown short hollow cylinder picture can be obtained so as to achieve measuring results with highest resolution at each time. To allow <b>for</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment,</b> we came up with a new method for distinguishing between vertical and non-vertical image contour region captured by video camera, resulting in better linear relation for transformation between pixel counts and distance. The measurement system not only increases the accuracy of the measuring results but also makes contributions for technicians or technical staffs to get accurate measuring results on unknown short hollow cylinders. Key-Words: circular plate of light transparent, gray scales concentric circle, short hollow cylinder. ...|$|E

40|$|Compliance with {{accounting}} standards {{is a major}} issue in Europe and elsewhere. Research on the horizontal dimension shows non-compliance even though financial reports state compliance and auditors concur. The vertical dimension is more relevant to discover the extent and reasons for non-compliance. Previous research shows that financial executives of multi-nationals indicated non-compliance when asked directly, even though financial reports and auditors state compliance. This follow-on study uses field-studies of subsidiaries of multi-nationals in three countries to explore the extent and reasons <b>for</b> non-compliance <b>for</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> when consolidating. The method of agreement and method of differences were used to analyse data. Results show substantial non-compliance and some reasons for non-compliance, notably income smoothing. The vertical dimension is appropriate for continued research and this study provides a model for similar research. {{accounting standards}} compliance; consolidated financial reporting; consolidation process; group accounting; subsidiary reporting; vertical adjustments; multinational subsidiaries; income smoothing. ...|$|R
5000|$|Another popular feature was the all-new convertible, {{where the}} trunklid would open {{electrically}} {{in a single}} piece, hinged {{at the back of}} the vehicle, then the fabric top would fold down and disappear beneath the trunklid. The mechanism was originally used on the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner hardtop convertible of the late 1950s. Opening the trunk on convertibles for storage required that the lid be opened electrically, without deploying or retracting the folding convertible top. Another feature was the popular [...] "Tilt-Away" [...] steering column, borrowed from the Thunderbird, that was modified to both adjust <b>for</b> <b>vertical</b> and length <b>adjustment.</b> [...] The 1961 model was the first car manufactured in the United States to be sold with a 24000 mi or 2-year bumper-to-bumper warranty.

50|$|The {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{range of a}} firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mils. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> range of 20 mils, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20 meters at 1000 meters (or 2 m at 100 m, 4 m at 200 m, 6 m at 300 m etc.). The {{horizontal and}} <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20 mils vertical and 10 mils horizontal adjustment. Elevation differ between models, but about 10-11 mils are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for long range shooting usually can have an adjustment range of 30-50 mils.|$|R
50|$|A {{milling machine}} built {{and used in}} the shop of Gay & Silver (aka Gay, Silver, & Co) in the 1830s was {{influential}} because it employed a better method of vertical positioning than earlier machines. For example, Whitney's machine (the one that Roe considered the very first) and others did not make provision <b>for</b> <b>vertical</b> travel of the knee. Evidently, the workflow assumption behind this was that the machine would be set up with shims, vise, etc. for a certain part design, and successive parts did not require <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> (or at most would need only shimming). This indicates that early thinking about milling machines was as production machines, not toolroom machines.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} into consolidated financial reporting of multinational companies {{has focused on}} horizontal adjustments, adjustments at the headquarters level to comply with accounting standards {{of the country where}} a stock exchange listing is made, e. g. US GAAP, or IFRS. An equally, if not more, important issue is <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> made by foreign subsidiaries when information is transmitted to the headquarters for consolidation. This study surveys all Swedish multinational companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, firstly in the early 1990 s and again some 10 years later to determine whether <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> were made as an indicator of compliance with Swedish accounting standards. The results indicate that while most Swedish multinational companies made <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments,</b> the large number that did not indicates a potentially high degree of non-compliance with accounting standards.

40|$|A new mode ofbeach {{response}} {{to changes in}} wave height is identified for reflective beaches where waves break close to the shoreline. This response involves <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the beach face morphology, especially the beach step. It is found that profile relief varies with wave height rather than inversely to it as expected from existing models. As a result the characteristic steep reflective profile can be maintained under certain conditions, during periods of beach erosion. A field program which included surveys of 67 beach profiles on a persistently reflective beach measured <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the beach step and as-sociated wave and sediment conditions. Based on these data a model is developed to des-cribe {{the changes in the}} amplitude ofthe beach step related to changes in breaker height and sediment size. It was found that as breaker height increases the step height increases, while the surf zone width remains constant. Larger grain sizes and changes in grain size across the beach face are also associated with larger step heights. This step adjustment model implies that if wave height increases, under the range ofconditions observed, the resultant increase in step amplitude and associated deepening of the nearshore will be sufficient to delay wave breaking, allowing a reflective profile to be maintained. Therefore the model can account for the environmental conditions which produce changes in step heights and favour the maintenance ofa reflective system. The model also implies that a threshold exists between this mode and the conventionally recognised mode ofbeach response and therefore differentiates between transient reflective profiles, and those of less mobile reflective beach systems.
