50|$|Selective content {{poisoning}} (also {{known as}} proactive or discriminatory content poisoning) attempts to detect copyright violators while allowing legitimate users {{to continue to}} enjoy the service provided by an open P2P network. The protocol identifies a peer with its endpoint address while the <b>file</b> <b>index</b> format is changed to incorporate a digital signature. A peer authentication protocol can then establish the legitimacy of a peer when she downloads and uploads files. Using identity based signatures, the system enables each peer to identify infringing users {{without the need for}} communication with a central authority. The protocol then sends poisoned chunks to these detected users requesting a copyright protected file only. If all legitimate users simply deny download requests from known infringers, the latter can usually accumulate clean chunks from colluders (paid peers who share content with others without authorization). However, this method of content poisoning forces illegitimate users to discard even clean chunks, prolonging their download time.|$|E
5000|$|The MUSIC/SP {{file system}} was unique {{in a number}} of respects. There was a single {{system-wide}} <b>file</b> <b>index.</b> The owner's userid and the file name were hashed to locate the file in this index, so any file on the system could be located with a single I/O operation. However, this presented a flat file system to the user. It lacked the directory structure commonly offered by DOS, Windows and Unix systems. In 1990 a [...] "tree-structured" [...] directory view of the file system was overlaid on this, bringing the system more in line with the file systems that were then available. By default the information stored in the files was compressed. This offered considerable saving in disk space. The file system had a fairly sophisticated access control scheme allowing the owner to control who could read, write, append to and execute the file. It also had the concept of a [...] "public" [...] file which was visible to all users and a [...] "private" [...] file which was only visible to the owner. In version 2.3, even private files were listed in the common library, with the result that no two users could have files under the same name; by 4.0, this limitation was removed.|$|E

We use clustering to automatically generate a content vocabulary. To avoid the problem of generating cluster centers that are overcrowded in high density areas for sparse data sets, we use a clustermerge procedure for cluster post-processing. We further use visual codewords to represent low level image features, which not only makes the inverted <b>file</b> <b>indexing</b> and search applicable to image content, but also helps bridge the gap between the low level image features and high-level human visual perception. Experimental results confirm the success of our methods. 1. Introduction and Relate...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The Web {{has become a}} vast {{information}} resource in recent years. Millions of people use the Web {{on a regular basis}} and the number is increasing rapidly. The Web is the largest center in the world presenting almost all of the social, economical, educational, etc. activities and anyone from all over the word can visit this huge place even though he does not have to stand up from his sit. Due to its hugeness, finding desired data on the Web in a timely and cost effective way is a problem of wide interest. In the last several years, many search engines have been created to help Web users find desired information. However, most of these search engines employ topic-independent search methods that rely heavily on keyword-based approaches where the users are presented with a lot of unnecessary search results. In this thesis, we present a data model using topic maps standards for Webbased information resources. In this model, topics, topic associations and topic occurrences (called as topic metalinks and topic sources in this study) are the fundamental concepts. In fact, the presented model is a metadata model that describes the content of the Web-based information resource and creates virtual knowledge maps over the modeled information resource. Thus, semantic indexing of the Web-based information resource is performed for allowing efficient search and querying the data on the resource. iv Additionally, we employ full text indexing in the presented model by using a widely accepted method that is inverted <b>file</b> <b>index.</b> Due to the rapid increase of data, the dynamic update of the inverted <b>file</b> <b>index</b> during the addition of new documents is inevitable. We have implemented an efficient dynamic update scheme in the presented model for the employed inverted <b>file</b> <b>index</b> method. The presented topic map data model provides combining the powers of both keyword-based search and topic-centric search methods. We also provide a prototype search engine verifying that our presented model contributes very much to the problem of efficient and effective search and querying of the Web-based information resources.
