5|$|In May 1942, Đurišić {{attacked}} and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro.</b> In June 1942, Đurišić {{collaborated with the}} Ustaše in Foča in south-eastern Bosnia. After being forced out of Serbia by the Germans, Mihailović arrived <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro</b> as the Italians and Chetniks were fighting the Partisans. Mihailović was accompanied by his staff and a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) liaison officer. He eventually established his base {{in the village of}} Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from Đurišić's headquarters at Kolašin. Mihailović and his staff had few troops and relied on Đurišić for protection. Soon after Mihailović arrived <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> Đurišić told Mihailović's SOE liaison officer that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailović. Đurišić and the other Chetnik commanders <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro</b> nominally recognised Mihailović as their supreme commander but they rarely obeyed him.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, Nedić {{sent the}} 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK to Montenegro to {{supplement}} Đurišić's forces. In {{the first half}} of 1944, the Germans <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro</b> and the Sandžak organised offensives against the Partisans, largely relying on forces under the command of Lašić and Đurišić. Because of the weakness of their own forces, the Germans contributed by commanding and supplying the troops involved, and providing smaller mobile armoured units with heavy weapons. The Chetnik leaders provided most of the troops. In February and March, the Germans and numerous Chetnik units undertook a series of operations codenamed Bora, Baumblüte and Vorfrühling around Podgorica.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav People's Army took {{thousands}} of prisoners {{during the war}} in Croatia, and interned them in camps in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. The Croatian forces also captured some Serbian prisoners, and the two sides agreed to several prisoner exchanges; most prisoners were freed by the end of 1992. Some infamous prisons included the Sremska Mitrovica camp, the Stajićevo camp, and the Begejci camp in Serbia, and the Morinj camp <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro.</b> The Croatian Army also established detention camps, such as the Lora prison camp in Split.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. <b>In</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of an Axis puppet-state known as the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed on 12 July 1941. The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljević and his supporters. By 13 July, this proclamation prompted the outbreak of an anti-Italian uprising <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro</b> led by local communists (Partisans) and Serb nationalists (Chetniks). Having assumed power the previous day, Drljević established the Provisional Administrative Committee of Montenegro, a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire. He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans. In September, he was dismissed from office by the Italians.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar <b>in</b> <b>Montenegro,</b> a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
