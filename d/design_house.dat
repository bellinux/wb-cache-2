5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German <b>design</b> <b>house</b> Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
25|$|A typical German fachwerk <b>design</b> <b>house,</b> with a porch roof parapet, gable-end chimneys, and a {{decorative}} wood balustrade. This was built c. 1870 for German watchmaker-stonemason Ludwig Schneider. Louis Priess owned the house 1883–1890. Arthur Klingelhoefer {{bought the house}} in 1924 {{and a year later}} resided in it until his death in 1947.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th {{century the}} best work is {{undoubtedly}} to {{be found on the}} Continent. France, Germany and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered American continent was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and {{hand in hand with the}} spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. Pilasters took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of <b>design.</b> <b>House</b> fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in Bishopsgate, but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a good example of decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, Bristol. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that Jacobean form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which is at once as decorative as it is simple.|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 79 - 81). This {{exploratory study}} aimed {{to investigate the}} role that <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> play in the Cape Town clothing value chain of production. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} key informants, buyers in clothing retail companies, heads of design rooms in <b>design</b> <b>houses,</b> and homeworkers. Findings reveal that <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> act as intermediaries between retailers and clothing manufacturers or between retailers and homeworkers. In their latter role <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> are forging links between the informal and formal clothing economy. As in buyer-driven chains of production, retailers in the clothing value chain wield a substantial amount of power in determining prices. It was found that <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> are not completely powerless in their relationship with retailers, in fact, they posses knowledge that enables them to bargain over prices. The relationship between <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> and homeworkers was found to be an oppressive one, with homeworkers possessing little to no bargaining power. The {{increase in the number of}} <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> in Cape Town has assisted in the survival of the industry in the face of a number of difficulties. The continued presence of <b>design</b> <b>houses</b> creates the potential for development in the industry...|$|R

Chapman has suggested that the sequence is {{a significant part of the}} James Bond mythos because it [...] "foregrounds the motif of looking" [...] that is central to the spy film genre. [...] The gun barrel imagery sometimes carried over to the film posters used to promote Bond films, including as a familiarising element on the introduction of Timothy Dalton for The Living Daylights.|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{her acting}} work, Kapoor has {{established}} {{a career as a}} designer and an author.

Following the end of her contract with Globus, she expressed a desire to work with a <b>design</b> <b>house</b> to release her clothing line internationally, but later explained that those plans were on hold.|$|E
500|$|The September 12, 2009 {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Fantasies. It was announced {{to be in}} production on April 15, 2010, and made available for pre-order.

2500|$|Zaitsev often {{complained to}} the Soviet {{authorities}} {{about the lack of}} essential materials for his craft, which The New York Times noted in 1988 that he [...] "until recently" [...] was forced to use dressmaker's mannequins from World War II. Zaitsev signed a three-year contract with Intertorg Inc. in August 1987, which saw Dom Modi selling its designs in the United States, with profits going to the <b>design</b> <b>house</b> rather than the Soviet Treasury. The contract was the first commercial consumer venture signed between the two countries. In October 1987 he showed his collection at the iconic Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, which critics called overwrought, out-of-date and reminiscent of Western fashion from several seasons earlier. Undiscouraged, Zaitsev said that he planned to return with a [...] "pared-down, sexier collection". He returned to New York City in 1988 where he designed costumes for the musical revue Sophisticated Ladies, based on the music of Duke Ellington. Participation in his first Paris fashion shows came in January 1988 at the invitation of Madame Carven, whom Zaitsev met in Moscow in December 1987, showing his collection under the banner of [...] "Russian Seasons". He also joined the Maison de Couture and was made an honorary citizen of Paris, by then Mayor Jacques Chirac. The following year in March, Maison de Couture named Zaitsev as [...] "Man of the Year in the World of Fashion" ...|$|E
