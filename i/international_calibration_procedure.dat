40|$|<b>International</b> audienceA new <b>calibration</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{proposed}} for a stereovision setup. It uses {{the object of}} interest as the calibration target, provided the observed surface has a known de nition (e. g., its CAD model). In a rst step, the transformation matrices needed for the calibration of the setup are determined assuming that the object conforms to its CAD model. Then the 3 D shape of the surface of interest is evaluated by deforming the a priori given freeform surface. These two steps are performed via an integrated approach to stereoDIC. The measured 3 D shape of a machined Bézier patch is validated against data obtained by a coordinate measuring machine. The feasibility of the calibration method's application to large surfaces is shown with the analysis of a 2 -m 2 automotive roof panel...|$|R

An initial {{reconstruction of the}} sample is positioned in the 3 D space for every angle so that its projection matches the initial one. This procedure allows a space-time displacement field to be estimated for the scanned sample, which is regularized with i) rigid body motions in space and ii) modal time shape functions computed using model reduction techniques (i. e., proper generalized decomposition). The result is an accurate identification {{of the position of}} the sample adapted for each angle, which may deviate from the desired perfect rotation required for standard reconstructions. An application of this procedure to a 4 D in situ mechanical test is shown. The proposed correction leads to a much improved tomographic reconstruction quality...|$|R

This methodology overcomes the problems of common calibration methods when they are used to determine the densities of high density and high viscosity fluids such as RTILs. The methodology is applied for the precise density determination of RTILs 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Emim][BF 4], 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Bmim][BF 4], 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Hmim][BF 4], and 1 -octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [Omim][BF 4] in the temperature and pressure intervals (283. 15 to 323. 15) K and (0. 1 to 60) MPa, respectively. The viscosities of these substances, needed for the estimation of the viscosity-induced errors, were estimated at the same conditions from the experimental measurements in the intervals (283. 15 to 323. 15) K and (0. 1 to 14) MPa and from a specific extrapolation procedure. The uncertainty in the density measurements was estimated in ± 0. 30 kg * m- 3 which is an excellent value in the working intervals. The results of these RTILs have demonstrated that viscosity-induced errors are relevant and they {{must be taken into account}} for a precise density determination. Finally, an alternative tool for a simpler application of this procedure is presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>calibration</b> of the multistatic {{scattering}} matrix {{plays an important}} part in the construction of a quantitative microwave imaging system. For scattering measurement applications, the calibration must be performed on the amplitude and on the phase of the fields of interest. When the antennas are not completely identical, as for example with a multiplexed antennas array, a specific <b>calibration</b> <b>procedure</b> must be constructed. In the present work, we explain how a complex calibration matrix can be defined which takes advantage of the geometrical organization of the antennas. Indeed, for arrays of antennas positioned on a circle, the inherent symmetries of the configuration can be fully exploited by means of an adequate reorganization of the multistatic {{scattering matrix}}. In addition, the reorganization permits to detect antenna pairs which are not properly functioning and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceA delayed-mode <b>calibration</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{presented}} {{to improve the quality}} of hydrographic data from CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDL) deployed on elephant seals. This procedure is applied on a dataset obtained with 10 CTD-SRDLs deployed at Kerguelen Islands in 2007. A comparison of CTD-SRDLs with a ship-based CTD system is first presented. A pressure-effect correction, linear with pressure, is deduced for both temperature and salinity measurements. An external field effect on the conductivity sensor is also detected, inducing an additional salinity offset. The salinity offset cannot be estimated directly from the ship-based CTD comparisons, because the attachment of the CTD-SRDL on the seal head modifies the magnitude of the external field effect. Two methods are proposed for estimating a posteriori the salinity offset. The first method uses the stable salinity maximum characterizing the Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), sampled by seals foraging south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. Where this approach is not possible, a statistical method of cross-comparison of CTD-SRDLs surface salinity measurements is used over the sluggish Northern Kerguelen Plateau. Accuracies are respectively estimated as +/- 0. 02 degrees C for temperature and +/- 0. 1 for derived salinity without corrections. The delayed-mode calibration significantly improves the CTD-SRDL data, improving accuracies to +/- 0. 01 degrees C and +/- 0. 03, respectively. A better salinity accuracy of +/- 0. 02 is achieved when the LCDW method can be used. For CTD-SRDLs where ship-based CTD comparisons are not available, the expected accuracy would be +/- 0. 02 degrees C for temperature and +/- 0. 04 for the derived salinity...|$|R
