40|$|Over {{the last}} years a growing demand for ratite meat, {{including}} ostrich, emu, and rhea has been observed in the world. Ratite meat is recognised as a <b>dietetic</b> <b>product</b> because of low level of fat, high share of PUFA, favourable n 6 /n 3 ratio, and higher amounts of iron content in comparison with beef and chicken meat. The abundance of bioactive compounds, e. g. PUFA, makes ratite meat highly susceptible to oxidation processes. Moreover, pH over 6 creates favourable environment for fast microbial growth during storage conditions affecting its shelf life. However, availability of information on ratite meat shelf life among consumers and industry is still limited. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present review is to provide current information about the effect of ratite meat packaging type, i. e. air packaging, vacuum packaging with skin pack, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on its shelf life quality during storage, including technological and nutritional properties...|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} {{the concentrations of}} cadmium, lead, mercury, and metalloid arsenic in the samples of some <b>dietetic</b> <b>products</b> marketed in Croatia, and to compare the values obtained with maximum allowed amounts (MAA) according to the law. Methods. Metal and metalloid concentrations were measured in 30 <b>dietetic</b> <b>products</b> from the group of industrial food supplements and food additives. The measurements were performed by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic were compared with the maximum allowed amounts for these substances in corn and corn products, and their estimated daily intake with {{the recommendations of the}} World Health Organization. Results. Two out of 30 samples contained cadmium, 5 samples contained lead, and as many as 16 samples contained mercury in concentrations exceeding maximum allowed amounts. The concentration of arsenic was below maximum allowed amount in all samples. In total, the concentrations of metals exceeding maximum allowed amount were found in 17 out of 30 samples. Extremely high contamination with heavy metals was detected in a sample based on zinc oxide, in which the concentration of cadmium (0. 418 mg/kg) was four times higher than the maximum allowed amount, and of lead (6. 074 mg/kg) 15 times higher than the maximum allowed amount. The highest concentration of mercury (1. 117 mg/kg), 35 -fold maximum allowed amount, was found in a ginseng-based sample. Conclusions. Cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic were present in some <b>dietetic</b> <b>products</b> in concentrations exceeding maximum allowed amounts. <b>Dietetic</b> <b>products</b> control should match respective legal provisions of the European Union requirements, and requires continual monitoring...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{growing demand for}} ratite meat, {{including}} ostrich, emu, and rhea has been observed all over the world. However, consumers {{as well as the}} meat industry still have limited and scattered knowledge about this type of meat, {{especially in the case of}} emu and rhea. Thus, the aim of the present review is to provide information on technological and nutritional properties of ostrich, emu, and rhea meat, including carcass composition and yields, physicochemical characteristics, and nutritive value. Carcass yields and composition among ratites are comparable, with the exception of higher content of fat in emu. Ostrich, emu, and rhea meat is darker than beef and ratite meat acidification is closer to beef than to poultry. Ratite meat can be recognised as a <b>dietetic</b> <b>product</b> mainly because of its low level of fat, high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), favourable n 6 /n 3 ratio, and high iron content in comparison with beef and chicken meat. Ratite meat is also rich in selenium, copper, vitamin B, and biologically active peptides such as creatine (emu) and anserine (ostrich), and has low content of sodium (ostrich).

40|$|AbstractThe food style {{defines the}} {{behaviour}} {{of the consumer}} or the behaviour of a community function to the wishes and the significances regarding the food act; these are {{closely linked to the}} procurement, preparation and consumption of food. The impact of education on the consumers of animal origin food products was evaluated using a questionnaire structured on three categories of respondents: pupils, students and adults; all residents of the Timis County- Romania. The findings indicate a preference for meat of 98 % of the respondents; mainly chicken, then pork and beef. The high percentage of milk consume is influenced by tradition, the age of the respondents and the reasonable price. Students prefer pork and meat products, followed by dairy products. Adults prefer chicken meat mainly due to its low price, or because it can be obtained in their own household. Beef is considered a <b>dietetic</b> <b>product</b> and does not have a high percentage in the consumers’ preferences, as the tradition and the education received do not recommend it. The meat products are not in the preferences of the respondents with high school education, this place being occupied by milk and eggs obtained in individual farms. A rational diet implies the consumption of all food groups in balanced proportions, function to the age, daily activity and health state.

In addition, fructose is the predominant sugar in date syrup, which elevates blood glucose {{at a slower pace}} than the other types of sugar. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the glycemic response of healthy persons to dietetic sour cherry jam prepared with date syrup. Methods: In this clinical trial, the glycemic response of 9 healthy persons was evaluated after the consumption of two kinds of jams, one prepared with date syrup and one as a control. Both jams had been produced using a specific formulation. White bread was chosen as the reference food. Having determined the glycemic index (GI) of the two jams, glycemic load (GL) was calculated and compared for the two jams by independent t-test. Results: GL was 15. 4 and 18 for the dietetic and control jams respectively, both of which were within the permitted range for diabetic's consumption. No significant difference was observed between the GIs of the two jams. The results showed that, the GL of the dietetic jam was significantly lower than that of the control (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The GL of the dietetic jam prepared with date syrup was less than that of the control sample. In light of the other health benefits of date syrup, once confirmed by further studies, this jam may be suitable to be introduced to the public as a <b>dietetic</b> <b>product.</b> Keywords: Diabetes mellitus, Date s, Glycemic index, Glycemic loa...|$|E

40|$|Although chicken meat is {{considered}} to be a <b>dietetic</b> <b>product,</b> new technologies are developed that alter its nutritive composition in order to reduce the cholesterol level and change the ratio of essential fatty acids. ese technologies are ex-pected to have positive impacts on human health. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those from n- 3 group, become very important for nutritionists because they play a significant role in prevention of stress induced diseases and of those induced by improper diets (Barlow and Pike, 1991; Albrecht and Klein, 1995). Polyunsaturated n- 3 fatty acids decrease the risk of heart diseases and psoriasis. Moreover, they are necessary for normal develop-ment of brain and nerve tissue (Leaf and Weber, 1988; Barlow and Pike, 1991). Altering the fat composition in broiler diets by inclusion of some feeds results in so called “designed ” meat, rich in n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as α-lino-lenic (C 18 : 3 n- 3), eicosapentaenoic (C 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6 n- 3), as stated by Haumann (1993). Plant sources of fats, rich in n- 3 fatty acids, are added to broiler diets in order to improve the fatty acid profile of meat and eggs, keeping in mind the satisfactory flavour of the same product (Chanmugam et al., 1992; Ajuyah et al., 1993). e seed of flax and some grasses is rich in α-lino-lenic and linoleic fatty acids while sunflower seed is rich in linoleic acid. Rape seed contains consider-able amounts of α-linolenic and linoleic fatty acids too, therefore it is used as a source of protein and energy for broiler diets in many countries. e possibilities of increasing the α-linolenic fatty acid content using rape products were demonstrated by researches of Zollitsch et al. (1993), Lettner and Zollitsch (1993), Kralik et al. (1997) and Lopez-Ferrer et al. (1997).
