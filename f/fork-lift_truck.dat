500|$|During Family Guys third season, {{the show}} was {{cancelled}} by its network. In preparation in case {{the show was}} revived and began broadcasting again, five short scripts were written in 2001 for future episodes. Blind Ambition was developed {{from one of those}} scripts. A number of scenes in the episode were removed before broadcast and one, the reappearance of Ernie the Giant Chicken, had originally been set to broadcast in [...] "The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire". The scene was moved to this episode because [...] "The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire" [...] already contained a lengthy fight sequence and overran its time allowance. Several of the removed scenes focused on gags showing Peter and his friends attempting to rehabilitate Quagmire, one of which saw Brian Griffin transporting a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> load of porn magazines away from Quagmire's house.

50|$|Set in {{the small}} village of Maaskantje in North Brabant, a group of friends: Gerrie, Richard, Rikkert, Robbie and Barrie lose their jobs. The group {{perceives}} themselves as being victims of the widely reported credit crisis, although in actuality their misfortune is {{the direct result of}} their idleness, lack of common sense, and poor punctuality. Gerrie, for instance, turns up to work late and drives the forks of his <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> into a pallet of boxed plasma screen televisions.

Irish, she had a Firbankian wit and a lovely turn of phrase. ‘Do you know the Atlantic at all?’ she once asked me and I put the line into Habeas Corpus and got a big laugh on it. From a grand Irish family she was quite snobbish; talking of someone she said: ‘Then he married a Mitford … but that’s a stage {{everybody}} goes through.’ Even the most ordinary remark would be given her own particular twist and she could be quite camp.

50|$|Flatbeds became {{rare in the}} 1980s as the {{majority}} of road freight changed to either containers or pallet loads carried on larger and more efficient trucks, optimised for quicker loading by <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> Containers are carried on specialised semi-trailers with twistlocks in the corners to retain the container. Pallet loads are carried in either box bodies, loaded through rear doors, or curtain-sided bodies loaded through the sides. Both of these protect loads from the weather and can be quickly loaded with standard loads, but are more restrictive for single bulky loads, loaded by crane. The haulage and logistics business also changed {{around the same time}} as a greater proportion became more regular in nature, such as standard daily loads of equally-sized boxes from a distribution centre to a supermarket, rather than the unpredictable ad hoc nature or earlier road transport.|$|R

Fix-bodied trucks loaded and unloaded by <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> could not move fast enough. Depots were too cramped to outload at the pace required and stocks on the ground could not be moved sufficiently quickly to meet the predicted pace of battle. Productivity fell: instead of the two-to-three round trips a day envisaged often only one could be achieved with {{the remainder of the}} time spent queueing. Finally, the rail outloading system from the ammunition depots along the Rhine could not meet the challenge and railheads capable of providing sufficient space to offload trains using conventional materiel handling equipment were limited and vulnerable.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Park Royal, then {{a part of}} Middlesex, Devonshire {{had been}} a schoolboy footballer but had been turned away by Crystal Palace at age 14 for being too small. He {{returned}} to Selhurst Park two years later and played a couple of youth team games but was again released by the club, this time by former West Ham player and Palace manager, Malcolm Allison. Devonshire started playing for non-league Southall {{and in doing so}} {{came to the attention of}} league clubs such as Reading, Southampton, and Brentford. By day he worked as a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> driver at the Hoover Factory in Perivale, Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United scouts, Eddie Baily and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood. Devonshire signed for West Ham United in 1976 for a fee of £5,000, a transfer which has led to him being referred to as [...] "West Ham's best ever buy".|$|E

Dicks attended Novers Lane Primary School, in Knowle, Bristol and Merrywood Boys Secondary School also in Knowle. At aged 11 he was watched by former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Bill Nicholson who was scouting for West Ham United but turned down as he [...] "was not quick enough". At aged 13 he was spotted playing by Ron Veal who was scouting for Aston Villa. Veal recommended him to Villa manager, Ron Saunders, however Saunders lost his job at Villa on 9 February 1982.

50|$|Born in Liverpool, Moore {{worked as}} a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> driver and {{part-time}} musician. He first played drums with the Silver Beetles in May 1960, {{at the suggestion of}} Allan Williams, and later that month travelled to Scotland with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe, when they acted as a backing band for singer Johnny Gentle. During the tour, he was injured and lost his front teeth when the band's van, driven by Johnny Gentle, had a minor accident. However, Lennon and the Scottish organiser of the tour took him out of hospital and insisted that he perform {{with the rest of the}} group. After they returned to Liverpool, Moore had already decided that he had 'had enough of Lennon'; When he didn't appear for a gig one night, the rest of the band went round to his flat, and were told by his girlfriend that he had gone back to his steady job at the bottle works. When they tried to persuade her otherwise, she apparently said 'you can all piss off!'. He undertook one further performance with the group, before they left for Germany with Pete Best as their drummer in August 1960.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the main {{characteristics}} of the working condition on the vibration exposure on <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> Four hundred and eighty recordings were made on five trucks equipped with four different types of tyres and a 'normal' or an 'anti-vibration' seat, driven while empty or loaded, on a smooth or a rough track by three workers. An analysis of variance was performed to study the main effects and the significant interactions between these factors. A mathematical model is proposed for the weighted acceleration on the floor and on the seat in the vertical axis. This shows quantitatively that the vibration exposure is mainly influenced by the roughness of the track, the speed {{and the quality of the}} seat. Inflated tyres are preferable when an anti-vibration seat with a very low resonance frequency is used. In other cases, cushion tyres are more indicated...|$|R
50|$|From {{the youth}} hostel of Westturm {{there is a}} good all-round view of the whole route and in the high season you can see a lot of activity. For example, there are often two trains {{underway}} at the same time, which cross one another immediately in front of the pier. There are also services via Saline to Westen as required, but these are not open to the general public and mainly serve the schools field centre there. The majority of trains also haul eight-wheeled flat wagons for the transportation of luggage. The suitcases and bags that are handed in are transported in roll containers on the flats, as are bicycles. Food and all sorts of other goods to supply the island's needs are also carried. Furniture and other removal items are usually carried on the flats in small containers. These are cross-loaded to trailers with <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> and delivered to the owners using electric vans. There are also several eight-wheeled, open wagons.|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{different}} {{backup power}} systems for uninterruptible {{emergency power supply}} (UPS) in the kW-power range.
