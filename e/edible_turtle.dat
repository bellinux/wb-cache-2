Description {{of a big}} <b>edible</b> <b>turtle</b> living in the Savannah and Alatamaha rivers, {{as well as the}} rivers of East Florida. In the handwriting of an amanuensis, except for the address on the last page ('Sir Charles von Linné Archiater to His Majesty the King of Sweden & Knight of the Polar Star'), which is probably in Alexander Garden's hand. See letter from Alexander Garden to Carl Linnaeus, 20 June 1771 n. s., "The Linnaean correspondence", linnaeus. c 18. net, letter L 4515. In his annotated copy of Linné, C. v.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of {{some or all}} of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) were determined in the livers and kidneys of 50 stranded sea turtles (38 Chelonia mydas, eight Caretta caretta, three Eretmochelys imbricata, one Lepidochelys olivacea) from the Moreton Bay region of south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Concentrations of Cd, Se and Zn in the kidney tended to decrease with age, whereas {{concentrations of}} Zn in the liver tended to increase. Concentrations of Cd in all sea turtle species (1. 7 - 75. 9 mu g g super(- 1) wet weight) were amongst the highest recorded for marine vertebrates globally. Although there was no obvious association between metal concentrations and particular diseases in C. mydas, the high concentrations of Cd found in <b>edible</b> <b>turtle</b> tissues may pose a threat to the health of indigenous people whose diet includes C. mydas...|$|E
