40|$|Abstract. Four {{new species}} of feather mites {{belonging}} to three different genera of the family Pteronyssidae are described from passerine birds of South Africa: Pteroherpus africanus sp. n. from the <b>garden</b> <b>bulbul</b> Pycnonotus barbatus (Desfontaines) (Pycnonotidae), Pteroherpus cysticolae sp. n. from the wing-snapped cisticola Cisticola ayresii Hartlaub (Sylviidae), Pteronyssoides promeropis sp. n. from the Gurneyâ€™s sugarbird Promerops gurneyi Verreaux (Promeropidae), and Sturnotrogus creatophorae sp. n. from the wattled starling Creatophora cinerea Menschen (Sturnidae). A brief review of recent publications on the taxonomy of the family Pteronyssidae is given. The present paper continues the series of our publications dedicated to feather mites associated with South African passerines (Mironov and Kopij 1966 a, b, 1997, 2000) and includes descriptions of four new feather mite species of the family Pteronyssidae Oudemans, 1941. The family Pteronyssidae currently includes 18 genera and about 130 described species. The representatives of this family are mostly associated with different bird families of Piciformes and Passeri-formes and only one genus, Cleyastobius Gaud, 1981, occurs on the wooden hoopoes Phoeniculidae (Coracii-formes). A detailed generic revision of the family Pteronyssidae (considered in a status of subfamily) {{was carried out by}} Faccini and Atyeo (1981). A review of species associated with birds of the orders Piciforme...|$|E
