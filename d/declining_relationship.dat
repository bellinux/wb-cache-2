40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of low- and medium resolution spectra of the very fast nova, Nova Cygni 2001 / 2 (V 2275 Cyg) obtained at nine epochs in August, September and October, 2001. The expansion velocity from hydrogen Balmer lines {{is found to be}} 2100 km/s, although early H-alpha profile showed a weak feature at - 3500 km/s, too. The overall appearance of the optical spectrum is dominated by broad lines of H, He and N, therefore, the star belongs to the ``He/N'' subclass of novae defined by Williams (1992). Interstellar lines and bands, as well as BV photometry taken from the literature yielded to a fairly high reddening of E(B-V) = 1. 0 +/- 0. 1 mag. The visual light curve was used to deduce M_V by the maximum magnitude versus rate of <b>decline</b> <b>relationship.</b> The resulting parameters are: t_ 0 = 2452141. 4 (+ 0. 1) (- 0. 5), t_ 2 = 2. 9 +/- 0. 5 days, t_ 3 = 7 +/- 1 days, M_V=- 9. 7 +/- 0. 7 mag.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of the unusual optical transient SN 2010 U, including spectra taken 1. 03 days to 15. 3 days after maximum light that identify it as a fast and luminous Fe II type nova. Our multi-band light curve traces the fast decline (t_ 2 = 3. 5 days) from maximum light (M_V = - 10. 2 mag), placing SN 2010 U in the top 0. 5 % of the most luminous novae ever observed. We find typical ejecta velocities of approximately 1100 km/s and that SN 2010 U shares many spectral and photometric characteristics with two other fast and luminous Fe II type novae, including Nova LMC 1991 and M 31 N- 2007 - 11 d. For the extreme luminosity of this nova, the maximum magnitude vs. rate of <b>decline</b> <b>relationship</b> indicates a massive white dwarf progenitor with a low pre-outburst accretion rate.

40|$|Worldwide {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the main drivers of biodiversity decline. Effective conservation strategies depend on the type of relationship between biodiversity and land-use intensity, but to date the shape of this relationship is unknown. We linked plant species richness with nitrogen (N) input as an indicator of land-use intensity on 130 grasslands and 141 arable fields in six European countries. Using Poisson regression, we found that plant species richness was significantly negatively related to N input on both field types after the effects of confounding environmental factors had been accounted for. Subsequent analyses showed that exponentially <b>declining</b> <b>relationships</b> provided a better fit than linear or unimodal relationships and that this was largely the result of the response of rare species (relative cover less than 1 %). Our results indicate that conservation benefits are disproportionally more costly on high-intensity than on low-intensity farmland. For example, reducing N inputs from 75 to 0 and 400 to 60  kg ha− 1  yr− 1 resulted in about the same estimated species gain for arable plants. Conservation initiatives are most (cost-) effective if they are preferentially implemented in extensively farmed areas that still support high levels of biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{iron and}} lead promote {{oxidative}} damage, and hemochromatosis (HFE) gene polymorphisms increase body iron burden, HFE variant alleles may modify the lead burden and cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>relationship.</b> OBJECTIVE: Our {{goal was to}} assess the modifying effects of HFE variants on the lead burden and cognitive decline relation in older adults. METHODS: We measured tibia and patella lead using K-X-ray fluorescence (1991 – 1999) among participants of the Normative Aging Study, a longitudinal study of community-dwelling men from greater Boston. We assessed cognitive function with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) twice (1993 – 1998 and 1995 – 2000) and genotyped participants for HFE polymorphisms. We estimated the adjusted mean differences in lead-associated annual cognitive decline across HFE genotype groups (n = 358). RESULTS: Higher tibia lead was associated with steeper cognitive decline among participants with at least one HFE variant allele compared with men with only wild-type alleles (p interaction = 0. 03), such that a 15 µg/g increase in tibia lead was associated with a 0. 2 point annual decrement in MMSE score among HFE variant allele carriers.

40|$|The {{arrival of}} a couple’s first baby brings a {{combination}} of excitement and often some apprehension for the couple. The demands of being a parent are considerable, and often reduce the opportunity for the spouses to have quality time together. About 50 % of new parent couples report a moderate to large decline in relationship satisfaction {{in the first year}} after the birth of their child. <b>Declining</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction is associated with a variety of negative individual (e. g., psychological distress, and poor health for child and parent) and relationship (e. g., couple conflict, parent-child relationship) outcomes. The current study tested whether an index of risk and observed communication behaviour predicted the trajectory of couples’ relationship satisfaction across the transition to parenthood. Consistent with predictions, high risk predicted more decline in relationship satisfaction across the first two and half years after the birth of their first child. However, couple communication was not reliably related to the trajectory of relationship satisfaction, except that high positive affect predicted less decline in males relationship satisfaction. However even this effect disappeared once risk was entered into the equation as a control variable. Routine screening of new parent couples for risk of <b>declining</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction could allow selective offering of educational programs to assist couples adjust to parenthood successfully...|$|E

40|$|A {{report on}} the spectroscopic and multi-color {{photometric}} observations of high galactic latitude classical nova KT Eridani (Nova Eridani 2009) is presented. After 12. 2 days from maximum light, broad and prominent emission lines of Balmer series, He I, He II, N II, N III and O I {{can be seen on}} the spectra. The FWHM of Hα line yields an expansion velocity of approximately 3400 km s^- 1. After 279. 4 days from maximum light, we can see prominent emission lines of He II and [O III] on the spectrum. Among them, [O III] (4959, 5007) lines show multiple peaks. From the obtained light curve, KT Eri is classified to be a very fast nova, with a decline rate by two magnitude of 6. 2 ± 0. 3 days and three of 14. 3 ± 0. 7 days. We tried to estimate the absolute magnitude (M_V) using the Maximum Magnitude versus Rate of <b>Decline</b> <b>relationship</b> and distance of KT Eri. The calculated M_V is approximately - 9.

The cohort consisted of men (n = 903) and women (n = 1, 673) over age 65 years in two rural Iowa counties who were interviewed in 1982 {{and again in}} 1985. Three separate measures of social relationships were dichotomized into lower and higher levels and included the number of close friends and relatives (less than three vs. three or more), church attendance (less than once per month {{or not at all}} vs. once per month or more), and membership in a group (nonmember vs. member). Those with higher social relationship levels at both interviews were compared with those who had higher levels at baseline but lower levels at follow-up (i. e., a <b>decline</b> in social <b>relationship</b> level) using logistic regression. In multivariate analysis, important baseline predictors of <b>decline</b> in social <b>relationship</b> levels included greater age, lower educational level, lower memory test score, the presence of physical disabilities, and a higher level of depressive symptoms.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between parental income {{and the level}} of educational attainment of children is controversial. Some argue that a direct relationship exists and others that unobserved factors correlated with both income and attainment drive the relationship. This paper explores the {{relationship between}} income and the intra-household dispersion of education attainment among children. We employ data from Brazil, which like many developing countries displays greater variation in intra-household education attainment than most high-income countries. Unlike prior analyses, IV estimation is employed to control for endogeneity and other biases. Contrary to prior findings, we report a robust monotonically <b>declining</b> <b>relationship</b> between the intra-household dispersion of education attainment and instrumented income.

Data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) are used to simulate the effects of both programs. Increases in the EITC between 1989 and 1992 delivered a much larger proportion of a given dollar of benefits to the poor than did increases in the minimum wage from $ 3. 35 to $ 4. 25. Scheduled increases in the EITC through 1996 will also do far more for the working poor than raising the minimum wage. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on child labour {{has found that}} poverty increases the incidence of child labour. In this paper, I build a model of child labour which argues that a missing component in the previous findings is the existence of labour market imperfections. Its findings predict an ambiguous affect of land on child labour, which depends {{on the degree of}} substitutability between land and labour. Empirically, this paper tests the degree to which child labour then depends on the levels of land that these communities receive. Allowing the effect of land on child labour to be nonlinear, it was found that there is a risk on an increase in the incidence of child labour as the land reform progresses and more land is allocated to farm families.

The spectrum covering the whole optical range at day 6 shows the principal plus diffuse-enhanced spectrum. The presence of strong Fe II multiplets with P-Cyg profiles suggest that V 1494 Aql belongs to the "Fe II" class defined by Williams (1992). The medium-resolution profiles (lambda/Delta lambda ≈ 7000) of the Hgamma and Hdelta lines show well-defined sharp absorption features with the same radial velocities, while the Halpha split into two distinct emission peaks {{in the last two}} spectra (Delta t= 19 and 28 days).
