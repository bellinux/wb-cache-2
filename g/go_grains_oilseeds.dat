The somewhat successful Uruguay Round had budget and internal reform pressure to assist the process. The United States currently has large budget surpluses, and efficiency effects from policy reform following the Uruguay Round have reduced the possible gains from further domestic reform. Without these pressures, further negotiated reform in the <b>grain</b> and <b>oilseed</b> sectors is a remote possibility. On the other hand, there are good prospects for a multilateral environmental agreement on climate change.

40|$|For the {{new round}} of WTO {{multilateral}} trade liberalisation negotiations to be successful, the world {{will need to be}} more enthusiastic and flexible about opening markets. Partisans will need to submerge their self-interests, and the U. S. will need to take the initiative for more open markets. This paper makes the case that only modest changes in the U. S. domestic <b>grain,</b> <b>oilseed,</b> and cotton programmes are needed for compatibility with global free trade. The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 and related policy changes in the 1990 s brought fundamental reforms compatible with freer domestic and foreign markets. Chief among these were a shift from coupled deficiency payments to decoupled direct payments, an end to supply management, and less engagement of government in commodity stock accumulation and export subsidies. Converting commodity price support to recourse loans while ending all but administrative cost subsidies to crop insurance would go far to liberalise <b>grain,</b> <b>oilseed,</b> and cotton policies. Unilateral termination of commodity programmes including direct payments totalling 42 percent of net cash farm income in year 2000 would appear to be traumatic to producers. However, reduction of direct payments could be offset (for farm income) by rising farm commodity prices and receipts resulting from (1) less farm output attending lower loan rates and crop insurance subsidies, and (2) world farm commodity price-enhancement from freer global trade. ...|$|R
