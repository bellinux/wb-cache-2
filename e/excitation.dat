40|$|The role of {{collective}} phonon <b>excitations</b> on {{the properties of}} cold atoms in optical lattices is investigated. These phonon <b>excitations</b> are collective <b>excitations,</b> whose appearance is caused by intersite atomic interactions correlating the atoms, {{and they do not}} arise without such interactions.

At seasonal time scales, both model-estimated <b>excitations</b> from the geophysical fluids envelope (i. e., atmosphere, ocean, and hydrosphere) and GRACE-observed <b>excitations</b> agree remarkably well with polar motion observations in the chi(2) component, {{and in the}} chi(1) component, model estimates and observed geodetic <b>excitations</b> show significant discrepancies. However, mass <b>excitations</b> estimated from GRACE show significantly better agreement with observed <b>excitations</b> than those from models, especially in chi(1). due to better quantification of terrestrial water storage and oceanic mass changes using GRACE data. Furthermore. GRACE satellite gravity measurements offer a unique means for quantifying contributions from cryospheric angular momentum (CAM) change, a component mostly neglected in previous studies {{due to the lack}} of adequate observations or reliable ice sheets models. Based on GRACE estimates, CAM <b>excitations</b> appear a minor, but not negligible contributor to seasonal <b>excitations</b> of polar motion. The significantly better agreement in chi(2) (than that in chi(1)) between observations and model <b>excitations</b> is related to the higher sensitivity of chi(2) <b>excitations</b> to atmospheric pressure and terrestrial water changes over the Eurasia and North American continents, because of the special relationship between the Delta S- 21 spherical harmonic coefficient (proportional to chi(2)) mass model and the locations of the two continents.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of experimental data shows that, {{in addition to}} phonon [...] roton <b>excitations</b> in superfluid helium, there necessarily exist at least one branch of elementary <b>excitations</b> whose energy spectrum strongly depends on temperature. On this basis, the Landau superfluidity criterion is generalized for several branches of elementary <b>excitations,</b> {{taking into account that}} the critical velocity should vanish during the phase transition of liquid helium from the superfluid state to the normal state. We suppose that a new spectrum of <b>excitations</b> with a gap, depending on interparticle interaction, corresponds to the transition of helium to superfluid state. This gap exists only in superfluid state and disappears at the transition temperature to normal state. The phonon-roton branch of <b>excitations</b> has no crucial influence on superfluidity. Rotons, as well as phonons, are not the specific <b>excitations</b> for the superfluid helium, but exist as universal <b>excitations</b> in liquid state, and form the continuous branch of <b>excitations</b> in different liquids.
