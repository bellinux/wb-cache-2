5|$|However, Jones' {{figure of}} 600,000 {{is based on}} {{assumptions}} about limitanei unit strengths which may be too high. Jones calculated unit-strengths in Egypt under Diocletian using papyrus evidence of unit payrolls. But a rigorous reassessment of that evidence by R. Duncan-Jones concluded that Jones had overestimated unit sizes by 2–6 times. For example, Jones estimated legions on the frontiers at c. 3,000 men and other units at c. 500. But Duncan-Jones' revisions found frontier legions of around 500 men, an ala of just 160 and an equites unit of 80. Even allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> some of these units were detachments from larger units, {{it is likely that}} Diocletianic unit-strengths were far lower than earlier.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

Fourteen shelters were opened, and the deteriorating North Carolina Highway12 Bonner Bridge was closed as a precaution. Mandatory evacuations were declared for Hatteras Island and Richland Township in Beaufort County while voluntary evacuations were announced for Ocracoke Island, Aurora, Pamlico Beach, and Belhaven. Approximately 4,300individuals fled from Ocracoke Island via ferry despite only being under a voluntary evacuation, and while a mandatory evacuation had been encouraged by Hyde County's emergency management director, other officials turned down the request.

5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of the}} distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to a current and intense debate among economists on whether real exchange rate undervaluation can boost growth. It focuses on addressing econometric and empirical issues that cast doubt {{about the validity of}} such positive impact. It also allows <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effect of undervaluation on growth operates with delay or dependent on the persistence or the level of undervaluation. We did not find any convincing support to the claim that a depreciated real exchange rate promotes economic growth. We argue that the contrast between our results and the documented examples of a successful adoption of undervaluation strategy reported in the literature reveals that undervaluation alone is not enough to boost growth. The simultaneous adoption of companion policies may be behind the claimed success. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{military}} alliances to deter {{depends on their}} credibility: {{the degree to which}} others believe that allies will fulfill their commitments. One way to measure credibility is to compare nations' lists of allies. The more similar those lists are, the more similar are those nations' security interests. This increases the credibility and the deterrent capability of resulting alliances and, consequently, decreases the amount of militarized conflict. In order to measure the similarity of alliance lists, one needs to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> countries can have multiple allies, can be indirectly linked to one another by their allies, and can be part of mutually exclusive groups of directly and indirectly related allies. Using a new measure called relational similarity, this article finds support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> credibility argument and also finds that relational similarity better explains observed patterns of conflict than existing measures.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} systematic performance {{differences between}} {{younger and older}} democracies: younger democracies are more corrupt; exhibit less rule of law, lower levels of bureaucratic quality, and lower secondary school enrollments; and spend more on public investment and government workers.

This explanation, first advanced in Keefer and Vlaicu (2004), offers a concrete interpretation of what political institutionalization might mean, and why it is that young democracies frequently fail to become older and well-performing democracies. A variety of tests support this explanation against alternatives.
