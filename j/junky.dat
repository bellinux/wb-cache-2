500|$|On August 12, 2013, a {{music video}} {{for the song}} [...] "Motorcycle" [...] was released.

500|$|Conversely, Andy Webster of The New York Times said, [...] "Its bargain-basement {{production}} {{values and}} lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it [...] "so desperately wants to be cultishly admired...that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, The Warriors, Mad Max 2, and A Clockwork Orange, and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was [...] "a <b>junky,</b> disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning". Nick Schager of Slant Magazine gave it 1½ stars out of 4, and called it a [...] "humorless void" [...] and a [...] "wannabe cult hit". Eric Hynes of The Village Voice said, [...] "the film's charm fades fast" [...] and , [...] "he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth." [...] Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not [...] "obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is [...] "just plain badand boring, and repetitive" [...] and that [...] "as comedy, it just feels numbing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film [...] "is {{by no means the}} worst thing I've ever seen", but that it [...] "should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".|$|E

2500|$|Carl Solomon {{was arguably}} more {{eccentric}} than psychotic.

2500|$|Mr. Bungle’s {{style has}} {{influenced}} many acts from the alternative metal genre, most notably Korn, who have utilized {{what they have}} dubbed the [...] "Mr. Bungle chord" [...] (A flat fifth chord or [...] "Tritone").

2500|$|In 1974, {{concerned}} about his friend's well-being, Allen Ginsberg gained for Burroughs a contract to teach creative writing at the City College of New York. Burroughs successfully withdrew from heroin use and moved to New York. He eventually found an apartment, affectionately dubbed [...] "The Bunker", on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at 222 Bowery. The dwelling was a partially converted YMCA gym, complete with lockers and communal showers. The building fell within New York City rent control policies that made it extremely cheap; it was only about four hundred dollars a month until 1981 when the rent control rules changed, doubling the rent overnight. Burroughs added [...] "teacher" [...] {{to the list of}} jobs he did not like, as he lasted only a semester as a professor; he found the students uninteresting and without much creative talent. Although he needed income desperately, he turned down a teaching position at the University at Buffalo for $15,000 a semester. [...] "The teaching gig was a lesson in never again. You were giving out all this energy and nothing was coming back." [...] His savior was the newly arrived, twenty-one-year-old bookseller and Beat Generation devotee James Grauerholz, who worked for Burroughs part-time as a secretary as well as in a bookstore. Grauerholz suggested the idea of reading tours. Grauerholz had managed several rock bands in Kansas and took the lead in booking for Burroughs reading tours that would help support him throughout the next two decades. It raised his public profile, eventually aiding in his obtaining new publishing contracts. Through Grauerholz, Burroughs became a monthly columnist for the noted popular culture magazine Crawdaddy, for which he interviewed Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page in 1975. Burroughs decided to relocate back to the United States permanently in 1976. He then began to associate with New York cultural players such as Andy Warhol, John Giorno, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and Susan Sontag, frequently entertaining them at the Bunker; he also visited venues like CBGB to watch the likes of Patti Smith perform. Throughout early 1977, Burroughs collaborated with Southern and Dennis Hopper on a screen adaptation of <b>Junky.</b> Financed by a reclusive acquaintance of Burroughs, the project lost traction after financial problems and creative disagreements between Hopper and Burroughs.|$|E
