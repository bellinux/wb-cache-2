50|$|The <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), less {{commonly}} known as fire-winged parakeet, is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeet</b> is {{indigenous}} to northwestern Peru and western Ecuador, living in subtropical or tropical regions encompassing dry forests, moist lowland forests, shrubland, and arable land.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeets</b> do {{not build}} their nests in the {{canopies}} of trees. Rather, {{they prefer to}} build their nests in protected areas such as active termite mounds or tree hollows. It is unknown why termites tolerate their presence. Their eggs, which are about 2 cm. x 1.6 cm. are laid in clutches of four to six eggs in a nest padded with moss. The hen will incubate the eggs for about 25-26 days while the male stands guard outside the nest.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is mostly}} green in color with {{characteristic}} gray cheeks and a gray-blue crown. The {{underside of the}} wings bears a bright orange swath between the lesser coverts and the mantle earning them the name [...] "orange-flanked parakeet", and the primary flight feathers are normally blue or bluish green in color. Indeed, the species name pyrrhoptera, (lit. flame wing) gives light to these attributes. The average wingspan, length, and weight are 117 mm., 20 cm., and 54 grams, respectively. The average lifespan in captivity is approximately 23 years. <b>Grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeets</b> vocalize quite loudly despite their size. The sound {{could be described as}} a quick, sharp screech, and vocalizations may involve many monotone screeches in succession.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Mycobacterium spp. {{is still}} a problem, {{especially}} in ornamental fowl and pet birds and, for underlying the relevance of this infection in the latter, the authors report a retrospective study on mycobacteriosis in 123 psittacines. Materials and methods: These cases were analyzed by means of gross examination, histopathology (haematoxylin and eosin, Ziehl-Nielsen stain) and 23 / 123 cases through a Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Enzyme Digestion (PCR-RED) based upon Hsp 65 gene for the identification of Mycobacterium (M.) species. Results: The most commonly affected species were Amazon parrots and <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeets.</b> Lesions were observed in liver, spleen, intestine, lungs, air sacs, conjunctiva, eyelid, skin, infraorbital sinus, heart, pancreas, kidney, testes, ovary and, only histologically, in adrenal, bone, skeletal muscle, thymus, brain, pancreas, synovium, parathyroids, thyroid, perineurium. Most commonly, infiltration of numerous epithelioid cells or foamy macrophages, with or without multinucleated cells, containing acid-fast bacilli, occurred. An interesting lesion was the granulomatous aortitis in a cockatiel concurrent with atherosclerosis. 20 / 23 cases submitted for molecular diagnosis were positive for M. genavense, 2 / 23 for M. avium and 1 / 23 had mixed infection. Conclusions: Mycobacterium genavense represents the primary agent of mycobacteriosis in psittacines {{and the potential for}} zoonosis must be considered, especially in immunocompromised persons, children and pet birdsâ€™ breeders.

50|$|A {{total of}} 111 bird {{species have been}} {{registered}} in the park, some of them are: the grey-backed hawk, the <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the blackish-headed spinetail and the slaty becard.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{its native}} home, the <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeet</b> is widely kept as a pet. With patience, these birds may {{be taught to}} mimic human sounds, albeit without the clarity of larger parrots.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty three cases of mycobacteriosis were {{diagnosed}} in psittacine birds from a total of 9, 241 submissions for necropsy examination or histopathology made to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System between 1990 and 2007. The species affected most commonly were Amazon parrots (n = 32; 26 %) and <b>grey-cheeked</b> <b>parakeets</b> (n = 23; 18. 7 %). The main gross findings on necropsy examination were enlarged and mottled pale livers and spleens and thickening of the small intestinal wall with numerous pale miliary nodules on the mucosa. Microscopical examination revealed infiltration of foamy macrophages and giant cells containing acid-fast bacteria in various organs. The gene encoding mycobacterial 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp 65) was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from DNA extracted from 22 cases. The species of Mycobacterium involved was determined by analysis of restriction endonuclease patterns of the PCR products. M. genavense was detected in 19 cases and M. avium in two cases. One parrotlet (Touit spp.) had a mixed infection of both species of mycobacteria. It is concluded that M. genavense is {{the primary cause of}} mycobacteriosis in psittacine birds and the potential for zoonotic disease should be considered, especially for immunocompromised owners.
