It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface.

Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post spinning operation and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand).

Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study is to evaluate the impact of laser treatment on the physical and mechanical properties of 100 % cotton single jersey knitted fabrics with different <b>yarn</b> <b>counts.</b> The fabrics had been treated using a carbon dioxide laser (CO 2) with different levels of intensity in terms of the resolution and treatment time, i. e., the resolution (28, 32, 36, 40 dpi) and pixel time (100, 110, 120, 130 mu s). The laser power density resulting from the different combinations of laser variables was measured. Various evaluation tests including scanning electron microscopy, fabric weight, fabric thickness and fabric bursting strength were used to study the effect of laser treatment on the knitted fabrics.

The in-plane yarn pull-out force has good correlation to the impact performance: fabrics with higher pull-out force performed better in impact tests.
