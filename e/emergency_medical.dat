5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> specialists.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} is a specialty that was first {{developed in the}} United States in the 1960s. For the United States, {{the high number of}} traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> system and led to the establishment of modern <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> services. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In more {{advanced}} developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning.

In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E

For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the risk {{perceptions}} and attitudes of healthcare personnel, especially of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care personnel, regarding the possibility of an outbreak or epidemic event. This study was designed to investigate pre-event knowledge and attitudes of a national sample of the <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care providers in relation to a potential human influenza pandemic, and to determine predictors of these attitudes. Surveys were distributed to a random, cross-sectional sample of 20 % of the Australian <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care workforce (n = 2, 929), stratified by the nine services operating in Australia, as well as by gender and location. The surveys included: (1) demographic information; (2) knowledge of influenza; and (3) attitudes and perceptions related to working during influenza pandemic conditions. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of pandemic-related risk perceptions. Among the 725 Australian <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care personnel who responded, 89 % were very anxious about working during pandemic conditions, and 85 % perceived a high personal risk associated with working in such conditions. In general, respondents demonstrated poor knowledge in relation to avian influenza, influenza generally, and infection transmission methods. Less than 5 % of respondents perceived that they had adequate education/training about avian influenza. Logistic regression analyses indicate that, in managing the attitudes and risk perceptions of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care staff, particular attention should be directed toward the paid, male workforce (as opposed to volunteers), and on personnel whose relationship partners do not work in the health industry. These results highlight the potentially crucial role of education and training in pandemic preparedness. Organizations that provide <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care must address this apparent lack of knowledge regarding infection transmission, and procedures for protection and decontamination. Careful management of the perceptions of <b>emergency</b> prehospital <b>medical</b> care personnel during a pandemic is likely to be critical in achieving an effective response to a widespread outbreak of infectious disease...|$|R
