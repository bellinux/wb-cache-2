5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{population}} had been reduced to about 50. In 1909 the Chief Protector of Aborigines visited the Island, apparently to check on the activities of Japanese pearling crews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> reported the existence of a small camp of Aborigines.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.|$|E
5|$|Flint {{fragments}} show Blaise Castle Estate {{was probably}} first inhabited by Neolithic farmers. There is more definitive evidence for Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman activity through the distinctive hill-forts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> other archaeological finds. The {{value of this}} historic landscape was recognised when it became a scheduled monument in 1982.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony, the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River was known as the Kangaroo Ground. This {{suggests}} that the land was open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> may have formed a significant part of the Aboriginal diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the arch {{remained}} rural until the early 20th century. A tram used to pass near the arch between 1905 and 1929. After World War II, the suburb of Fleur-de-Lys developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> it got {{its name from the}} heraldic symbols on the arch.|$|E
50|$|Native {{evergreen}} {{oak trees}} are common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fallbrook <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> places form continuous woods (e.g. Live Oak Park area).

5|$|The station {{took its}} name from the King's Cross building, a {{monument}} to King George IV that stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> was demolished in 1845. Construction was on the site of a smallpox hospital and it replaced a temporary terminus at Maiden Lane that had opened on 7 August 1850.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} the bridge's opening the Second World War broke out. Because of their close {{proximity}} to Chelsea Barracks {{it was expected that}} enemy bombers would target the three road bridges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> a temporary bridge was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945.|$|E

40|$|The new 2010 {{assessment}} {{has updated}} the {{biological reference points}} based on an updated yield-per-recruit analysis {{and the results of}} the SCALE length-tuned population model that incorporates multiple survey indices and catch data. Based on accepted reference points from these updated analyses, monkfish <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> northern <b>and</b> southern management <b>areas</b> are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (Figures A 1 and A 2). The existing overfishing threshold is based on Fmax, and this was retained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2010 assessment. The updated estimates of Fmax are 0. 43 per year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 0. 46 per year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>area.</b> Estimates of current F (2009) are 0. 10 per year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 0. 07 per year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>area,</b> both less than the respective overfishing thresholds. The new recommended estimates of Btarget are 52, 930 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 74, 490 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> estimates of Bthreshold are 26, 465 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 37, 245 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> current (2009) estimates of total biomass are 66, 062 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 131, 218 mt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> total catch produced from the longterm Btarget at the respective values of Fmax (i. e., proxy for Fmsy), is 10, 745 mt for <b>the</b> northern <b>area</b> <b>and</b> 15, 279 mt for <b>the</b> southern <b>area.</b> These updated biomass reference points ar...|$|R

5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E

5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000â€“80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties {{are more difficult to}} come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E
