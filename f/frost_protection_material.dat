40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the characterization of the mechanical behavior of unbound granular road base materials (UGMs). An extensive laboratory investigation is described, in which various methods for determination of the mechanical properties of granular materials are examined for their applicability, particularly in developing countries. Further, the mechanical behavior of unbound granular materials {{as a function of the}} moisture content and the degree of compaction is investigated. A study into the modeling of the stress dependent mechanical behavior of granular materials is presented. Finally, verification and validation of a relatively simple characterization technique, the repeated load CBR test (RL-CBR), by the results of cyclic load triaxial testing are provided and overall practical implications of the research are presented. The laboratory investigation involves a large range of granular materials, mainly (sub-) tropical road base and subbase materials. The performed tests yield fundamental parameters that describe the strength, stiffness and resistance to permanent deformation of the materials tested. In addition to the (sub-) tropical road base and subbase materials, a recycled mix-granulate widely used in pavement construction in the Netherlands and a base course and <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> <b>material</b> from Austria are incorporated to a limited extent in the laboratory testing program. Most roads in developing countries are either unpaved or have a thin asphalt surfacing, and as a consequence the granular base and subbase layers provide the bulk of the bearing capacity. Although the important structural contribution of these unbound granular layers is understood, engineering practice still greatly relies on tests which mainly give index properties of these materials. Pavement structures are designed based on empirical design methods related to a single design chart, restricting the incorporation of marginal materials or new materials for which the empirical data sets are not available. The reasons that pavement design and construction in developing countries rely on empirical design procedures that are basically developed for completely different conditions are: - the affordability and complexity of the cyclic triaxial tests required to determine the stress dependent mechanical behavior of granular materials; - the perceived complexity and unfamiliarity with the computational tools (non-linear multilayer or finite element analysis) required to model the performance of pavements using this mechanical behavior despite the availability of powerful digital computers and their penetration even to remote places. In order to promote the introduction of Mechanistic-Empirical design methods in developing countries, this research was set up with two goals: i. to make the characterization technique for the mechanical behavior of granular road base materials more accessible to practice through the development of a simple and effective characterization technique; ii. to further develop the understanding of the stress dependent mechanical behavior of unbound (sub-) tropical base and subbase materials. To achieve the first aim an innovative and relatively simple testing procedure, the RL-CBR test, is developed to characterize the mechanical behavior of the UGMs. RL-CBR testing is performed on the various granular materials in steel moulds without and with strain gauges. With the strain gauges the confining condition and hence the stress state of the specimen is estimated through mould deformation measurements. The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the RL-CBR testing and interpret the test results into mechanical behavior. Due to the non-uniform complex stress distribution in the RL-CBR compared to the triaxial test, fundamental material properties such as the stiffness modulus are less easy to determine. Extensive triaxial testing on the various granular materials is performed to realize the second goal. The result of this investigation is also used to validate and verify the results of the RL-CBR tests. Moreover, the effect of influence factors such as moisture content, degree of compaction, material type etc. on the mechanical behavior is investigated. For the unbound granular road base materials, particularly the natural gravels, the effect of the moisture content on the mechanical behavior was found to be more significant than the effect of the degree of compaction. Relative to the failure and permanent deformation behavior the resilient deformation behavior is less affected by the moisture content and the degree of compaction. The RL-CBR testing serves well its purpose to get a good estimate of the fundamental mechanical properties of granular road base materials from a rather simple characterization technique. The practical accessibility of characterizing the mechanical behavior of UGMs can therefore be enhanced through RL-CBR testing. This is proven by the fact that good correlations have been found between the stiffness results of the two characterization techniques, i. e. the complex triaxial test and the newly developed repeated load CBR test.

40|$|The Russian River <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation (“Frost Protection Rule”) {{states that}} “any {{diversion}} {{of water from}} the Russian River stream system, including the pumping of hydraulically connected groundwater, for purposes of frost protection” must be diverted in accordance with an approved “water demand management program” (WDMP), or the diversion “is an unreasonable method of diversion and use and a violation of Water Code section 100. ” The California State Water Resources Control Board (“State Water Board”) adopted the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule on September 20, 2011. Litigation over the rule culminated in the decision in Light et al. v. State Water Res. Control Bd., 226 Cal. App. 4 th 1463 (2014), which confirmed that the State Water Board has authority to adopt quasi-legislative rules for the reasonable use and reasonable manner of water diversion. The court also reiterated that the reasonable use doctrine applies to all water rights—including riparian and pre- 1914 appropriators. Finally, the court approved the State Water Board’s reliance on industry-led consortiums of water right holders to assist in the management of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> program through the adoption of the WDMPs. Readers of the Light decision could be forgiven for assuming that the case presented a classic conflict between heavy-handed regulators, environmental interests, and farmers. As the rule-making proceeded, there were moments of conflict and some grape growers eventually filed a lawsuit. However, there was also a great deal of common ground between others in the winegrape industry, State Water Board members, and the conservation community. One of the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule’s untold stories is the tremendous amount of progress that was made “on the ground” while the rule was in development and delayed by litigation.

40|$|In {{areas of}} {{seasonal}} frost, frost susceptibility composed by frost heaving {{during the winter}} and thaw softening during the spring {{is one of the}} most dangerous phenomenon for transportation, road and railway infrastructure. Therefore, the need for <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer becomes imperative. The purpose of <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer is to prevent frost from penetrating down through the pavement and into the sub-soils. Frost susceptible soils under the road can be cause damages on the roads or other structures due to frost heave or reduced capacity characteristics thaw period. "Frost heave" is the term given to the upwards displacement of the ground surface caused by the formation of ice within soils or aggregates (Rempel et al., 2004). Nowadays in Scandinavia the most common <b>material</b> used in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer in the pavement structure of roads and in the ballast of the railway tracks are coarse-grain crushed rocks aggregates. Based on the capillary rise, the mechanics of frost heave phenomenon is based on the interaction between aggregates and water, as suggested by Konrad and Lemieux in 2005 that said that the fraction of material below the 0. 063 mm sieve for coarse-grained soils must be controlled so as to reduce the sensitivity to frost heave. The study conducted in this thesis project is divided in two parts: - the analysis of the coarse grained aggregates used in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer in Norway; - the analysis of the frost heave phenomenon in the laboratory under known boundary conditions, through the use of the most widely used method, the frost heave test, in” closed system” (without access of water). ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{will discuss}} the Light case from the {{perspective}} of my firm’s vineyardist clients—including our understanding of the Reasonable Use Doctrine and its application to the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation. The underlying premise of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation is the theory that reductions in streamflow caused by <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> diversions cause or contribute to stranding of juvenile salmonids in the exposed gravel banks of the rivers and streams in the Russian River watershed. One of the key issues in Light was whether good science supports this theory. From the perspective of my vineyardist clients, the State Board relied on very weak science in support of this theory. As always, perspective is crucial in determining what level of science is necessary to support a regulation that will impose major costs on vineyardists in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. From the perspective of my clients, there ought to be sound science underlying the relationship between frost diversions and salmonid strandings before imposing any water use regulation. In contrast, members of the environmental and academic community seem less interested in examining the science and more inclined to accept the State Board’s conclusion tying frost diversions to salmonid strandings—at least in my conversations with these folks.

40|$|Abstract – Vineyards are a {{dominant}} feature of many landscapes in Mediterranean-climate regions. We {{examined the effects}} of streamflow declines, associated with vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> on benthic-macroinvertebrate communities at three sites along three small streams in the Mediterranean-climate region of Northern California. One site was heavily affected by water withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> the other two were not. In addition, we examined relationships between vineyard coverage and benthic-macroinvertebrate community response using data from 59 sampling events at 39 sites along 35 small streams in Napa County, California. We tested three a priori hypotheses in terms of the response of biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates to high vineyard coverage: (1) proportion of individuals with semi-voltine (i. e., one generation every 2 years) life cycles would be lower compared to those with uni- and multi-voltine cycles, (2) proportion of individuals able to undergo diapause would be higher, and (3) proportion of individuals with the ability to burrow into the substrate would be higher. In the three-site study, we found that vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> coincided with consistently lower values in both the benthic-macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for Northern California streams and the ratio of Ephemeroptera–Plecoptera–Trichoptera to Odonata–Coleoptera–Hemiptera individuals (EPT/OCH), a metric developed for European Mediterranean streams. In the broader-scale study, we observed that vineyard-coverage levels above about 20 % coincided with lower values of the B-IBI. The semi-voltine life-cycle trait was lower above this level, whereas the diapause and burrowing traits were not affected...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of plant disease depends on {{interactions between the}} host plant, a pathogen, and the environment in a dynamic called &#x 22;the disease triangle&#x 22;. Bacterial shoot blight (BSB) disease, caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _theae_ (_Pst_), is a major bacterial disease of tea plants in Japan and substantially reduces tea productivity. BSB mainly occurs in the low-temperature season, and lesion formation by _Pst_ is enhanced by both low temperature {{and the presence of}} ice nucleation-active _Xanthomonas campestris_ (INAX), which catalyses ice formation at - 2 to - 4 ^o^C and is frequently co-isolated with _Pst_ from tea plants^ 5 ^.

40|$|The American {{cranberry}} (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is {{an important}} temperate woody shrub crop whose fruit has human health benefits. Cranberry acquires cold hardiness in the autumn and loses it in spring, following deacclimation. <b>Frost</b> <b>protection</b> is necessary in cranberry production {{as a means to}} reduce bud damage due to low spring temperatures. The objectives of the field studies were to evaluate two methods of sprinkler irrigation for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> the conventional approach consisting of continuous irrigation throughout the night (CON) and intermittent cycling of sprinklers (INT) incorporating cycling on and off throughout the night, by (i) assessing bud damage and yield for cranberry cultivars 2 ̆ 7 Early Black 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Howes 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 Stevens 2 ̆ 7 managed under both methods and (ii) to determine the volume of water used in each method. The objectives of the laboratory studies were to (i) evaluate and quantify carbohydrates and lipids synthesized by cranberry during the cold acclimation period under a controlled environment and to (ii) determine the cold hardiness (LT 50) and lowest survival temperature (LST) of buds of economically important cranberry cultivars during acclimation. For INT to be an effective frost control method, temperature set points should be cultivar specific. Despite differences in bud damage, cranberry yield data did not show any {{significant differences between the two}} frost management methods. Since cranberry plants produce more flowers than the number of set fruit that can be supported, the remaining flowers in damaged buds may have been sufficient to produce similar yields in both methods. Substantial water savings were obtained under INT, especially on mild frost nights. Greater concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNSC) and membrane stabilizing lipids and a higher fatty acid unsaturation index were associated with low acclimation temperatures. This result suggests the importance of these compounds in increasing cold hardiness in cranberry during acclimation. In addition, a progression of freezing tolerance, determined as the LT 50 and LST, was noted in the fall for all the cranberry cultivars. Knowledge of bud hardiness in the fall is important in considering the need to protect buds.
