25|$|In 1991, Broad was {{promoted}} to Head of the Premier's Office under Joan Kirner. This tenure was to be short-lived, as the Kirner government was defeated the following year, but she re-emerged as the party's Assistant National Secretary in 1993. While in this position, she had considerable influence over the creation of federal ALP policy, and campaigned {{for the rights of}} women in the party. To this end, Broad {{played a significant role in}} the 1994 introduction of the ALP's affirmative action scheme, aiming to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> pre-selected in 35 percent of winnable seats. She was also heavily involved in the creation in 1996 of Emily's List Australia, the support network for ALP women.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Yale began {{discussions with}} its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster {{coeducation}} at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female {{and part of}} the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when the Ivy League still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969. Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate; she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> starting from freshman year; at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall {{at the south end of}} Old Campus.|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of being}} hidden [...] "unmentionables", Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a luxury product {{with the highest}} price of any mass-merchandised brand. This {{strategy}} also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal was to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> see their Wonderbras as a cosmetic—a beauty enhancer—rather than a functional garment.

The ship is thoroughly equipped and everyone on her will be saved." [...] Charlotte Colyer's husband Harvey called to his wife as she was put in a lifeboat, [...] "Go, Lottie!

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should <b>have</b> <b>women</b> compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Partly in {{response}} to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce [...] "total war", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> with children exempted from conscription, {{even if they had}} child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the [...] "extermination" [...] of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.|$|E
500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I was stupid enough to think I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E

He writes {{it is possible that}} not all churches <b>had</b> <b>women</b> diakonos, but some churches like Cenchrea did.

2500|$|An {{underlying}} {{theme is}} the brief undertone of feminism, most notably represented in Amy's 'Cool Girl' speech.

Flynn is a self-identified feminist and has stated that Amy's [...] "just pragmatically evil" [...] character and non-conformity to the traditional perception of women as innately good characters are the embodiment of feminism, which she defined as [...] "the ability to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> who are bad characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following upon {{years of}} {{discussion}} in the Episcopal Church and elsewhere, in 1976, the General Convention amended canon law to permit {{the ordination of women}} to the priesthood.

Another four [...] "irregular" [...] ordinations (the [...] "Washington Four") also occurred in 1975 in Washington, D.C.

She refused to <b>have</b> <b>women</b> of questionable virtue attend her Court.
