500|$|Many {{species of}} {{butterfly}} maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may stray into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their temperature is above {{when it is}} cool, they can position themselves to expose {{the underside of the}} wings to the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches , they can orientate themselves with the folded wings <b>edgewise</b> to the sun. Basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine forms.|$|E
500|$|Clare Heal of the Daily Express, in her {{review of}} the third series, praised the show's [...] "spot-on spoofs of modern telly" [...] and agreed that [...] "There's no {{particular}} target audience but pretty much anyone of any age will find something in there for them". Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show [...] "does also provide evidence, <b>edgewise</b> between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence... in fact, it might just {{be one of the}} most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." [...] Stephen Kelly of The Guardian argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just [...] "the best show on children's television—it's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an [...] "astonishing cast... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." [...] In an article discussing the League of Gentlemen troupe's appearance in the same series, the Radio Times Gareth McLean agreed that [...] "despite nominally being a children's programme, Horrible Histories is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that [...] "ultimately, comedy performers relish [...] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." [...] Graeme Virtue of The Scotsman called the League's reunion a [...] "coup" [...] for the series: [...] "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} tree is the peculiar appearance of its small branches and twigs. [...] The bark attaches itself to these in plates <b>edgewise</b> instead of laterally, {{and a piece of}} the leafless branch {{with the aid of a}} little imagination readily takes on a reptilian form; indeed, the tree is sometimes called [...] "alligatorwood".|$|E
2500|$|... {{including}} the famous 160 meter radio tower in Moscow (1922). Since Melnikov and Shukhov were {{well acquainted with}} each other and made joint projects (Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Garage), {{it is not surprising that}} the Melnikov’s house in Krivoarbatsky pereulok was built in the form of an original lattice shell. The overhead covers of the own Мelnikov’s house are the honeycomb lattice shells made of wooden boards placed <b>edgewise.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Bankemper {{wrote her}} {{accounts}} of those racing years in A Good Run: 1983-1990, {{the book was}} published by <b>Edgewise</b> Press along with a limited edition portfolio: Scarpitta/Bankemper: 5 + 10. This contains a collection of five videos by Scarpitta and Bankemper, Bankemper's book: A Good Run: 1983-1990 and ten [...] "videograms" [...] derived from the video Sal is Racer. Previews of the videos are posted on Vimeo: Sal is Racer, Racer's Tattoo, Potato Masher, Message to Leo, Crash.|$|E
2500|$|LaMarr {{auditioned for}} Tarantino because both {{had done a}} show for the Groundlings, an improv group, {{a few months before}} casting of the film began. In the audition, he read for Jules Winnfield and Brett. He {{described}} the filming experience of Pulp Fiction as [...] "the coolest, most easygoing, fun set I've ever been on ... Tarantino was fantastic. I mean, he can be almost unbearable as a person. At a party, you can't get a word in <b>edgewise</b> for, like, an hour. But as a director, he is so completely open and just... present. And he treated everybody on set well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take {{a message}} to the poor thing, with the {{greatest}} pleasure," [...] answered Sergeant Cuff, before I could put in a word <b>edgewise.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Morton doesn't flatter," [...] said Mrs. Bowen thoughtfully, {{turning the}} feather screen she held at her face, now <b>edgewise,</b> now flatwise, toward Colville.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what I {{want to tell}} you, Anne, if you'll {{ever give}} me a chance to get a word in <b>edgewise.</b> She was talking about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We orter put {{a couple}} of stones on the chimney-top, <b>edgewise,</b> like Jack Curtis does. It keeps out the rain without interferin' with the draft," [...] said Uncle Billy musingly.|$|E
6000|$|The baggage-camel {{had been}} bobbing {{his head to}} and fro for some time past, anxious to {{get a word in}} <b>edgewise.</b> Then I heard him say, as he cleared his throat, nervously: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{flight of}} stairs where Mr. George and Rollo were {{ascending}} was very broad; and it was formed of the long, flat bricks, such as Rollo had observed below. The bricks were placed <b>edgewise.</b>|$|E
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. Nay, I allow even that's {{better than}} the Pains Mrs. Prim takes to conceal her losses in Front--she draws her mouth till it resembles the {{aperture}} of a Poor's-Box, and all her words appear to slide out <b>edgewise.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{held the}} parcel, {{which was a}} flat one, towards the firelight, to learn if the rain had {{penetrated}} it. Resting it <b>edgewise</b> on the forge, he supported it perpendicularly with one hand, wiping his face with the handkerchief he held in the other.|$|E
60|$|So {{the giant}} stood him up, {{and he tried}} to walk <b>edgewise.</b> But {{whenever}} a breath of wind struck him he fell over at once, and several times he got badly crumpled up, so that the giant had to smooth him out again with his hands.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} his {{monoplane}} fell nearly <b>edgewise</b> with her nose down, {{and seemed to}} hesitate whether to overset altogether. He stood on his wind-shield, wrenching the wheel that swayed up over his head. And then {{the shock of the}} second explosion took his machine sideways.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked upward}} and saw two {{aeroplanes}} glide shouting far overhead, looked back, {{and saw the}} main body of the fleet opening out and rushing upward and outward; saw the one he had struck fall <b>edgewise</b> on and strike like a gigantic knife-blade along the wind-wheels below it.|$|E
6000|$|This was all we {{saw that}} day, for it was two o'clock, now, and {{according}} to custom the daily [...] "Washoe Zephyr" [...] set in; a soaring dust-drift {{about the size of}} the United States set up <b>edgewise</b> came with it, and the capital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace, idiot!" [...] said Bridgenorth; but {{so intent}} was Deborah on her vindication, {{that he could}} but thrust the interjection, as it were <b>edgewise,</b> between her exclamations, which {{followed}} as thick as is usual in cases, where folks endeavour to avert deserved censure by a clamorous justification ere the charge be brought.|$|E
6000|$|Rollo {{determined}} to do it. [...] "Then," [...] said he, [...] "I shall never be out of money, {{and that will be}} excellent." [...] His father told him that he must make a small cleft in the bark and wood, with a chisel and mallet, and then drive the cent in, <b>edgewise,</b> a little way.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{better get}} dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings," [...] said Marilla {{as soon as she}} could get a word in <b>edgewise.</b> [...] "Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as smart as you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Edgewise</b> or flat, in Druid-like device, [...] 190 [...] With leaden pools between or gullies bare, [...] The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice; [...] No life, no sound, {{to break}} the grim despair, [...] Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff [...] Down {{crackles}} riverward some thaw-sapped cliff, Or when the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} the old house {{from the corner of}} the street, but did not go nearer to it, lest, being observed, I might unwittingly do any harm to the design I had come to aid. The early sun was {{striking}} <b>edgewise</b> on its gables and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "No indeed," [...] {{answered}} the Captain, who was walking better since {{he began to}} move <b>edgewise.</b> [...] "There is but one Miss Cuttenclip, who is our Queen, because she made us all. These girls are Cuttenclips, to be sure, but their names are Emily and Polly and Sue and Betty and such things. Only the Queen is called Miss Cuttenclip." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertha smiled. [...] "He {{wants to}} paint me now. 'Not on your life' says I. 'You'd be doing double stunts with my {{freckles}}, and I won't stand for it.'" [...] She laughed. [...] "No sir-ree, I don't let any artist tip my freckles <b>edgewise</b> {{just to see}} how flip he is at it. I like Mr. Congdon, but I don't trust him--he's too much of a joker." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Edgewise</b> or flat, in Druid-like device, [...] 190 [...] With leaden pools between or gullies bare, [...] The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice; [...] No life, no sound, {{to break}} the grim despair, [...] Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff [...] Down {{crackles}} riverward some thaw-sapped cliff, [...] 195 [...] Or when the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there.|$|E
60|$|Lomaque stopped, {{and holding}} his hand <b>edgewise,</b> let it drop {{significantly}} over the hunchback's head. That action and the hints which preceded it seemed to bewilder the little man more than ever. He stared perplexedly at Lomaque; uttered {{a word or two}} of rough apology to his subordinate, and rolling his misshapen head portentously, walked away with the death-list crumpled up nervously in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never a word did Mr. Crow {{say about}} what I'd done toward fixing Foxy so he couldn't do any more mischief, and try as I might, I couldn't get in a word <b>edgewise</b> {{in the way of}} {{explaining}} that if it hadn't been for me Mr. Man's boy Tommy's dog Towser wouldn't {{have had a chance to}} get the best of Mr. Foxy Fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay there's {{been many}} a romance in Avonlea--and many a tragedy, too," [...] said Mr. Harrison drily. [...] "But your folks ain't like real folks anywhere. They {{talk too much}} and use too high-flown language. There's one place where that DALRYMPLE chap talks even on for two pages, and never lets the girl {{get a word in}} <b>edgewise.</b> If he'd done that in real life she'd have pitched him." ...|$|E
60|$|She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently {{until they}} reached the Green Gables lane. Poor Gilbert hardly {{had a chance to get}} a word in <b>edgewise.</b> Anne felt rather {{relieved}} when they parted. There had been a new, secret self-consciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert, ever since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo Lodge. Something alien had intruded into the old, perfect, school-day comradeship--something that threatened to mar it.|$|E
60|$|The {{brother and}} sister, being young and active, were pretty smart in making their exit, and David Butts, {{being used to}} doors, was not slow to shut his own, {{but they could not}} {{altogether}} baffle the colonel, for he was waiting outside. Indeed, he had been whistling with furious insolence through the keyhole all the time of the visit. Sliding in <b>edgewise,</b> at the moment of opening, he managed to scatter the ashes again, and whirl about some of the light articles before he was fairly expelled.|$|E
60|$|Nippers. Strictly {{this word}} is not {{indigenous}} to the whale's vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman's nipper {{is a short}} firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, {{is about the size}} of the iron part of a hoe. <b>Edgewise</b> moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.|$|E
6000|$|... 'An indescribable {{exasperation}} {{had sprung}} up in me as she talked--rage and regret were all in all. Scarcely knowing what I did, I furiously raised my hand and swung it round with my whole force to strike her. She turned quickly--and it was the poor creature's end. By her movement my hand came <b>edgewise</b> exactly in the nape of the neck--as men strike a hare to kill it. The effect staggered me with amazement. The blow must have disturbed the vertebrae; she fell at my feet, made a few movements, and uttered one low sound.|$|E
60|$|I alighted {{outside of}} the village, for no horse nor vehicle is {{permitted}} to enter its precincts, lest it should cause defilement of the well-scoured pavements. Shaking the dust off my feet, therefore, I prepared to enter, with due reverence and circumspection, this sanctum sanctorum of Dutch cleanliness. I entered by a narrow street, paved with yellow bricks, laid <b>edgewise,</b> and so clean that one might eat from them. Indeed, they were actually worn deep, not by the tread of feet, but by the friction of the scrubbing-brush.|$|E
60|$|The bridge led over {{a branch}} canal, which here {{comes into the}} main canal. The road to it lay along the dike, and formed the street of a little village. It was paved with bricks placed <b>edgewise,</b> and was as neat as a parlor floor. The houses were all on one side. They were very small; but they were so neat and pretty, and the forms of them were so strange and queer, that they looked like play houses, or like a scene in fairy land, rather than like the real habitations of men.|$|E
60|$|Fancy was now {{kneeling}} {{beside the}} two inverted hives, {{one of which}} rested against her lap, for convenience in operating upon the contents. She thrust her sleeves above her elbows, and inserted her small pink hand <b>edgewise</b> between each white lobe of honeycomb, performing the act so adroitly and gently as not to unseal a single cell. Then cracking the piece off at the crown of the hive by a slight backward and forward movement, she lifted each portion as it was loosened into a large blue platter, placed on a bench at her side.|$|E
