50|$|The {{results of}} the model showed that as {{inspection}} efforts increase, importers increase due care, or the pretreatment of shipments, and the total monetary loss of California crops decreases. The model showed that importers respond {{to an increase in}} <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> in different ways. Some importers responded to increased inspection rate by increasing pretreatment effort, while others chose to avoid shipping to a specific port, or shopped for another port. An important result of the model results is that it can show or provide recommendations to policy makers about the point at which importers may start to shop for ports, such as the inspection rate at which port shopping is introduced and the importers associated with a certain level of pest risk or transportation cost are likely to make these changes. Another interesting outcome of the model is that when inspectors were not able to learn to respond to an importer with previously infested shipments, damage to California broccoli crops was estimated to be $150 million. However, when inspectors were able to increase inspection rates of importers with previous violations, damage to the California broccoli crops was reduced by approximately 12%. The model provides a mechanism to predict the introduction of invasive species from agricultural imports and their likely damage. Equally as important, the model provides policy makers and border control agencies with a tool {{that can be used to}} determine the best allocation of inspectional resources.|$|E

40|$|Growth and {{liberalization}} {{of world trade}} have increased the risks of introduction of quarantine plant pests into importing countries. Import inspection of incoming commodities is a major tool for prevention of pest introductions related to world trade, but inspection capacities are limited. This article develops a theoretical and an empirical model for the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> for phytosanitary inspection of imported commodities when the inspecting agency has a limited capacity. It is shown that the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> equalizes marginal costs of pest introduction across risky commodity pathways. The numerical illustration finds the optimal allocation of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> of chrysanthemum cuttings imported in the Netherlands. The numerical results suggest that "ceteris paribus", greater <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> should be allocated to pathways whose inspection yields a greater reduction in the expected costs of pest introduction. The numerical results also suggest that import inspection has a high marginal benefit. In particular, we found that each additional euro of the inspection capacity decreases the expected costs of pest introduction from 18 to 49 euros, depending on the initial inspection capacity.

40|$|Preliminary {{estimates}} of the <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> to verify a Nuclear Material Cutoff Convention are presented. The estimates are based on (1) a database of about 650 facilities a total of eight states, i. e., the five nuclear-weapons states and three ``threshold`` states; (2) typical figures for inspection requirements for specific facility types derived from IAEA experience, where applicable; and (3) alternative {{estimates of}} <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> in cutoff options where full IAEA safeguards are not stipulated. Considerable uncertainty must {{be attached to the}} effort estimates. About 50 [...] 60 % of the effort for each option is attributable to 16 large-scale reprocessing plants assumed to be in operation in the eight states; it is likely that some of these will be shut down by the time the convention enters into force. Another important question involving about one third of the overall effort is whether Euratom inspections in France and the U. K. could obviate the need for full-scale IAEA inspections at these facilities. Finally, the database does not yet contain many small-scale and military-related facilities. The results are therefore not presented as predictions but as the consequences of alternative assumptions. Despite the preliminary nature of the estimates, it is clear that a broad application of NPT-like safeguards to the eight states would require dramatic increases in the IAEA`s safeguards budget. It is also clear that the major component of the increased <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> would occur at large reprocessing plants (and associated plutonium facilities). Therefore, significantly bounding the increased effort requires a limitation on the <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> in these facility types...|$|E

40|$|A {{rule that}} {{constrains}} decision-makers is enforced by an inspector who is supplied with a fixed level of inspection resources - inspection personnel, equipment, or time. How should the inspector distribute its inspection resources over several independent inspectees? What minimum level of resources {{is required to}} deter all violations? Optimal enforcement problems occur in many contexts; the motivating application for {{this study is the}} role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in support of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Using game-theoretic models, the resource level adequate for deterrence is characterized in a two-inspectee problem with inspections that are imperfect in the sense that violations can be missed. Detection functions, or probabilities of detecting a violation, are assumed to be increasing in inspection resources, permitting optimal allocations over inspectees to be described both in general and in special cases. When detection functions are convex, <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> should be concentrated on one inspectee chosen at random, but when they are concave it should be spread deterministicly over the inspectees.

40|$|Two {{shortest}} route models for determining where to allocate <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> on a production line are {{developed for the}} cases where this effort is unlimited or limited in its availability. A production line is defined as an ordered sequence of production stages, each stage consisting of a manufacturing operation followed by a potential inspection station. Items flow through the line in batches and may incur defects at any stage. Defects {{are assumed to be}} repairable or non-repairable. The defect generating process at any stage is taken to be an independent Bernoulli process with a known parameter. Two levels of <b>inspection</b> <b>effort</b> may be applied at any stage: no inspection or 100 % inspection. Thus, both models are used to determine the stages at which batches are to be 100 % inspected. A general cost structure is postulated first for the case where items with repairable defects are immediately repaired and items with non-repairable defects are discarded, and then for the case where all items found to be defective are replaced immediately with non-defectives. An expected cost per batch criterion is used to determine an optimal inspection plan in all cases. Examples are included. ...|$|E
