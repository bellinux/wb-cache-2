5|$|As {{a result}} of long delays, many {{environmental}} groups from France, Italy and Switzerland have worked together under the umbrella organisation, proMONT BLANC, to jointly raise concerns and {{to put pressure on}} national governments and the European Union to support and make quicker progress with World Heritage classification. In 2012 the organisation published a <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> and supportive rationale into the state of the Mont Blanc application to be a World Heritage Site. ProMont Blanc also undertakes reviews of a suite of 24 environmental, 24 economic and 10 social indicators across 15 towns around the massif (seven French, five Italian and three Swiss), and monitors and reports on the effectiveness of measures intended to deliver sustainable development across the region.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies suggest}} an {{association}} between ocular cortical cataracts and UVB exposure, using crude approximations of exposure and various cataract assessment techniques. A <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> of ocular exposure to UVB {{was carried out in}} a study on Chesapeake Bay Watermen, where increases in average annual ocular exposure were associated with increasing risk of cortical opacity. In this highly exposed group of predominantly white males, the evidence linking cortical opacities to sunlight exposure was the strongest to date. Based on these results, ozone depletion is predicted to cause hundreds of thousands of additional cataracts by 2050.|$|E

Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> of the then present status of the tokamak confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.|$|E

Hungarian military losses include 110,000 men who were conscripted from the annexed territories of Greater Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia and the deaths of 20,000–25,000 Jews conscripted for Army labor units. Civilian losses of about 80,000 include 45,500 killed in the 1944–1945 military campaign and in air attacks, and the genocide of Romani people of 28,000 persons. Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 600,000 (300,000 in the territories annexed between in 1938 and 1941, 200,000 in the pre-1938 countryside and 100,000 in Budapest). See World War II casualties.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{assessment}} of psychological trauma might {{include the use}} of self-administered psychological tests. Individuals' scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might {{include the use of}} generic tests (e.g., MMPI-2, MCMI-III, SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess posttraumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), <b>Detailed</b> <b>Assessment</b> of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} the country, in particular water quality, quantity and Watershed management faces major challenges today. Despite {{of the lack of}} systematic data limiting an accurate and <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources {{is the result of a}} lack of waste water management and agricultural run-off, causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and tourist infrastructure in drier regions; (iii) weak watershed management leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR government is in the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.|$|E

500|$|Mainstream {{prevention}} programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children {{are based on}} attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.

The programs invariably include a <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response. Some of these treatment or {{prevention programs}} are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents, as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses.

500|$|Stalingrads hull was towed from Nikolayev on 19 May 1955 {{by three}} tugs, but was driven ashore by high winds on 23 May at the {{southern}} entrance to Sevastopol Bay. She grounded on a very rocky bottom in very shallow water only about [...] from shore. A number of the ordinary methods to refloat a ship couldn't be used because she was very nearly empty and so nothing could be off-loaded and the rocky bottom meant that it couldn't be excavated out from underneath her. The first attempt used brute force provided by the cruisers [...] and Kerch to unsuccessfully tow her off. Several other attempts were made using explosive charges to create shock waves that would pivot her stern into deeper water in combination with tugs attempting to pull her around, but these were counterproductive in that several holes were blown in her sides which flooded several compartments and grounded her that much more firmly. At this time a more <b>detailed</b> <b>assessment</b> {{was made of the}} situation and 259 steel projections were discovered on the underside of her hull, left over from her launching cradles.

This toxicity rating is called the Toxic Equivalence Factor concept, or TEF.
