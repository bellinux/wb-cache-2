5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, <b>isopropanol,</b> or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of <b>isopropanol</b> to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive <b>isopropanol.</b> The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E
25|$|Alcohols Commonly {{encountered}} alcohols in {{veterinary medicine}} are <b>isopropanol</b> and methanol found in household products and ethanol from alcoholic beverages. They all pose toxicity to dogs. <b>Isopropanol</b> which {{is found in}} rubbing alcohol has twice the toxicity of ethanol; however methanol {{which can be found}} in windshield washer fluid does not have the same retinal and neuronal toxicity on dogs as it does to humans and primates due to the differences in the way its metabolite formic acid is processed.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} alcohols (e.g., <b>isopropanol,</b> 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) {{are obtained}} by hydrogenating over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the work on the}} destruction of aryl chlorides {{it has been shown that}} aliphatic chlorine and bromine compounds such as perchloroethylene, Freon (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane) and halon-2402 (1,2-dibromo-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane) can be dehalogenated by the action of radiation on alkaline <b>isopropanol</b> solutions. Again a chain reaction has been reported.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparing}} tissues for histology or histopathology, d-limonene {{is often}} used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or <b>isopropanol)</b> and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. In traditional medicine, d-limonene is marketed to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease and heartburn.|$|E
25|$|However acetyl-CoA can be {{converted}} to acetoacetate, which can decarboxylate to acetone (either spontaneously, or by acetoacetate decarboxylase). It can then be further metabolized to <b>isopropanol</b> which is excreted in breath/urine, or by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol). Acetol can {{be converted}} to propylene glycol. This converts to formate and acetate (the latter converting to glucose), or pyruvate (by two alternative enzymes), or propionaldehyde, or to L-lactaldehyde then L-lactate (the common lactate isomer). Another pathway turns acetol to methylglyoxal, then to pyruvate, or to D-lactaldehyde (via S-D-lactoyl-glutathione or otherwise) then D-lactate. D-lactate metabolism (to glucose) is slow or impaired in humans, so most of the D-lactate is excreted in the urine; thus D-lactate derived from acetone can contribute significantly to the metabolic acidosis associated with ketosis or <b>isopropanol</b> intoxication. L-Lactate can complete the net conversion of fatty acids into glucose. The first experiment to show conversion of acetone to glucose was carried out in 1951. This, and further experiments used carbon isotopic labelling. Up to 11% of the glucose can be derived from acetone during starvation in humans.|$|E
25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight alcohols of industrial importance {{are produced by}} the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, <b>isopropanol,</b> 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the sulfate ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct hydration using ethylene (ethylene hydration) or other alkenes from cracking of fractions of distilled crude oil.|$|E
25|$|From these materials, pectin is {{extracted}} by adding hot dilute acid at pH-values from 1.5 – 3.5. During {{several hours of}} extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in vacuum and the pectin then precipitated by adding ethanol or <b>isopropanol.</b> An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents).|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., <b>isopropanol,</b> 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as <b>isopropanol</b> and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E

[...] There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, <b>isopropanol,</b> furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone (...) and phenol (...) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom {{is part of a}} ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen {{also can}} be {{extracted}} ("transferred") from [...] "hydrogen-donors" [...] in place of H2 gas. Hydrogen donors, which often serve as solvents include hydrazine, dihydronaphthalene, dihydroanthracene, <b>isopropanol,</b> and formic acid.|$|E
2500|$|This {{impurity}} can {{be removed}} by recrystallisation of PPh3 from either hot ethanol or hot <b>isopropanol.</b> [...] This method capitalizes {{on the fact that}} OPPh3 is more polar and hence more soluble in polar solvents than PPh3.|$|E
2500|$|During the Tektite Project in 1969 {{there was}} a great deal of otitis externa. [...] The Diving Medical Officer devised a {{prophylaxis}} that came to be known as, [...] "Tektite Solution", equal parts of 15% tannic acid, 15% acetic acid and 50% <b>isopropanol</b> or ethanol. During Tektite ethanol was used because it was available in the lab for pickling specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Like many {{platinum}} compounds, {{chloroplatinic acid}} {{is used in}} catalysis. This compound was first reported by John Speier and colleagues from Dow Corning Corporation to catalyze the addition of silyl hydrides to olefins, hydrosilylation. [...] Early test reactions used <b>isopropanol</b> solutions of trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) with pentenes. Prior work on the addition of silanes to alkenes required radical reactions that were inefficient. As well as with Karstedt's catalyst, Speier's catalyst enjoys widespread use for hydrosilylation, the main drawback is the deliquescent properties of the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|A recent area of {{work has}} been the {{destruction}} of toxic organic compounds by irradiation; after irradiation, [...] "dioxins" [...] (polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins) are dechloroinated {{in the same way}} as PCBs can be converted to biphenyl an inorganic chloride. This is because the solvated electrons react with the organic compound to form a radical anion, which decomposes by the loss of a chloride anion. If a deoxygenated mixture of PCBs in <b>isopropanol</b> or mineral oil is irradiated with gamma rays, then the PCBs will be dechlorinated to form inorganic chloride and biphenyl. The reaction works best in <b>isopropanol</b> if potassium hydroxide (caustic potash) is added. The base deprotonates the hydroxydimethylmethyl radical to be converted into acetone and a solvated electron, as the result the G value (yield for a given energy due to radiation deposited in the system) of chloride can be increased because the radiation now starts a chain reaction, each solvated electron formed by the action of the gamma rays can now convert more than one PCB molecule. If oxygen, acetone, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride or nitrobenzene is present in the mixture, then the reaction rate is reduced. This {{work has been}} done recently in the USA, often with used nuclear fuel as the radiation source.|$|E
2500|$|Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol; {{commonly}} called <b>isopropanol)</b> is a compound with the chemical formula C3H8O. It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound {{with a strong}} odor. As an isopropyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms. [...] It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol. It has {{a wide variety of}} industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents.|$|E
2500|$|One major {{difference}} between nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes relates {{to the ability of}} each to support [...] "stripping" [...] antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes. [...] While there are well-established protocols available for stripping nitrocellulose membranes, the sturdier PVDF allows for easier stripping, and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments. [...] Another difference is that, unlike nitrocellulose, PVDF must be soaked in 95% ethanol, <b>isopropanol</b> or methanol before use. PVDF membranes also tend to be thicker and more resistant to damage during use.|$|E
2500|$|Biobutanol can be {{produced}} by fermentation of biomass by the A.B.E. process. The process uses the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{also known as the}} Weizmann organism, or [...] Clostridium beijerinckii. [...] It was Chaim Weizmann who first used C. acetobutylicum for the production of acetone from starch (with the main use of acetone being the making of Cordite) in 1916. The butanol was a by-product of this fermentation (twice as much butanol was produced). The process also creates a recoverable amount of H2 {{and a number of other}} by-products: acetic, lactic and propionic acids, <b>isopropanol</b> and ethanol.|$|E
2500|$|For {{hydrogen}}ation, {{the obvious}} source of hydrogen is H2 gas itself, which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder. The hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of H2, usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by [...] "booster pumps". Gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons {{by the process}} known as steam reforming. [...] For many applications, hydrogen is transferred from donor molecules such as formic acid, <b>isopropanol,</b> and dihydroanthracene. These hydrogen donors undergo dehydrogenation to, respectively, carbon dioxide, acetone, and anthracene. [...] These processes are called transfer hydrogenations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mobile phase}} {{composition}} {{does not have}} to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution. One example is a gradient starting at 10% methanol and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B"; A is the [...] "weak" [...] solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while B is the [...] "strong" [...] solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, solvent A is often water or an aqueous buffer, while B is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or <b>isopropanol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC {{can be divided into}} five categories, i.e., adsorption chromatography, partition chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. [...] In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, <b>isopropanol,</b> and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of [...] irregularly or spherically shaped 5 μm diameter silica particles.|$|E
