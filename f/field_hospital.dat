5|$|Bursać {{had lost}} much blood and her wound {{developed}} gangrene, which the <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> was poorly equipped to treat. She died in Vidovo Selo on 23September 1943, and was buried with military honours at Kamenica; deputy commissar Veljko Ražnatović spoke {{on behalf of}} the 10th Krajina Brigade. Bursać's final eulogy was delivered by her brother Dušan, leader of the SKOJ district committee for Drvar.|$|E
5|$|Gröning's {{application}} {{to transfer to}} a unit on the front-line was successful, and in 1944 he joined an SS unit fighting in the Ardennes. He was wounded and sent to a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> before rejoining his unit, which eventually surrendered to the British on 10 June 1945, his birthday.|$|E
5|$|National guardsmen were mobilized, {{and four}} {{emergency}} medical teams, each capable {{of setting up}} a small <b>field</b> <b>hospital,</b> were on standby. Also, at Eglin Air Force Base, about 20,000military personnel were evacuated, and at Hurlburt Field, home to Air Force's 16th Special Operations Wing, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for all 15,000airmen and their families.|$|E

5|$|The {{school was}} founded in 1864 as Mr. Tracy's School. In 1866, after David A. Holbrook {{purchased}} the school, it became known as Dr. Holbrook's Military School. The school ran until 1915, after which it was used in World War I as a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> and headquarters to a New York Guard regiment. From 1919 until at least 1927, the school served as the Teachers College Country Club.|$|E
5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover the guns, and at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, {{as well as the}} guns and <b>field</b> <b>hospital.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of the two <b>field</b> <b>hospitals</b> Henry's forces had {{suffered}} moderate losses which came to just over 600, as result the Siege of Amiens became known as the Siege of Velvet.

5|$|During the Battle of Uman (15 July – 8 August 1941) Strachwitz {{received}} {{a head injury}} on 29 July and was hit again by shrapnel in the arm the next day. He received first aid {{in the field and}} stayed with his men. The injured arm became infected and he had to receive medical attention in a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> on 10 August. He released himself again on 12 August returning to the regiment which had been led by Oberleutnant von Kleist during his absence.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} the Japanese {{had opened up}} with the artillery that they had brought up {{in support of the}} main defensive position on Tsimba Ridge, firing {{for the first time in}} the sector. This barrage was largely ineffective, inflicting only one casualty, as many of the shells proved to be faulty and did not detonate. The Australians also came across a large camp, including a <b>field</b> <b>hospital,</b> which they captured intact. Another group of huts was also discovered, from where they gained intelligence identifying the Japanese troops in the area as belonging to the 81st Infantry Regiment. They also managed to capture two 70mm guns, and ammunition for them.|$|E
5|$|In late April 1917, Whittle {{spent three}} days in a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> {{receiving}} treatment for psoriasis, before embarking for England on attachment to a training battalion. Joining the unit on 6 May, he once again underwent an eight-day furlough in a military hospital later in the month. During this time, Whittle attended an investiture ceremony in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated by King GeorgeV with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 the Soviet forces {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The last defenders {{in the area of}} the bunker complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker, with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{became a}} Partisan in February 1943, joining {{the newly formed}} 10th Krajina Brigade. With the brigade, she fought in the Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika and Livno areas {{and served as a}} nurse. In September 1943, Bursać was wounded in the leg while {{throwing}} hand grenades during an attack on the German base at Prkosi in northwestern Bosnia. As she was being transported to a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> at Vidovo Selo, she sang Partisan songs. Bursać's wound soon developed gangrene, and she died at the hospital on 23September 1943. She was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia the following month. Schools, streets and organisations were named in her memory following the war, commemorating her service to the Partisan cause.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E

5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a <b>field</b> <b>hospital,</b> before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a <b>field</b> <b>hospital.</b> I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless {{played a crucial}} role in the siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha wanted to take over the poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman <b>field</b> <b>hospital,</b> which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried to take over the city in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading them to believe that the city had ammunition to spare.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Trunajaya's forces harassed the loyalist army. They had {{fortified}} posts {{along the}} river, {{especially on the}} east bank. These were equipped with cannons of various sizes up to twelve-pounders. Trunajaya's artillery continuously pounded the loyalists, even reaching Hurdt and Amangkurat's lodgings, {{as well as the}} army's <b>field</b> <b>hospital.</b> The loyalist army also had cannons, but it did not return fire, saving its limited ammunition for the eventual attack on Kediri. In addition, Trunajaya's cavalry also engaged in skirmishes with the loyalists, causing casualties and undermining their morale. On 21 October, a night attack led by Raden Suradipa burned the VOC's Malay troops' quarters. However, the attack was repelled and Suradipa, one of Trunajaya's brothers, was fatally wounded. On the night of 2–3 November, Trunajaya's skirmishers intimidated the VOC's sentries with the music of gamelan and mocking voices.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg {{was killed}} in action in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF 52nd Fighter Group Spitfire {{exploded}} {{in front of him}} after a close burst of cannon fire. The Spitfire was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman. Müncheberg managed to bail out and landed severely wounded. Although the search team quickly recovered him, Müncheberg died {{on the way to a}} <b>field</b> <b>hospital.</b> Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that Sweetmann had deliberately rammed Müncheberg with his burning Spitfire. Müncheberg was buried originally at El Aouina; his remains were moved to the Heroes Cemetery at Tunis and later reinterred in the 1950s at the German Military Cemetery at Bordj-Cedria. The Wehrmachtbericht announced his death on 25 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Severely {{wounded and}} {{subsequently}} {{captured by the}} Germans, Verity {{was taken to a}} <b>field</b> <b>hospital</b> and underwent an operation. Taken by boat across the Strait of Messina to the Italian mainland, Verity first went to a hospital in Reggio Calabria and was then transported for two days by train to Naples. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at Caserta. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31 July, and was buried with full military honours. His grave was later moved from the town's cemetery to the military cemetery established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.|$|E
