5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to <b>good</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular public figure. In 1976 {{it was used to}} <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E
5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor {{would be used to}} <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E

5|$|Stigand {{was later}} accused of simony by monastic chroniclers, but all such accusations date to after 1066, {{and are thus}} suspect owing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward. The medieval chronicler William of Poitiers also claimed that in 1052 Stigand agreed that William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, should succeed King Edward. This claim was used as {{propaganda}} after the Conquest, {{but according to the}} historian David Bates, among others, it is unlikely to be true. The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall <b>good</b> <b>effect.</b> To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E
5|$|Dissidia Final Fantasy was {{originally}} envisioned by creative producer Tetsuya Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring {{a cast of}} Disney characters while the Square Enix staff were developing Kingdom Hearts II. Nomura later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters, although the original idea eventually {{gave rise to the}} development of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, with the game's multiplayer mode inspired by Dissidia's gameplay. The game was made in conmemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary and despite being handled by young employees, Nomura noticed there was no pressure, having assisted them in the designing various areas from the gameplay. The game was directed by Takeshi Arakawa whom Nomura noted that his experience in a previous Square Enix game, The World Ends With You, had a <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> in the game. In order to have their desired way of fighting, the team chose the PlayStation Portable console. There were plans for online play but the console's capacities made them unable to add such feature. Developing the game took three years due with the battle system requiring two years and the RPG mode one.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to exaggerate the <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> (of).... this twin system of Reformatory and Industrial Schools. The latter have been particularly successful in Ireland; and the combination of voluntary effort and private management, with State regulation and partial support—a rather dangerous experiment—has been completely justified by the result.|$|E

25|$|With Britten, Pears was {{a co-founder}} of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1947 and the Britten-Pears School in 1972. After Britten died in 1976, Pears {{remained}} {{an active participant in}} the festival and the school, where he was director of singing. His own voice had a distinctive timbre, not to all tastes, but such was his musical skill that he could use the voice to <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> in many styles of music.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Saqlain Mushtaq, the {{developer}} of the doosra, {{said he had}} developed a new variant called the teesra, which is a backspinner disguised as an off spinner. He {{was supposed to have}} used it in ICL matches. A teesra is a slightly round-arm delivery, having more pace than either doosra or offspinner and can surprise a batsman. It can also have <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> in limited overs cricket for containing runs.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1660s Amsterdam {{had reached}} the optimum {{population}} (about 200,000) for the level of trade, commerce and agriculture then available to support it. The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam {{was also one of}} the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to <b>good</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty four {{patients}} with severe brain injury who had disturbed behaviours preventing rehabilitation or care in ordinary settings were {{treated in a}} token economy.

50|$|Experiential {{learning}} has significant teaching advantages. Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline (1990), states that teaching {{is of utmost}} importance to motivate people. Learning only has <b>good</b> <b>effects</b> when learners have the desire to absorb the knowledge. Therefore, experiential learning requires the showing of directions for learners.|$|R
25|$|Another {{causality}} characteristic, {{shared by}} Karmic theories, {{is that like}} deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional — that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.|$|E
25|$|The VC/NVA {{also made}} {{extensive}} use of the excellent Soviet-designed rocket propelled grenade anti-tank grenade launcher, the RPG was originally designed for use against armored vehicles but it was adapted for anti-personnel use to <b>good</b> <b>effect.</b> They also made use of the Soviet/Chinese 122mm rocket which was used effectively against populated areas and large installations such as airfields. While inaccurate compared to more sophisticated weapons, the 122mm rocket made an effective terror weapon when deployed against civilian targets. Other rocket types included tube-launched Chinese 107mm and Soviet 140mm variants.|$|E
25|$|Only 3.1 overs were {{possible}} in the afternoon session due to rain. Coming back after tea, England immediately lost two wickets to Shaun Tait, who used the cloud cover to <b>good</b> <b>effect</b> and swung the ball well. However, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen batted well together for a 67-run partnership, although they were each dropped once. Towards {{the end of the}} day, Ricky Ponting brought himself on, and his medium pace yielded a wicket – that of Vaughan for 58. Overnight, the match was evenly poised with England 229 for 4.|$|E
60|$|From the two {{foregoing}} {{series of}} experiments we see, firstly, the <b>good</b> <b>effects</b> during several successive generations of a cross between distinct plants, although these were in some degree inter-related and had been grown under nearly the same conditions; and, secondly, the absence of all such <b>good</b> <b>effects</b> from a cross between flowers on the same plant; the comparison in both cases being made with the offspring of flowers fertilised with their own pollen. The experiments now to be given show how powerfully and beneficially plants, which have been intercrossed during many successive generations, having been kept all the time under nearly uniform conditions, are affected by a cross with another plant belonging to the same variety, but to a distinct family or stock, which had grown under different conditions.|$|R
