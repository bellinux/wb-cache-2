50|$|A {{computer}} {{program is a}} passive collection of <b>instructions,</b> while a <b>process</b> is the actual execution of those <b>instructions.</b> Several <b>processes</b> {{may be associated with}} the same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program often means more than one process is being executed.|$|R
5000|$|RISC makes {{pipelines}} {{smaller and}} {{much easier to}} construct by cleanly separating each stage of the <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> and making them take {{the same amount of}} time [...] - [...] one cycle. The processor as a whole operates in an assembly line fashion, with instructions coming in one side and results out the other. Due to the reduced complexity of the Classic RISC pipeline, the pipelined core and an instruction cache could be placed on the same size die that would otherwise fit the core alone on a CISC design. This was the real reason that RISC was faster. Early designs like the SPARC and MIPS often ran over 10 times as fast as Intel and Motorola CISC solutions at the same clock speed and price.|$|E
5000|$|During the 30 {{years she}} spent {{teaching}} at the Leningrad Choreographic School, Vaganova developed a ballet technique that combined elements of French, Italian, and earlier Russian technique, and a training method to teach the technique. Tenets of the training method included development of lower back strength and arm plasticity, and the strength, flexibility and endurance required for ballet, and it incorporated a detailed <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> that specified when to teach each topic and how long to teach it. In 1934, Vaganova wrote [...] "Fundamentals of the Classical Dance", which remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique. In 1948, Vaganova authored a book titled [...] "The Foundation For Dance" [...] (more commonly known as [...] "Basic Principles of Russian Classical Dance") that outlined her training method and ballet technique. Following Vaganova's death in 1951, her teaching method was preserved by instructors such as Vera Kostrovitskaya and Vera Volkova.|$|E
50|$|Farber {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a leader and authority {{on the subject of}} bibliographic instruction, he began hosting conferences on the subject at Earlham College in 1977. He developed a successful bibliographic instruction program tailored to Earlham College in its specific context. This mainly entailed integrating the instruction into specific college courses within the college’s curriculum. His five defining points of the college’s bibliographic instruction program in 1974 included flexibility and variety in the methods of instruction, the use of structured examples and illustrations in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process,</b> personalized reference services, the perception of librarians as educators, and the extension of the library’s resources to include those materials presented as much as possible. The central objectives of the program at that time were to indicate to students the differences between high school and academic libraries, to show that resources relevant to nearly any topic exist and the importance of choosing the most important and pertinent ones, to illustrate basic search strategy principles transferable to any topic, to emphasize the amount of resources that exist and the usefulness of working with a reference librarian, and to develop a readiness to search outside of the library if necessary. This approach to bibliographic instruction arose from his observations that colleges provide a particularly suitable context for both librarians and faculty to emphasize undergraduate education more than research.|$|E

This includes the reduction of volume by compressing drums containing radioactive waste in a large press. This is done in the VRF. The VRF was operated for several years but became dysfunctional due to outdated technology. Quality is one of the most important aspects of the VRF and therefore the ISO 9001 principles for quality will be applied at the facility. In order to obtain the required level of quality; the existing QMS needs to be amended by creating work <b>instructions,</b> <b>process</b> descriptions and specifications. Work <b>instructions,</b> <b>process</b> descriptions and specifications were developed for use at the VRF. A heuristic to optimise the puck packing station was developed.

We collected data through two surveys that covered a total of 1273 students and 382 teachers from southern regions of Serbia. The surveys consisted of questions about availability of computers and internet, ICT use in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process,</b> and communication habits in the ICT-empowered <b>instruction</b> <b>process.</b> The first survey covered both, students and teachers that were involved in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> mostly deprived of the ICT usage. The second survey covered participants of an <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> that was successfully improved by an ICT usage. Data analysis shows a shift in communication patterns of teachers and a sharp improvement in computer use for educational purposes for both groups included in the surveys. The change is induced by a proper ICT usage in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process.</b> Conclusions that followed the data analysis lead us to better approaches in organizing ICT usage in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> that enable participants fully employ their resources in order to improve teaching techniques and learning...|$|E

50|$|In simpler CPUs the {{instruction}} cycle is executed sequentially, each <b>instruction</b> being <b>processed</b> {{before the next}} one is started.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Current superscalar microprocessors' {{performance}} {{depends on}} its frequency {{and the number of}} useful instructions that can be processed per cycle (IPC). Higher frequency is achieved with process advancement, new circuit techniques, and microarchitectural improvement. Number of <b>instructions</b> <b>processed</b> per cycle depends mainly on microarchitecture techniques that exploit parallelism both spatially and temporally. Most techniques employed to exploit parallelism spatially tend to increase circuit complexity and may affect the frequency thus offset the performance gain intended. Finer pipeline stages exploit parallelism temporally but may suffer reduced efficiency when there are dependencies and hazards in the long pipeline. Careful balancing between frequency and useful number of <b>instructions</b> <b>processed</b> per cycle is one of the important microprocessor design tradeoffs. In this thesis we propose a method called approximation to reduce the logic delay of a pipe-stage. The basic idea of approximation is to implement the logic function partially instead of fully. Most of the time the partial implementation gives the correct result as if the function is implemented fully but with fewer gates delay allowing a higher pipeline frequency. We apply this method on three logic blocks. Simulation results show that this method provides some performance improvement for a wide-issue superscalar if these stages are finely pipelined...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares overall student {{satisfaction}} {{within and}} across disciplines in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process</b> of introductory postgraduate economic statistics with a highly heterogeneous student clientele employing non-parametric and multivariate analysis.

It underscores the vibrant reality that student diversity has changed the university environment. Effective, relevant and attractive programmes require understanding this transition. The paper’s novelty lies in its use of a range of analytical frameworks demonstrating that by explicitly addressing the heterogeneous character of student needs in the <b>instruction</b> <b>process,</b> even in quite difficult courses, overall rating can be at least on a par with other courses within and between disciplines...|$|E
