In order {{to select the}} best design method for <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> in the diesel engine assembling process, main fixed parts of some MAN low-speed marine diesel engine were analyzed based on finite element analysis software Hyperworks. The mechanical performance of bottom, frame and cylinder under {{the effect of the}} four kinds of assembling methods was investigated. Ultimately, the best assembling process was confirmed. Results indicated that the finite element analysis model was reliable and exactly. The middle to both sides assembly was the best among the four methods...|$|R

50|$|In trials, the {{vehicles}} confirmed their remarkable capability and running qualities. However the locomotives tended to derail in tight turnout curves. And, like the Class 45s, the boilers developed cracks, leaky tubes and popped <b>stay</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{so that the}} locomotives were unconvincing when hauling measurement vehicles or scheduled trains.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{fault of}} the S160 was use of a single water gauge of a Klinger design, {{unfamiliar}} to U.K. crews. If the valves were not fully open, the crews could be misled into thinking that the water level was adequate, {{even though it was}} becoming dangerously low. When a low water condition allowed the crown sheet to overheat, the <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> holding the crown sheet would fail with little warning, resulting in a boiler explosion. In a space of ten months, three UK S160s suffered a collapse of the firebox crown, with the first leading to the death of a GWR fireman on No. 2403 in November 1943. Although there are claims that the <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> or firebox design were less than for domestic locomotive boilers, the locomotives were equipped with a [...] "(b)oiler built to comply in all aspects with the A.S.M.E. Boiler Code, except that the shell shall have a factor safety of 4." ...|$|R
5000|$|No. 3094 was {{in service}} with FOTR until its {{withdrawal}} in 2007 due to failing <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> surrounding the firebox. This locomotive was awaiting its {{turn to be}} overhauled in 2011 and was back in service by 2015.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had bar {{frames and}} used saturated steam. They had balanced slide valves, arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Stephenson valve gear through rocker shafts. The firebox was fitted with Stroudley's <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> {{and the back}} casing plate was flanged outwards to facilitate {{the removal of the}} internal firebox for renewals.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{launch of}} the Naro-1 took place on [...] The rocket was {{launched}} from the Naro Space Center. The Khrunichev-built first stage reportedly performed nominally, and the second stage separation took place as expected, but the payload fairing separation system malfunctioned {{and half of the}} satellite protective cover <b>stayed</b> <b>bolted</b> to the second stage. The added weight of the remaining fairing caused the rocket to tumble upwards and to be thrown off its nominal course, soaring 20 km above the planned altitude before falling down. The payload (STSAT-2) reentered the atmosphere and disintegrated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{proved to}} be powerful and capable, with reserves of power at speed and reasonable fuel economy. The turbine drive was easy on the track and allowed more power at the rail. While economical at speed, the locomotive was highly uneconomical at lower speed. The turbine used less steam than conventional locomotives above 30 mph, but below that the locomotive used too much steam and fuel. The boiler normally operated at , but at low speed the pressure could drop as low as [...] The increased fuel usage at low speeds caused the firebox to run hotter, which sometimes caused <b>stay</b> <b>bolts</b> to break.|$|R
50|$|A feature {{which was}} to be {{followed}} for all subsequent SAR locomotives was their relatively large firegrate area of 37 sq ft. The round-topped firebox had <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> fitted in the breaking zones. Three support brackets tied the boiler barrel to the main bar frames. As far as practicable, mountings were fixed to a steam stand on the firebox top and fitted with extensions to the spindles to carry the handles inside the cab, within easy reach of the enginemen.|$|R
50|$|Eventually all thirty Class 16C {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2B boilers and reclassified to Class 16CR. Several alterations to {{the engine}} frames were necessary to accommodate the no. 2B boiler. Bearing brackets had to be provided on the bridle casting to suit the firebox support sliding shoes fitted {{at the front of}} the firebox foundation ring. The frame had to be altered to suit the new wider Watson cab with its slanted front to allow access to the lagging which covered the <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> and stay caps on the firebox sides.|$|R
50|$|The boilers were of {{outstanding}} proportions {{to enable the}} locomotives to cope with one particular bank on the Zeerust line which required continuous steaming for 75 minutes. The boiler barrel and outer firebox shell was made of nickel steel plates while the steel inner firebox was <b>stayed</b> with <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>stays,</b> the <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> arranged at suitable positions along the side and back plates and also along the two front rows of the firebox crown. The firebox tube plate and inner back plate {{were similar to those}} of the Class GL. The firebox was fitted with two Nicholson thermic syphons to increase water circulation and also to provide additional heating surface. In addition, two arch tubes leading from the tube plate to the back plate provided more heating surface while supporting the brick arch.|$|R

This archwire was prominently used {{in what is}} known as Begg Technique. Begg was seeking a stainless steel wire that was light, <b>flexible</b> <b>stayed</b> active {{for long periods of time}} in the mouth. The wire had high resiliency and toughness and were heat treated. The initial wire produced had dimension of 0.018in. These wires are often used in the treatment of deep bites because of their increased resistance to permanent deformation. The wire is composed of Iron (64%), Chromium (17%), Nickel (12%) and others.|$|R

50|$|The firebox had a {{power-operated}} Ajax fire-door and {{the grate}} {{was of the}} sectional pin-hole type, fitted with power-operated shaking gear. To assist in keeping within the axle load limits, the ashpan was constructed of relatively thin anti-corrosive steel plates of a special heat-resisting quality. The brick arch was supported by five 3 in diameter arch tubes. The firebox was fitted with SAR standard type <b>flexible</b> <b>stays</b> and to allow easier access to the stays, the engine was equipped with a Watson cab with its slanted front which, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become the standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes. The cab was of special light steel and was welded throughout.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the {{original}} Class 12A boilers, initial and in-service repair cost considerations {{led to the}} Loubser boiler being built without a combustion chamber. The round-top firebox was radially stayed and the first two rows of <b>stays</b> were <b>flexible.</b> Similar <b>stays</b> were fitted in the side, back and throat plates and in the breaking zones.

40|$|A protein, Tm 1631 {{from the}} hyperthermophilic {{organism}} Thermotoga maritima {{belongs to a}} domain of unknown function protein family. It was predicted that Tm 1631 binds with the DNA and that the Tm 1631 –DNA complex is an endonuclease repair system with a DNA repair function (Konc et al. PLoS Comput Biol 9 (11) : e 1003341, 2013). We observed that the severely bent, strained DNA binds to the protein for the entire 90 ns of classical molecular dynamics (MD) performedwe could observe no {{significant changes in the}} most distorted region of the DNA, where the cleavage of phosphodiester bond occurs. In this article, we modeled the reaction mechanism at the interface between Tm 1631 and its proposed ligand, the DNA molecule, focusing on cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. After addition of two Mg 2 + ions to the reaction center and extension of classical MD by 50 ns (totaling 140 ns), the DNA ligand <b>stayed</b> <b>bolted</b> to the protein. Results from density functional theory quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations suggest that the reaction is analogous to known endonuclease mechanisms: an enzyme reaction mechanism with two Mg 2 + ions in the reaction center and a pentacovalent intermediate. The minimum energy pathway profile shows that the phosphodiester bond cleavage step of the reaction is kinetically controlled and not thermodynamically {{because of a lack of}} any energy barrier above the accuracy of the energy profile calculation. The role of ions is shown by comparing the results with the reaction mechanisms in the absence of the Mg 2 + ions where there is a significantly higher reaction barrier than in the presence of the Mg 2 + ions...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} report (Bulletin of the Naniwa University, Series B, Vol. 4, 1954, p. 35 - 67) the author described the vibration experiments {{of a power}} tiller in the stationary various states. In this paper, the author tried the theoretical analysis {{on the characteristics of}} the free vibrations and forced vibrations on the frame and the handle of power tiller, and calculated the natural frequencies of the frame and the handle, and discussed the forced vibrations on the running and the cultivating states. Further, the author measured, in the field, the vibrations on the running and cultivating states, by a wire resistance type vibrometer designed and constructed by our laboratory. In view of very important feature to prevent the handle vibration, the author attempted the decrease the natural frequency of the handle to avoid the resonance with the exciting force of the engine. There are two different methods to decrease theoretically the natural frequency of the handle, namely (a) a method in which the length or the sectional area of pipe constructing the handle is increased, (b) a method in which the <b>flexible</b> <b>stay</b> is used. The latter method is better than the former for practical purposes, therefore the author applied the latter method practically, and obtained satisfactory results in both the stationary and the field tests...|$|R

40|$|Free {{vibrations}} of a taut cable with an attached passive Targeted-Energy-Transfer (TET) device are investigated {{using an}} analytical {{formulation of the}} complex generalized eigenvalue problem. This problem is of considerable practical interest {{in the context of}} stay-cable vibration suppression in bridges, induced by wind, rain–wind and parametric excitation. The TET device is a nonlinear apparatus, which has been investigated and successfully ap- plied to the vibration suppression in several structural or mechanical systems. This study proposes, for the first time, the use of the TET device as a simple passive apparatus for stay-cable vibration mitigation. In this applica- tion, the device was modelled as a dashpot with a viscous damper in parallel with a power-law nonlinear elastic spring element and a lumped mass restrained to one end. The ‘flexibility of the support’ (imperfect anchorage to the deck) was also simulated by placing an elastic support (linear elastic spring) in series between the dashpot and the deck. The study derives a new family of ‘universal design curves’ for the TET device, by accounting for the effects of nonlinear elastic stiffness, lumped mass and flexibility of the support. To verify the adequacy of the universal curves and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the TET devices, parametric numerical simulations were per- formed on a reference stay cable. As an application example, analytical results were employed to design the dampers of one <b>flexible</b> <b>stay,</b> installed on an existing cable-stayed bridge.
