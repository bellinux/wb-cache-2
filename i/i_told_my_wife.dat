25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that we have three boys and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger {{ended their}} {{relationship}} after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver {{moving out of}} the couple's Brentwood mansion. On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than fourteen years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia 'Patty' Baena. [...] "After leaving the governor's office <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> about this event, which occurred over a decade ago," [...] Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to The Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after Shriver had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.|$|E

5000|$|If TV {{can tell}} the truth, as you say it can, you'll see that I was smiling. But I think if you come in close, you'll see some tears coming down because I knew he had gotten me there.

2500|$|The book is {{dedicated}} [...] "To the Wife of My Youth". This dedication {{appears in the}} first printing run of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; then I began to receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. I laughed at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E
60|$|When I reached home <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{the story}} of my friend Barbel. She listened with a sad and eager interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard a yellin' {{around the}} ice-houses, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I'd dress and {{come over and}} see what it meant. Hope you ain't done no damage," [...] the man continued, {{somewhat}} anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, no,' said I; 'as <b>I</b> {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> of course <b>I</b> shall not tell him. I am much obliged {{to you for}} your {{willingness}} to stay. It would be very awkward if you should go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had only}} one regret in leaving Europe, {{and that was that}} my {{faithful}} friend, the noble and devoted invisible dog, was obliged to remain {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. Why this was so I do not know, but perhaps it was for the best. <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> of his existence, and if she had accidentally discovered it, I know not what might have been the effects upon her nervous system.|$|R
5000|$|Reagan ran {{for reelection}} in 1984. The Democratic nominee was Walter Mondale. Reagan {{performed}} poorly {{in the first}} debate, but rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I {{am not going to}} exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself. Mondale later recalled that [...] If TV can tell the truth, as you say it can, you'll see that I was smiling. But I think if you come in close, you'll see some tears coming down because I knew he had gotten me there.

60|$|Going {{back to the}} eating-chamber, in a {{few words}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and the guests how the matter stood, praying the oldest man among the latter to take my place by the bride, which he did unwillingly, muttering {{that this was an}} unlucky {{marriage}} feast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as I've got {{any right}} to trouble you with this thing," [...] he said, in the moment while Sewell sat pondering the case, [...] "and I don't know as I've got any warrant for doing it. But, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> here, there was {{something}} about you--I don't know whether it was anything you SAID exactly--that made me feel as if you could help us. I guess I didn't say so much as that to her; but that's the way I felt. And here we are. And if it ain't all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 263. Then {{with joy}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> O now I know, I know! But {{that night was}} a good night to me, I never had but few better; I longed for the company of some of God's people that I might have {{imparted}} unto them what God had showed me. Christ was a precious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy, and peace, and triumph, through Christ; this great glory did not continue upon me until morning, yet that twelfth of the author to the Hebrews (Heb 12:22,23) was a blessed scripture to me for many days together after this.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{being asked}} whether Bishop Iriney's actions made him suspicious, Trofimoff responded, [...] "No, {{not in the}} beginning. I said I needed money. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> bought some {{furniture}} and I can't pay for it, I don't {{know how to get}} the money. And he says, 'I tell you what, I'll loan it to you.' So he gave me, I think, 5,000 marks and then, it wasn't enough, because I needed more, and about three or four weeks later I said to him, 'You gotta help me one more time, and I'll give it back to you when I have a chance.' And {{that was the end of}} it. Then he talked to me a couple times. Always like this. Then he says, 'Well, you know, I'll tell you what. You don't owe me any money. And if you need some more, I can give you some more. Don't worry about it. You're going to have to have a few things, this and that.' And this is how it started." ...|$|R
5000|$|A large {{bird's-eye view}} of Los Angeles is shown with {{searchlights}} moving to a conga beat. The action {{takes place in the}} famed Ciro's nightclub, where the Hollywood stars are having dinner — at $50 ($ today) a plate and [...] "easy terms". The first stars seen are Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche, and, at a table behind them, Adolphe Menjou and Norma Shearer, followed by Cary Grant, seated alone. Grant talks to himself: [...] "What a place! What a place! It's as pretty as a picture. But if <b>I</b> ever <b>told</b> <b>my</b> favorite <b>wife</b> the awful truth I'd land right on the front page. Yessireee Bobby." [...] (All these jokes are references to some of his films, although The Front Page was retitled His Girl Friday after it was mostly completed.) ...|$|R
60|$|Still, I must go {{upon the}} king's business, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> this to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> Macropha, {{the mother of}} Nada, and, as it was thought, of Umslopogaas, the son of Chaka. But when I spoke to Macropha of the matter she burst into tears and clung to me. I asked her why she wept thus, and she {{answered}} that the shadow of evil lay upon her heart, for she was sure that if I left her at the king's kraal, when I returned again I should find neither her nor Nada, my child, nor Umslopogaas, who was named my son, and whom I loved as a son, still {{in the land of}} life. Then I tried to calm her; but the more I strove the more she wept, saying that she knew well that these things would be so.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{she was a}} fool; bade Mrs. Barry not be uneasy, and was hot upon going: I {{would take}} no denial from either party. How I {{was to get the}} money to go was the question; but that was solved by my good mother, who was always ready to help me on a pinch, and who {{produced}} sixty guineas from a stocking. This was all the ready money that Barry Lyndon, of Castle Lyndon, and married to a fortune of forty thousand a year, could command: such had been the havoc made in this fine fortune by my own extravagance (as I must confess), but chiefly by my misplaced confidence and the rascality of others.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that I {{had caught}} three burglars, {{and they were}} fast bound in the library, she nearly fainted; and when I had revived her she begged me to promise that I would not go downstairs again until the police had carried away the horrible wretches. But I assured {{her that it was}} {{absolutely}} necessary for me to return to the library. She then declared that she would go with me, and if anything happened she would share my fate. [...] "Besides," [...] she said, [...] "if they are tied fast so they can't move, I should like to see what they look like. I never saw a burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{were all}} the other rich creeks. Listen! It's big. Only eight to twenty feet to bedrock. There won't be a claim that don't run to half a million. It's a dead secret. Two or three of my close friends let me in on it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> right away that I {{was going to find}} you before I started. Now, so long. My pack's hidden down the bank. In fact, when they told me, they made me promise not to pull out until Dawson was asleep. You know what it means if you're seen with a stampeding outfit. Get your partner and follow. You ought to stake fourth or fifth claim from Discovery. Don't forget--Squaw Creek. It's the third after you pass Swede Creek." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{might be}} some truth in this, I thought: at any rate, when rogues fall out, honest men come by their own: and now I began to suspect, I am sorry to say, that both the {{attorney}} and the Director had {{a little of the}} rogue in their composition. It was especially about <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> fortune that Mr. B. showed his cloven foot: for proposing, as usual, that I should purchase shares with it in our Company, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was a minor, and as such her little fortune was vested out of my control altogether. He flung away in a rage at this; and I soon saw that he did not care for me any more, by Abednego's manner to me. No more holidays, no more advances of money, had I: on the contrary, the private clerkship at 150l. was abolished, and I found myself on my 250l. a year again. Well, what then? it was always a good income, and I did my duty, and laughed at the Director.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't exert yourself," [...] he said. [...] "I'll put {{all your}} {{questions}} for you. What have I been about? Why do I look so remarkably well off? And {{how in the}} world did I find my way to this house? My dear girl, I have been occupied, since we last saw each other, in slightly modifying my old professional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical Agriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on the public stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach--look them both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty, and you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing. However that may be, here I am--incredible as it may appear--a man with an income, at last. The founders of my fortune are three in number. Their names are Aloes, Scammony, and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am now living--on a Pill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my friendly connection with you. I made a little more by the happy decease (Requiescat in Pace!) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge's from whom, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> had expectations. Very good. What do you think I did? I invested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in advertisements, and purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The result is now before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am, with my clothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker's; with my servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent, flourishing, popular--and all on a Pill." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is in {{the nature}} of such a simple soul as Thomas Newcome, to see but one side of a question, and having once fixed Ethel's worldliness in his mind, and her brother's treason, to allow no {{argument}} of advocates of the other side to shake his displeasure. Hence the one or two appeals which Laura ventured to make on behalf of her friend, were checked by the good Colonel with a stern negation. If Ethel was not guiltless, she could not make him see at least that she was not guilty. He dashed away all excuses and palliations. Exasperated as he was, he persisted in regarding the poor girl's conduct in its most unfavourable light. [...] "She was rejected, and deservedly rejected, by the Marquis of Farintosh," [...] he broke out to me once, who was not indeed authorised to tell all I knew regarding the story; [...] "the whole town knows it; all the clubs ring with it. I blush, sir, to think that my brother's child should have brought such a stain upon our name." [...] In vain, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him that <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> who knew all the circumstances much better, judged Miss Newcome far more favourably, and indeed greatly esteemed and loved her. [...] "Pshaw! sir," [...] breaks out the indignant Colonel, [...] "your wife is an innocent creature, who does not know the world as we men of experience do,--as I do, sir;" [...] and would have no more of the discussion. There is no doubt about it, there was a coolness between my old friend's father and us.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{went home}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{about it as}} well as I could, but, though she entered into the spirit of it, she was rather preoccupied. The {{children}} had all wakened, as they did sometimes, in a body, and were storming joyfully around the rooms, as if it were Christmas; and she was trying to get them dressed. 'Do tell them what Easter is like; they've never seen it kept before,' she said; and I tried to do so, while I took a hand, as a young father will, and tried to get them into their clothes. I don't think I dwelt much on the religious observance of the day, but I dug up some of my profane associations with it in early life, and told them about coloring eggs, and fighting them, and all that; there in New England, in those days, they had never seen or heard of such a thing as an Easter egg.|$|E
60|$|When I {{came to my}} own house, {{for which}} I was forced to inquire, one of the {{servants}} opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a gate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise {{never be able to}} reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, {{as if they had been}} pigmies and I a giant. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.” In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion when he first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't see it properly," [...] muttered Potts, [...] "windows want washing, haven't {{been done}} since my wife died, and that's twenty years ago. Miss her very much, of course, but thank God there's no spring-cleaning now. The things I've seen broken in spring-cleaning! yes, and lost, too. It was {{after one of}} them that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that now I {{understood}} why the Mahomedans declare that women have no souls. When she came to understand what I meant, which {{it took her a}} long time to do, we had a row, a regular row, and she threw a Dresden figure at my head. Luckily I caught it, having been a cricketer when young. Well, she's gone now, and no doubt heaven's a tidier place than it used to be--that is, if they will stand her rummagings there, which I doubt. Look at that Venus, ain't she a beauty? Might have been done by Titian when his paints ran out, and he had to take to a hot iron to express his art. What, you can't see her well? Wait a bit and I'll get a lantern. Can't have a naked candle here--things too valuable; no money could buy them again. My wife and I had another row about naked candles, or {{it may have been a}} paraffin lamp.

When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her of <b>my</b> promise to Cheeko, she said flatly that she wouldn't lift a paw to help an idle fellow who was always finding fault with everybody instead of getting in his winter's supply of nuts; but after hearing how badly off he was, she took it all back and set about making the herb tea.|$|R

6000|$|Sometimes, as he {{was walking}} briskly along the street, with little Pansie {{clasping}} his hand, and perhaps frisking rather more than became a person of his venerable years, he had met the grim old wreck of Colonel Dabney, moving goutily, and gathering wrath anew with every touch of his painful foot to the ground; or driving by in his carriage, showing an ashen, angry, wrinkled face at the window, and frowning at him--the apothecary thought--with a peculiar fury, as if he took umbrage at his audacity in being less broken by age than a gentleman like himself. The apothecary could not help feeling {{as if there were}} some unsettled quarrel or dispute between himself and the Colonel, he could not tell what or why. The Colonel always gave him a haughty nod of half-recognition; and the people in the street, to whom he was a familiar object, would say, [...] "The worshipful Colonel begins to find himself mortal like the rest of us. He feels his years." [...] "He'd be glad, I warrant," [...] said one, [...] "to change with you, Doctor. It shows what difference a good life makes in men, to look at him and you.
