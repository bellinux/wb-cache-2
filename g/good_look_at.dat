5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't get a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the creature, he describes it {{to the rest of the}} team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E

25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could get a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the monster up close.|$|E

25|$|Dominic Kinnear {{states that}} the first time the Earthquakes {{coaching}} staff first got a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Brian Ching was facing him in the July 17, 2002 third round match of the U.S. Open Cup when San Jose defeated the Seattle Sounders 4-3 after sudden death extra time. Kinnear, assistant coach at the time, and head coach Frank Yallop were impressed with how Ching matched up with Earthquakes defender Eddie Robinson, considered one of the best defenders in MLS at the time. Ching began training with the Earthquakes the following January. On February 11, 2003, San Jose traded Devin Barclay to D.C. United in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2003 MLS Supplemental Draft and on February 28, 2013, they used that pick to draft Ching.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to get a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Venegas {{strung out}} his {{soldiers}} along a northeast to southwest ridge. Three infantry battalions and four cavalry regiments formed an advance guard {{to watch the}} approach of the French from Tribaldos village. Four battalions defended the town of Uclés in the center with remaining cavalry and the four guns in front. Eight battalions held the right flank, while six battalions deployed on the left flank. Venegas held only a single battalion in reserve; the rest of his units formed a single overextended line. On 13 January, Victor marched from Tarancón at dawn in two columns. Victor with Villatte's and most of Latour-Maubourg's divisions took the right-hand road, which was more direct. Ruffin's division and some cavalry took the left-hand road. Villatte quickly drove the advance guard out of Tribaldos; it fell back to the main Spanish position. After getting a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Spanish line, Victor ordered Ruffin to swing to the right and take Venegas in flank and rear.|$|E

[...] GamePro noted the lack of new bonus content, and said, [...] "3D doesn't necessarily radically redefine the experience. It does, however, make things like boss fights and magical effects much more mesmerizing", but added that, [...] "all of the in-game cinematics are not in 3D, which is... unfortunate considering how cutscenes are such {{an integral part of}} the storytelling in any God of War game". By June 2012, God of War: Origins Collection had sold 711,737 copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Roland Kickinger as The Terminator / T-800 (Model 101): {{the first}} Terminator covered in living tissue. Bodybuilder and actor Kickinger, who {{previously}} portrayed Schwarzenegger in the 2005 biographical film See Arnold Run, was his physical double on set. When {{asked about his}} role, Kickinger said it is [...] "Arnold's character in the first Terminator. That's basically my role, but 20 years before, so it establishes how the Terminator came about." [...] Polish strongman athlete Mariusz Pudzianowski was also considered for doubling Schwarzenegger. If Schwarzenegger {{had decided not to}} lend his appearance to the film, then John would have shot the T-800s face off before the audience got a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks {{through a hole in the}} door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E

500|$|Gladys Knight & the Pips {{recorded}} [...] "Grapevine" [...] on June 17, 1967 in Motown's Studio A, with Norman Whitfield as producer. After hearing Aretha Franklin's {{version of}} [...] "Respect", Whitfield rearranged [...] "Grapevine" [...] {{to include some}} of the funk elements of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. According to David Ritz, Whitfield set to record a song that would [...] "out-funk" [...] Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, Gladys Knight, Bubba Knight, William Guest, and Edward Patten worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, {{the first line of}} the second verse ("I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside") was altered to ("Take a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside"). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967 on Motown's Soul label.|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, public {{appearances}} by Talbot included headlining the Great Bridge Christmas and Winter Festival, which local police threatened to cancel unless crowds clamouring {{to reach the}} tent in which Talbot was performing could be brought under control. At the event, on 7 December 2007, Talbot said [...] "I love it here, it's brilliant, really fun", but had to be ushered off-stage by the police. Talbot performed publicly in Walsall's HMV store, and in Birmingham's Centenary Square. TV appearances included GMTV and Channel 5 news, both on 26 November 2007. According to her mother, Talbot has received offers for film roles. Sharon said [...] "'s been sent a script, I haven't had a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it yet but it's really exciting...

She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well take a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges."

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a <b>good</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt).

500|$|In March 1996, Gallagher and {{his brother}} Liam met their father again when the News of the World paid {{him to go to}} their hotel during a tour. He left for his room, later commenting [...] "as far as I'm concerned, I haven't got a father. He's not a father to me, y'know? I don't respect him in any way whatsoever". In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the {{worldwide}} success of Morning Glory?, Be Here Now (1997) became Oasis' most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album {{failed to live up to}} long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards Be Here Now was short-lived. The album was ultimately regarded by many as a bloated, over-indulgent version of Oasis, which Gallagher has since blamed on the drug-addicted state and indifference of the band at the time. While the album was a record breaker, selling 660,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album's popularity, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any <b>good.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Phil Collins." ...|$|E
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} hold differing {{opinions about}} the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was [...] "talking down" [...] Be Here Now in the music press, describing the production as [...] "bland", and remarking {{that some of the}} tracks were [...] "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any <b>good.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." ...|$|E
