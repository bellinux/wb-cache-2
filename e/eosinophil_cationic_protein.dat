Supernatants from eosinophils, but not neutrophils, were toxic to rat heart cells in a dose-dependent manner. This was {{associated with an increased}} O 2 uptake, which was blocked by either 1 mM-cyanide or 100 microM-ouabain. Supernatants from eosinophils, but not neutrophils, caused a decrease in O 2 uptake by rat heart mitochondria utilizing pyruvate (+ malate) but not other substrates. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 4. 1) from rat heart was inhibited by Ca 2 +-free eosinophil supernatants. The activity of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 4. 2) was also inhibited but not that of lipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1. 6. 4. 3). Prior incubation with heparin prevented these effects of eosinophil supernatants on heart cells, suggesting that they were caused by <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Other <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins,</b> including poly-L-lysine and poly-L-arginine were also toxic to rat heart cells, but these reduced O 2 uptake. It was concluded that granulocyte secretion products containing <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> are toxic to isolated rat heart cells in vitro. This may be due to an initial increase in membrane permeability, which may lead to activation of (Na+ + K+) -dependent ATPase and increased O 2 uptake.

Eosinophil accumulation and degranulation at local inflammatory sites is a feature of asthma, allergic rhinitis and nasal polyposis. Eosinophils and their granule proteins have been implicated in cell and tissue remodelling and have been shown to communicate with other cell types at inflammatory sites, including epithelial cells and nerve cells. The HER family of receptors, including HER 1 and HER 2 are activated by EGF ligands. They are upregulated in rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis and in several human cancers.

40|$|AbstractExercise-induced asthma is {{a common}} phenomenon, the {{mechanism}} of which is undetermined. Eosinophils have been suggested as {{playing a role in}} its occurrence. We studied the effect of exercise-induced asthma on the cellular and mediator composition of spontaneously obtained sputum. Twenty-five patients with bronchial asthma were investigated by studying sputum spontaneously obtained before and following challenge. One group with (n= 9) and one without (n= 9) exercise-induced asthma performed exercise challenge. A third group (n= 7) performed methacholine challenge. The sputum was analysed using Giemsa staining for differential cell count, measuring <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> and mixtures of leukotrienes (D 4, E 4 and C 4) in the liquid phase using ELISA. The group with exercise-induced asthma had a mean drop of 23 · 7 ± 7 · 4 % in FEV 1, significantly (P= 0 · 001) higher than the group without it. Following challenges, there were significant increases in sputum eosinophils only in the group with exercise-induced asthma (from 8 · 1 ± 13 · 9 % to 18 · 3 ± 20 · 2 %, P= 0 · 0017) and not in control groups (from 0 · 9 ± 0 · 9 % to 1 · 5 ± 1 · 5 %) or in those who had methacholine challenge (from 23 · 6 ± 27 · 2 % to 22 · 3 ± 23 · 8 %). <b>Eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> did not change significantly in any group. In the liquid phase of the sputum, the amount of leukotrienes increased following exercise in six of the seven patients with exercise-induced asthma in whom it was measured.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the factors contributing to eosinophil migration and potential anti-neoplastic effects on OSC. Eosinophil degranulation was evaluated by measuring release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). Eosinophil chemotaxis towards OSC cells was assessed using artificial basement membrane. Eosinophil infiltration was prominent within the tissue surrounding the OSC tumor mass. We observed growth inhibition of the OSC cell line, SCC- 9, during co-culture with human eosinophils, in vitro, which correlated with EPO activity that possesses growth inhibitory activity.

However, the mechanism of Der p 2 on NLRP 3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of CPPecp on inhibition of Der p 2 induced inflammasome activation. We showed that proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from HDM allergic patients after Der p 2 stimulation. Expression of NLRP 3, ASC, Caspase- 1, IL- 1 β and Caspase- 1 activity was upregulated in THP- 1 cells after Der p 2 stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokine production, NLRP 3 inflammasome activation and caspase- 1 activity were downregulated in THP- 1 cells and CD 14 + cells co-cultured with Der p 2 and CPPecp. The immunomodulatory effect of CPPecp was through upregulation of IFN-α production but not induction of autophagy.

Release of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> {{is thought to}} be responsible for epithelial damage. In this study, human peripheral blood eosinophil and human lung mast cell (HLMC) adhesion to bronchial epithelium were investigated. A high proportion of HLMC adhered to epithelial cell monolayers compared to eosinophils. In both cases, adhesion was cation-independent, and was not inhibited by function-blocking ICAM- 1 mAb, despite increased basal epithelial ICAM- 1 expression upon cytokine activation.;HLMC adhesion was not modulated by function blocking mAb to cell adhesion molecule families, preincubation with carbohydrates, HLMC activation (SCF or TGF-P), or epithelial activation (cytokines). A significant reduction in adhesion was observed upon pretreatment with anti-IgE, pronase, -galactosidase or endo [...] N-acetylgalactosaminidase (HLMC) or 4 % paraformaldehyde (epithelium). No evidence for galectin involvement in adhesion was observed.;Eosinophil adhesion to alveolar epithelium was not modulated by eosinophil activation with PAF. Adhesion to bronchial epithelium was enhanced upon activation of both eosinophils (Mn 2 +) and epithelium (cytomix). A proportion of the enhanced adhesion was 2 (CD 18) integrin-mediated.;In conclusion, the adhesion mechanisms of mast cells and eosinophils to bronchial epithelium were different, possibly relating to their divergent in vivo functions. The differences in proportions of adherent mast cells and eosinophils to bronchial epithelium during asthma may result in the widely documented lack of mast cells compared to eosinophils in sputum and BAL in vivo. ...|$|R

In the adult lung, the BMP pathway is activated during airway inflammation. However, a role for activated BMP signalling {{has not yet been}} elucidated. The aims of this project were to identify a role for BMP signalling in adult airway epithelial cells (AECs) and to further investigate BMP signalling during airway inflammation. AECs used included the transformed bronchial cell line, BEAS- 2 B, the adenocarcinoma-derived cell line, A 549, and normal primary murine airway epithelial cells (MAECs). BMP 2 and BMP 4 inhibited E-cadherin expression in BEAS- 2 B cells. In addition, BMP 4 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BEAS- 2 B where cells acquired a mesenchymal phenotype including fibroblast-like morphology and increased mesenchymal gene expression. Investigation of BMP 4 -mediated signalling in A 549 cells revealed hydrocortisone (HC) as a determining factor where in the presence of HC A 549 cells adopted a senescent-like phenotype {{and in the absence of}} HC cells underwent an EMT-like change in phenotype in the response to BMP 4. Further analysis of BMP 4 -mediated effects in normal primary MAECs revealed downregulation of E-cadherin expression and a concurrent increase in expression of the transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, Snail 1. To further investigate the involvement of BMP signalling in airway inflammation, BMP pathway components were assessed in nasal biopsies from individuals with allergic rhinitis (AR). In AR nasal biopsies, the BMP pathway was found to be modulated with the apparent relocalisation of the BMP receptor, BMPR-IA, to the nucleus of airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, this nuclear localisation was recapitulated in normal primary MAECs co-cultured with eosinophils or stimulated with <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins.</b> These data further implicate BMP signalling in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation where activated BMP signalling may be involved in remodelling processes...|$|R

In the present investigation these eosinophil granule proteins were studied in the conjunctiva of patients with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP).  METHODS—Conjunctival biopsy specimens obtained from patients with subacute (n= 8) or chronic conjunctival disease (n= 13) were analysed histologically and immunohistochemically using antibodies directed against EG 1 (stored and secreted ECP), EG 2 (secreted ECP), MBP, CD 45 (common leucocyte antigen), CD 3 (pan T cell marker), and HLA-DR (class II antigen).  RESULTS—Subepithelial mononuclear cells, mast cells, and neutrophils were detected in all specimens. The number of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, CD 45 + cells, CD 3 + cells, and the HLA-DR expression were significantly higher in the subacute than in the chronic disease group. Some eosinophils were found in specimens from five of eight patients with subacute OCP, but in none of the patients with chronic disease.

Specifically, (pancreatic) RNase A, an enzyme of about 120 residues, {{has been one of}} the most widely studied enzyme in various fields of research, ranging from protein folding to cancer therapy. RNase A belongs to a superfamily named after itself. Among the members of this superfamily are angiogenin, <b>eosinophils</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>protein</b> (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, seminal-RNase and onconase. RNA cleavage is only one of the functions of some of these enzymes. They require the ribonuclease activity to perform some of their other functions. Extensive work on RNase A and angiogenin has been carried out earlier in our lab. This thesis comprises the work done on the eosinophil-associated RNases (EAR, ie. ECP and EDN) in relation to their dynamics and docking of ligands. The insights that have emerged into the catalytic mechanism of RNase A family of proteins based on the study of EAR and their ligand-bound complexes have been discussed. Comparisons with similar studies performed on angiogenin and RNase A are also presented. The material presented in the thesis is divided into eight chapters focusing on various aspects of the work. Chapter 1 constitutes introduction to the structural and functional aspects of the enzymes of the RNase A superfamily with emphasis on the EAR proteins The objectives of the thesis are also outlined in this chapter. Chapter 2 details the methods and materials that have contributed to the thesis work. Chapter 3 focuses on the water analysis technique developed to understand the role of water molecules, specifically those that interact for a longer time and hence forming atypical interactions with the biological system of interest. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss in detail the molecular dynamics studies carried out on EAR enzymes. Chapters 6 and 7 present the work on the dinucleotide-docked EAR complexes, insights into the catalytic mechanism of RNase A family of enzymes, and the role of water molecules in the formation of active-site...|$|R

Activated eosinophils are also a constant feature of VKC at both the circulation (cytofluorimetry) and tissue (tear cytology and conjunctival scrapings) levels. Moreover, allergen challenge induces a prolonged inflammatory reaction with a prevalent participation of eosinophils, lymphocytes and possibly basophils. Immunohistochemical studies of VKC biopsies show a multicellular inflammatory infiltrate with prevalence of activated eosinophils, mast cells and CD 4 lymphocytes in both epithelium and subepithelium. Mediator studies indicate that eosinophil products (<b>eosinophil</b> peroxidase, eosinophinal <b>cationic</b> <b>protein</b> and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin/eosinophil protein X) are increased in both serum and tears, where tryptase and interleukin (IL) - 5 are also detectable in higher amounts than in controls. On the basis of these findings, we postulate that VKC can represent a phenotypic model of up-regulation of the cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 5 q which through its products (IL- 3, IL- 4, IL- 5 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor) regulates Th 2 prevalence, IgE production as well as mast cell and eosinophil growth and function in VKC...|$|R
40|$|Background: Severe hypereosinophilic asthma (SEA) is the prodromal {{phase of}} EGPA, {{nevertheless}} {{there are no}} studies trying to recognize EGPA when the eosinophilic inflammation is still confined to upper and lower airway. Aims: To identify a panel of biological, clinical and functional markers to detect which severe asthmatic patient might be considered in a prodromal phase of EGPA. Methods: 30 patients with EGPA and 49 with SEA who do not fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of EGPA were enrolled. All patients underwent to a pulmonary and ENT visit. EGPA patients received rheumatologic assessment. Lung function and methacholine test were performed. Blood biomarkers were assessed: <b>eosinophils,</b> eosinophilic <b>cationic</b> <b>protein,</b> interleukins: IL 5 -IL 4, IGE, IgG 4, ANCA and sputum biomarkers: eosinophils, periostin, IL 8, GMCSF. The ACT test, short form (SF) - 36, SinoNasal Outcome Test and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire were also used. Results: No differences were observed between SEA and EGPA patients in lung function but SEA patients had a worst asthma control (p< 0. 001). Patients with SEA presented higher level of sputum eosinophils (p< 0. 002) while EGPA patients had had higher level of blood eosinophils in the past. The GMCSF was the only biomarker significantly increased in EGPA patients compared with SEA; in a post-hoc analysis, SEA patients with some features of diagnostic criteria of EGPA presented significantly higher level of sputum GMCSF (p< 0. 000). IgG 4 was abnormally increase in one SEA patient positive for ANCA but without systemic manifestation.   Conclusion: Sputum GMCSF {{might be a good}} biomarker of systemic eosinophilic disease; ANCA and IgG 4, considered together, may support the suspicious of EGPA in SEA...|$|R

40|$|As the {{carbohydrate}} lacto-N-fucopentaose III (CD 15 antigen or X-determinant) and its sialylated derivative sialyl-Lewis X {{are involved}} in the adhesion of cells rolling along the surface of endothelial cells, experiments were done to study the presence of these molecules on human eosinophils from patients with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Normal-density eosinophils from some patients showed higher levels of expression for lacto-N-fucopentaose III than light-density eosinophils. In contrast, sialyl-Lewis X was highly expressed by light-density eosinophils. Activation of normal-density eosinophils with calcium ionophore A 23187 resulted in increased expression of these molecules for a short time. Monoclonal antibodies to these carbohydrates stimulated eosinophils to secrete <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>protein,</b> but not eosinophil peroxidase, and acted as costimulatory signals for C 3 b-induced degranulation of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>protein.</b> It was suggested that CD 15 and sialyl-Lewis X might contribute to eosinophil-mediated tissue injury in patients with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|In {{childhood}} asthma, cough {{is a major}} symptom in some but not in others. There is {{only limited}} data on the frequency, severity and prevalence of cough in children with classical asthma. Studies have largely shown no relationship between cough frequency and cough receptor sensitivity with various asthma severity indices. However relating cough severity with asthma severity is limited by various methodological and sensitivity issues, and these are presented in this paper. Mild asthma exacerbations {{in a group of}} children with cough as a dominant symptom were characterised by an increase in cough severity (daytime cough scores) and eosinophilic inflammation but not neutrophilic inflammation. However neither cough receptor sensitivity or cough scores related to airway IL- 8, <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>protein,</b> myeloperoxidase or serum <b>eosinophil</b> <b>cationic</b> <b>protein,</b> and, asthma scores consistently related to cough score only early in the asthma exacerbation phase.

40|$|Thromboembolism is a {{prominent}} but poorly understood fea-ture of eosinophilic, or Loeffler's, endocarditis. Eosinophil (EO) specific granule proteins, in particular major basic pro-tein (MBP), accumulate on endocardial surfaces {{in the course}} of this disease. We hypothesized that these unusually <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> promote thrombosis by binding to the anionic endothe-lial protein thrombomodulin (TM) and impairing its anticoagu-lant activities. We find that MBP potently (IC 5, of 1 - 2 gM) inhibits the capacity of endothelial cell surface TM to generate the natural anticoagulant activated protein C (APC). MBP also inhibits APC generation by purified soluble rabbit TM with an IC 50 of 100 nM without altering its apparent Kd for thrombin or Km for protein C. This inhibition is reversed by polyanions such as chondroitin sulfate E and heparin. A TM polypeptide fragment comprising the extracellular domain that includes its naturally occurring anionic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moiety (TMD- 105) is strongly inhibited by MBP, whereas its counterpart lacking the GAG moiety (TMD- 75) is not. MBP also curtails the capacity ofTMD- 105 but notTMD- 75 to prolong the thrombin clotting time. Thus, EO <b>cationic</b> <b>proteins</b> potently inhibit anticoagulant activities of the glycosy-lated form of TM, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for thromboembolism in hypereosinophilic heart disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma is {{characterized}} by airway inflammation which can be reversible. AIM: Investigation the importance of eosinophils, ECP and IL- 5 in asthmatics versus patients with obstructive bronchitis and healthy subjects. We investigated the values {{before and after the}} treatment in asthmatics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 77 subjects divided in three groups as follows: 1) asthma patients; 2) patients with obstructive bronchitis and 3) control group of healthy subjects. In all the subjects there were determined: Total number of <b>eosinophils</b> (Eo), eosinophilic <b>cationic</b> <b>protein</b> (ECP), Interleukin 5 (IL- 5) and allergy tests. RESULTS: The total number of eosinophils was significantly increased in the group of asthma patients versus second and third group. We found that the presence of ECP demonstrate an ongoing inflammation, with or without clinical symptoms of asthma patients. There was significant difference between the values of ECP of asthma patients versus second and third group. Our results have shown that IL- 5 was significantly increased versus second group and controls (p < 0. 01). We also found the decrease of the values of inflammatory markers after the treatment with corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophils, ECP and IL- 5 could be useful markers for selecting allergic patients and could be the monitors of treatment effects...|$|R
40|$|Background. Animal {{studies have}} shown {{elevated}} surfactant production in response to lung injury. In human airways, the contribution of surfactant to the airway epithelial barrier and importance of eosinophilic inflammation is increasingly appreciated. The relationship between blood and sputum inflammatory indices of childhood asthma to surfactant levels is unknown. In this study we hypothesized {{that the degree of}} inflammation influences the level of dipalmitoyl phosphatidycholine (DPPC) in airways of children with asthma. Methods. Sixteen children with asthma (ages 5. 5 - 16 years) underwent venipuncture, skin prick test, spirometry, hypertonic saline challenge, and induced sputum during a nonacute phase. Sputum (sp) and blood (se) markers of inflammation (<b>eosinophils,</b> neutrophils, eosinophilic <b>cationic</b> <b>protein</b> [ECP]), were related to sputum DPPC levels and several markers of asthma severity (airway hyperresponsiveness, quality of life, FEV 1). Results. On multiple regression, sp-DPPC significantly correlated to sp-ECP (r = 0. 53, P = 0. 0048). Se-ECP, se-Eo, sp-eosinophils, sp-neutrophils, se-neutrophils, and inhaled steroids, dose did not significantly influence sp-DPPC. Exposure to smoke did not influence inflammatory markers. FEV 1 and quality of life data did not relate to any blood or sputum variable. A significant association between AHR and se-eosinophils, but not between AHR and se-ECP, sp-eosinophils, or sp-ECP was found. Conclusion. Elevated DPPC levels occur in the presence of chronic eosinophilic inflammation in airways of children with stable asthma. Whether this represents an inherent lung mechanism for epithelial protection remains to be elucidated...|$|R
