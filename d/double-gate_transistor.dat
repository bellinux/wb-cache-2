The thickness of the fin (measured in the direction from source to drain) determines the effective channel length of the device.

Based on the potential model, a new compact model for the subthreshold swing is formulated. It is shown that for the devices having very high short-channel effects (SCE), the effective subthreshold slope factor is mainly dictated by the potential close to the channel center rather than the surface.

40|$|Scaling of single-gate bulk MOSFET faces great {{challenges}} in the nanometer regime due to the severe short-channel effects that cause an exponential increase in the leakage power. Double-gate MOSFET technologies mitigate this limitation by providing an excellent control over a thin silicon body with two electrically coupled gates. FinFET is the most attractive choice among the <b>double-gate</b> <b>transistor</b> architectures because of the self alignment of the two gates and the similarity of the fabrication steps to the existing standard CMOS technology. In this paper, new sequential circuits based on independent-gate FinFETs are proposed to simultaneously reduce the power consumption and the circuit area.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the advantages of}} dual-gate polysilicon nanoribbon biosensors with a comprehensive evaluation of different measurement schemes for pH and protein sensing. In particular, we compare the detection of voltage and current changes when top- and bottom-gate bias is applied. Measurements of pH show that a large voltage shift of 491 mV pH- 1 is obtained in the subthreshold region when the top-gate is kept at a fixed potential and the bottom-gate is varied (voltage sweep). This is an improvement of 16 times over the 30 mV pH- 1 measured using a top-gate sweep with the bottom-gate at a fixed potential. A similar large voltage shift of 175 mV is obtained when the protein avidin is sensed using a bottom-gate sweep. This is an improvement of 20 times compared with the 8. 8 mV achieved from a top-gate sweep. Current measurements using bottom-gate sweeps do not deliver the same signal amplification as when using bottom-gate sweeps to measure voltage shifts. Thus, for detecting a small signal change on protein binding, it is advantageous to employ a <b>double-gate</b> <b>transistor</b> and to measure a voltage shift using a bottom-gate sweep. For top-gate sweeps, {{the use of a}} dual-gate transistor enables the current sensitivity to be enhanced by applying a negative bias to the bottom-gate to reduce the carrier concentration in the nanoribbon.

Janes Abstract: Vertical integration technology offers numerous advantages over conventional structures. <b>Double-gate</b> <b>transistors</b> {{can be easily}} fabricated for better device characteristics, and multiple device layers can be vertically stacked for better interconnect performance.

40|$|Using {{embedded}} SRAM as a path, FinFET {{may enter}} manufacturing at 32 nm. FinFET provides several advantages over the planar MOSFET structure [...] smaller size, larger current, smaller leakage, and less variation in threshold voltage. A compact model of multi-gate transistors will facilitate their adoption. BSIM-MG is a surface-potential based compact model of multi-gate MOSFETs fabricated on either SOI or bulk substrates. The effects of body doping are modeled. It can also model a <b>double-gate</b> <b>transistor</b> with independently biased {{front and back}} gates and asymmetric front and back gate work-functions and dielectric thicknesses. 1 Advantages of FinFET over Planar MOSFET What makes a transistor different from a resistor is that the gate controls the conduction channel, not the drain. The gate exerts its control through capacitive (electrostatic) coupling to the channel. When we shrink the MOSFET gate to a smaller size, the drain is pulled closer to the (middle of the) channel. That increases the capacitive coupling between the drain and the channel. When the transistor is too small, the drain has enough coupling to the channel that a current (leakage current) flows with only a drain voltage applied without a gate voltage. This is the problem facing the planar transistor structure, which has not changed for four decades. FinFET [1] allows the gate to control the channel from several sides (see Fig. 1), thus increasing the gate control and allows the gate length to be reduced further. Since the introduction of FinFET, this structure {{has been used to}} set new world record of smallest gate length several times at various research laboratories. The current record is 3 nm gate length. Clearly, FinFET can serve many technology nodes...|$|E

Hybrid integration of silicon and carbon nanotube electronics are demonstrated {{for the first time to}} show a viable direction for future electronics to extend technology reach for new scientific and engineering fields. The Super-self-aligned separately-gated <b>double-gate</b> field-effect <b>transistor</b> (FET), featuring strained silicon channel, thick source-drain region and buried-interconnected gate, have been made for both polarities n- and p-type using a novel approach that helps advance silicon CMOS technology to nanometer scale. All these features help alleviate the power consumption issues for future nanoscale CMOS transistor where performance degrades due to short channel effects and the loss of device threshold voltage control. A novel non-volatile memory device?xFET?is developed with several charge injection mechanisms to allow a variety of operational capabilities and provide significantly faster programming/erasing speed. Nanoseconds programming time has been achieved through hot electron injection. In a crossed nFET/pFET configuration, the new device features a four-terminal bipolar structure with a top floating gate used as the charge storage node. The silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology in the device development ensures excellent CMOS compatibility. With techniques borrowed from silicon ULSI technology, carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET) with either back-gate or self-aligned top-gate structure has been developed to improve device performance and integration. For back-gate CNFET, combined analysis of device?s transient and transfer characteristics in contrasting environment (in air or in vacuum) show distinct ambient effects on the device carrier transport properties.

40|$|As the CMOS {{technology}} {{continues to}} scale down, power dissipation and robustness to leakage and process variations are becoming major obstacles for circuit {{design in the}} nano-scale regime. Due to increased density of transistors in a die and higher frequencies of operation, the power consumption is reaching cooling capacity limits. On the other hand, due to increased leakage and process variations, the predictability and therefore the design yield is threatened. In this research, we address theses issues mostly at the circuit level of abstraction. For the power issue, {{we focus on the}} clock power because in current high-performance microprocessors significant fraction of the total chip power is dissipated on clock networks. In this regard, we have proposed novel energy recovery flip-flops that enable energy recovery from the clock network, resulting in significant energy savings. For the leakage tolerance issues, a leakage-tolerant design technique for high fan-in dynamic logic circuits is presented that exhibits considerable improvement in leakage immunity as compared to the standard domino circuits. To address the emerging issues of process variations, we have developed yield estimation and enhancement techniques, particularly for SRAM caches. The developed yield models are used for proposing a statistical design approach for designing SRAM arrays in nanoscale regimes. Finally, novel circuit design techniques for low power and high performance using non-classical CMOS devices such as double-gate MOSFETs are developed.

These MOSFETs are believed to be the smallest <b>double-gate</b> <b>transistors</b> ever fabricated. Excellent short-channel performance is observed in devices {{with a wide range of}} gate lengths (10 ~ 105 nm). The subthreshold slopes of the 10 nm gate length FinFETs are 125 mV/dec for n-FET and 101 mV/dec for p-FET, respectively. The DIBL’s are 71 mV/V for n-FET and 120 mV/V for p-FET, respectively. At 55 nm gate length, the subthreshold slopes are 64 mV/dec for n-FET and 68 mV/dec for p-FET, which is very close to the ideal MOSFET behavior (at room temperature). The DIBL’s are 11 mV/V for n-FET and 27 mV/V for p-FET, respectively. All measurements were performed at a supply voltage of 1. 2 V.
