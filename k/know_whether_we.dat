The country has gained the most splendid and decisive Victory that has ever graced the naval annals of England; but it has been dearly purchased.|$|E
500|$|Everton {{chairman}} David Marsh {{was disappointed}} {{with the introduction of}} football on Monday nights, as it disrupted [...] "the social life of British society and the fans." [...] Liverpool were also critical; when asked if the club would refuse to play games scheduled on that particular day, chief executive Peter Robinson replied: [...] "I cannot answer that because I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> would be contractually able to refuse." [...] Both Merseyside clubs offered its season ticket holders a refund for matches rescheduled for Monday nights, provided fans gave a seven-day notice. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said the prospect of playing on Sunday and Monday was a disadvantage to his and other clubs' chances in Europe. He called for an urgent discussion with other managers about the game's future: [...] "A deal was stampeded without consultation with the most important people in the game, the managers and the players whose livelihoods are at stake.... It's the most ludicrous and backward decision football has taken. We managers must seriously question its wisdom." ...|$|E
500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> will continue to support you after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes {{and now we have}} to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

2500|$|Jagger {{continues}} in the Rolling Stone interview {{when asked about the}} song's resonance thirty years on; [...] "I don't know if it [...] I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> should really play it. I was persuaded to put it [...] because it seemed to fit in, but I'm not sure if it really has any resonance for the present day. I don't really like it that much." [...] Despite this, the song has been performed on a majority of the Stones' tours since its introduction to their canon of work.|$|E
2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a [...] "zombie" [...] in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose some given {{data points}} each belong {{to one of}} two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a -dimensional vector (a list of [...] numbers), and we want to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> can {{separate}} such points with a -dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier; or equivalently, the perceptron of optimal stability.|$|E

2500|$|Shyamalan or Paramount/Nickelodeon did not {{immediately}} confirm the [...] "go-ahead" [...] or whether the plug will be pulled on the trilogy. While filming The Last Airbender, Shyamalan mapped out a rough draft for a second film that is [...] "darker" [...] and includes Azula, portrayed by Summer Bishil, as the main antagonist. In a July 2010 interview with New York Magazine, Shyamalan commented [...] "In {{the next few months}} we'll be able to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> have that opportunity or not" [...] when asked about the sequel. No such announcement was made and in a September 2010 interview when asked if he knew when the sequel will be made, he replied, [...] "I don't, {{because there are so many}} factors they take into account", adding, [...] "I guess it will get into an area where it becomes a discussion—like pros and cons." [...] In September 2015, Shyamalan confirmed to Metro UK that he may work on the sequel after completing his next thriller, which started shooting in November 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Khánh's {{quartet of}} delegates responded to Taylor by {{responding}} in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm {{and did not}} resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as [...] "the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated". When Taylor said that the moves detracted from Hương and Sửu's powers, the generals disagreed, and said that they supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the deposal of the HNC. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, saying at the meeting's end, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> will continue to support you after this ... ou people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess".|$|E
