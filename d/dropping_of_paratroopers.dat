25|$|The Battle of Dombås {{was fought}} between Norwegian Army {{infantry}} forces and German Fallschirmjäger paratroops in mid-April 1940. As {{part of their}} conquest of Norway south of Trondheim, and as a countermeasure against reported Allied landings in the Romsdal area of south western Norway, the Germans <b>dropped</b> a company <b>of</b> <b>paratroopers</b> near the vital railroad junction of Dombås on 14 April 1940. For the next five days, the German force blocked the Dovre Line railroad line between Oslo and Trondheim, {{as well as the}} main road between the two cities.|$|R
50|$|An {{essential}} survival skill, besides shooting bombs, {{is to be}} able {{to accurately}} destroy parachutes without killing the paratrooper before impact as well as <b>dropping</b> a stack <b>of</b> <b>paratroopers.</b> It is possible even after four paratroopers have landed that helicopters may drop more, and during their descent the landed paratroopers will delay their assault. An ability to shoot 'chutes and fatally <b>drop</b> <b>paratroopers</b> on top <b>of</b> ground forces is essential to extend game play in this situation. To maximize the ability to kill ground forces ready to assault the turret, avoid shooting helicopters as much as possible to maximize the number <b>of</b> falling <b>paratroopers</b> and the chances one could fall on a ground force.|$|R

5000|$|In 1941 {{he volunteered}} to {{organize}} the first group <b>of</b> <b>paratroopers</b> on skis. So in February 1942 then-Captain Gorham took his B Company, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment to Alta, Utah, where the United States was testing the concept <b>of</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>paratroopers</b> into the Alps behind the Germans and having them ski down to attack and harass their lines of communication. During this period Gorham is credited with having made the first parachute jump from over 10,000 feet. As was his leadership style, before Gorham would let anyone else jump he first made a solo jump to test whether it was safe. On that first jump, he was soon followed by LT Robert Ellis, SGT Roy Taylor and SGT W.P. Walsh. [...] The troopers trained hard, but falling on skis was different than falling when landing in a parachute jump. There were many legs and ankles injured. Despite much favorable press, the project was eventually abandoned and the troopers were spread out to the newly forming parachute units.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{trained for}} Operation Husky, {{the invasion of}} Sicily and entered combat {{on the night of}} 9 July 1943 by dropping paratroops near Gela.

The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation for this action. It moved to Sicily for Operation Avalanche, the invasion <b>of</b> Italy. It <b>dropped</b> <b>paratroopers</b> <b>of</b> 82d Airborne Division south of Salerno on the night of 13 September 1943 and flew a reinforcement mission the following night.|$|R
25|$|Although the Soviet Union did not {{contribute}} directly {{to the development of}} the RLAF, its actions in 1960-1961 had a great influence on RLAF development. In response to an appeal for help from Kong Le, the Soviet Union dedicated 44 transport aircraft to support of the Neutralist forces. Beginning in December 1960, the Soviets flew in military supplies, beginning with a battery of 105mm howitzers. The Russians flew about 1,000 sorties by March 1961 in support of the Neutralists even as they withdrew northward onto the Plaine des Jarres. The Soviet effort included some <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> Kong Le's <b>paratroopers,</b> as well as the provision of three Lisunov Li-2s to his air force. During the same time frame, the Vietnam People's Air Force's 919th Transport Regiment flew 184 resupply sorties from northern Vietnam into Sam Neua. The communist efforts sparked American efforts to beef up the RLAF.|$|R
25|$|The group <b>dropped</b> paratroops <b>of</b> the 82d Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment near Overasselt on 17 September 1944, {{losing one}} plane.

25|$|The Dutch {{were exposed}} to the first large scale {{airborne}} attack in history. During the invasion of the Netherlands, the Germans threw into battle almost their entire Luftlandekorps, an airborne assault army corps that consisted of one parachute division and one division of airlanding troops plus the necessary transport capacity. The existence of this formation had been carefully kept secret until then. Two simultaneous airborne operations were launched. German paratroopers landed at three airfields near The Hague, hoping to seize the Dutch government. From one of these airfields, they were driven out after the first wave of reinforcements, brought in by Ju-52s, was annihilated by anti-aircraft fire and fierce resistance by some remaining Dutch defenders. As a result, numerous crashed and burning aircraft blocked the runway, preventing further reinforcements from landing. This {{was one of the few}} occasions where an airfield captured by paratroops has been recaptured. The other two airfields were recaptured as well. Simultaneously, the Germans <b>dropped</b> small packets <b>of</b> <b>paratroopers</b> to seize the crucial bridges that led directly across the Netherlands and into the heart of the country. They opened the way for the 9th Panzer Division. Within a day, the Dutch position became hopeless. Nevertheless, Dutch forces inflicted high losses on German transportation aircraft. Moreover, 1200 German elite troops from the Luftlandekorps taken prisoner around The Hague, were shipped to England just before the capitulation of the Dutch armed forces.|$|R
