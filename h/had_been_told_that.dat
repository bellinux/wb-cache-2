5|$|Charles Darwin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail {{about the end of}} September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they were attacking {{in order to}} save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the load times and glitches in his review copy {{would not be in}} {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that there {{may well have been}} bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

25|$|Later in the year, Lenglen {{seemed to}} be on course for her seventh Wimbledon singles title. However, Lenglen unknowingly kept Queen Mary waiting in the Royal Box for her {{appearance}} in a preliminary match. Lenglen, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> her match would not start until much later, fainted upon being informed of her error, which was seen by aristocratic English attendees as an insult to the monarchy. Lenglen withdrew from the tournament, which would be her last appearance at the courts of Wimbledon.|$|E

During this time, the US was developing the Space Shuttle and Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the Shuttle was actually being constructed as an orbiting weapon system that could drop a nuclear bomb onto Moscow, bypassing all Soviet detection systems. Although the rumor was completely false, Brezhnev believed it anyway and ordered {{the development of a}} Soviet Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The United States Radium Corporation was a company, {{most notorious}} for its {{operations}} between the years 1917 to 1926 in Orange, New Jersey, in the United States {{that led to}} stronger worker protection laws. After initial success in developing a glow-in-the-dark radioactive paint, the company was subject to several lawsuits in the late 1920s {{in the wake of}} severe illnesses and deaths of workers (the Radium Girls) who had ingested radioactive material. The workers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the paint was harmless. During World War I and World War II, the company produced luminous watches and gauges for the United States Army for use by soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The {{island is}} {{relatively}} arid because {{it lies in}} the rain shadow of Kauai, and lacks the elevation needed to catch significant amounts of trade wind rainfall. Niihau therefore, depends for its rain on winter Kona storms, when more northerly weather systems intrude into the region. As such, the island is subject to long periods of drought. Historical droughts on Niihau have been recorded several times, one in 1792 by Captain James Cook's former junior officer, George Vancouver, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the people of Niihau had abandoned the island because of a severe drought and had moved to Kauai to escape famine.|$|E
25|$|Lee next {{answered}} {{a question about}} homosexuality at a Young PAP meeting in 2007. The questioner was Loretta Chen, an openly lesbian young PAP member and a bilingual theatre director in Singapore. She asked if the current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed {{in the next two}} decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors about homosexuality and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> it was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E
25|$|He {{has also}} been known {{to reach out to}} younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had {{previously}} met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.|$|E
