Methods: A self-reported questionnaire on physical activity and general health was mailed out to 1000 persons, aged 60 or over, who were covered by the medical insurance of the French National Education System. Among them, 535 answered it and sent it back. Two hundred and thirty-three persons (age 69. 7 +/- 7. 6, 65. 7 % women) said they would volunteer to participate in an <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> and 270 (age 71. 7 +/- 8. 8, 62. 2 % women) did not.

Previous {{studies suggest that}} intravenous infusion of adenosine, coupled with thallium- 201 scintigraphy, may have specific value as a noninvasive means of evaluating coronary artery disease. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the diagnostic value of adenosine thallium testing with that of standard exercise thallium testing. One hundred subjects were studied with exercise thallium imaging and thallium imaging after adenosine infusion, including 47 with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and 53 control subjects. The overall sensitivity of the thallium procedures was 81 % for the <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> and 83 % for the adenosine study (p = NS); the specificity was 74 % for the <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> and 75 % for the adenosine study (p = NS). The diagnostic accuracy of the <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> was 77 % and that of the adenosine study was 79 %. Ninety-four percent of subjects had an adverse effect due to the adenosine infusion; however, most of these effects were mild and well tolerated. All adverse effects abated within 30 to 45 s of the termination of the study, consistent with the very brief half-life of the agent. Thus, thallium- 201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine has a diagnostic value similar to that of exercise thallium testing for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium testing may be particularly useful in evaluating patients unable to perform treadmill exercise testing...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Physical {{exercise}} has {{a positive}} effect on cognitive functioning, mobility and activities of daily living in people with dementia (Forbes & al., 2013; Pitkälä & al., 2013). Most <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> employ motivational strategies to support adherence to the exercise intervention but it is unclear how effective these strategies are. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to establish the range and effect of motivational strategies used in <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> for people with MCI and dementia. Method: Articles were identified from the following databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Web of Science. Independently, a minimum of two authors assessed relevant articles based on in- and exclusion criteria. Studies using quantitative as well as qualitative methods {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} motivational strategies were included. Results: The review analysed 28 articles that were identified to report the use of motivational strategies in <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> and partly evaluated their effectiveness. Employed strategies included supervision of sessions by instructors, caregivers or students, group settings, goal setting, exercise diaries, tailoring of programme, telephone calls and music. The effectiveness of strategies was only evaluated in a minority of the studies (use of group setting, goal setting and music). Discussion: Adherence to exercise intervention and continuation of the physical activity after completion of the intervention is an ongoing issue in exercise research. Given the limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of motivational strategies, tried and new strategies should be evaluated for people with MCI and dementia to ensure optimal support of physical exercise in this group...|$|R

40|$|Exercise {{is one of}} the few {{treatments}} that provide significant improvements in chronic low back pain (CLBP). We developed an innovative exercise device for abdominal trunk muscles. This device can be used in a sitting or standing position and contains a built-in system to measure abdominal trunk muscle strength. We examined whether subjects can adequately use the device to perform the exercises and measure their abdominal trunk muscle strength. We collected data on the body height, body weight, body mass index, and girth of 30 healthy male volunteers, and measured their grip power and trunk extensor muscle strength using a dynamometer. The volunteers performed a sit-up test as an indicator of trunk flexor muscle strength, and we measured their abdominal muscle strength using the device. We then evaluated the correlations between abdominal trunk muscle strength and anthropometric parameters as well as the strength of other muscles. In subsequent tests, 5 of the 30 subjects participated in two positron emission tomography (PET) series consisting of examinations after a resting period (control study) and during exercise (<b>exercise</b> <b>study).</b> For the <b>exercise</b> <b>study,</b> the subjects performed 2 sets of exercises for 20 minutes using the device before and after an injection of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). PET-computed tomography images were obtained 60 minutes after FDG injection in each study. We compared the skeletal muscle metabolism of the participants in both studies using the standardized uptake value. The muscle strength measured by the device and the 30 -second sit-up frequency were correlated. FDG accumulation within the diaphragm and abdominal rectus muscles was significantly higher in the <b>exercise</b> <b>study.</b> Our innovative exercise device facilitates a coordinated contraction of the abdominal trunk muscles at the anterior aspect and the roof of the core, and enables subjects to measure the strength of these muscles...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Supplement use among athletes is widespread, including non-traditional and biological compounds. Despite increasing research, a comprehensive and critical review on polyphenol supplementation and exercise is still lacking. This review is relevant for researchers {{directly involved in}} the topic, as well as those with a broad interest in athletic performance enhancement and sports nutrition. The purpose of this review is to present background information on groups of polyphenols and their derivatives because their differing chemical structures influence mechanisms of action; to discuss the potential of plant, fruit and vegetable-based biological supplements, high in polyphenol content, to affect exercise performance and biomarkers of oxidative stress and exercise-induced muscle damage; and to critically discuss the <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> and biomarkers used. Subjects in the studies reviewed were either sedentary, healthy individuals, or active, recrea-tionally trained or well-trained athletes. Polyphenol sup-plementation in <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> included mainly extracts (multicomponent or purified), juices, infusions or an increased intake of polyphenol-rich foods. This review includes details of supplement doses and exercise test protocols. Many studies considered only the performance or one or two selected biomarkers of antioxidant capacity instead of a comprehensive choice of biomarkers to assess damage to lipids or proteins. Evidence is insufficient to make recommendations for or against the use of polyphe-nol supplementation (neither specific polyphenols nor specific doses) for either recreational, competitive or elite athletes. Polyphenols have multiple biological effects, and future <b>exercise</b> <b>studies</b> must be designed appropriately and specifically to determine physiological interactions between exercise and the selected supplement, rather than considering performance alone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the short term}} effects of tennis training on lipid metabolism {{and to find out}} if a typical tennis training programme has positive longitudinal effects on cardiovascular risk factors in recreational players. METHODS: The experimental design consisted of an <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> and a subsequent longitudinal study. In the <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> the short term metabolic effects of a two hour technically orientated tennis training (TT) session and a running intensive tennis training (RIT) session were investigated in 16 recreational tennis players (eight men: 46 (SD 7) years, 177 (6) cm, 81 (10) kg; and eight women: 44 (5) years, 165 (5) cm, 64 (6) kg). In the longitudinal study the long term effects of a six week RIT programme in 22 players (11 men and 11 women) of similar characteristics were compared with those in 16 control subjects (eight men and eight women). The results of the <b>exercise</b> <b>study</b> (higher lipolytic activity and cardiopulmonary demand, as well as acceptance by the players) led to the RIT method being chosen for all training sessions in the longitudinal study. RESULTS: In RIT, significantly higher values for heart rate (148 (SD 10) v 124 (11) beats/minute) and lactate (2. 8 (1. 1) v 1. 5 (0. 6) mmol/l), significantly higher post exercise concentrations of serum glycerol (0. 37 (0. 15) v 0. 29 (0. 14) mmol/l) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 31 (0. 55) v 1. 20 (0. 50) mmol/l) and a higher acceptance than in TT (15 of the 16 players preferred RIT) were found. During the six week tennis training programme the changes in body weight (- 1. 41 (1. 56) v 0. 00 (1. 50) kg) and anaerobic threshold (1. 04 (0. 84) v - 0. 08 (0. 92) km/h) were significantly different between the training and control group. In the training group several parameters of the lipoprotein profile tended to change in an antiatherosclerotic direction. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that typical regular tennis training influences cardiovascular risk factors in a positive manner and can be suggested as an attractive alternative to other current health orientated sports programmes. A more frequent use of running intensive exercises during tennis training is recommended...|$|E
