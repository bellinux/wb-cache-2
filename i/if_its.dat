5|$|For each {{component}} in the reverse topological order, <b>if</b> <b>its</b> variables do not already have truth assignments, set all the literals in the component to be true. This also causes all of the literals in the complementary component to be set to false.|$|E

5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. <b>If</b> <b>its</b> density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of evolution, {{as they are}} presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve <b>if</b> <b>its</b> incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even <b>if</b> <b>its</b> precision was mostly due to chance. Before this point, the Weather Bureau had a policy against issuing tornado warnings, mainly due to fear of panic by the public, and subsequent complacency if forecasts {{turned out to be}} false alarms.|$|E

5|$|A {{community}} may incorporate as a town <b>if</b> <b>its</b> population {{is greater than}} 2,500 and {{the outcome of a}} vote involving affected residents was that greater than 50% voted in favour of the proposed incorporation. British Columbia has 14 towns. The former Town of Fort Nelson amalgamated with the Northern Rockies Regional District on February 6, 2009 to form the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality.|$|E
5|$|A town is a {{classification}} of municipalities used in British Columbia. British Columbia's Lieutenant Governor in Council may incorporate a {{community as a}} town by letters patent, under {{the recommendation of the}} Minister of Communities, Sport and Cultural Development, <b>if</b> <b>its</b> population is greater than 2,500 but not greater than 5,000 and the outcome of a vote involving affected residents was that greater than 50% voted in favour of the proposed incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism <b>if</b> <b>its</b> subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} the {{environment}} has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, <b>if</b> <b>its</b> own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, especially <b>if</b> <b>its</b> feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration <b>if</b> <b>its</b> ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E

5|$|Junior doctors {{usually have}} these {{acquired}} memories erased {{as soon as}} possible. However, as a doctor rises up through the hospital hierarchy, and <b>if</b> <b>its</b> mind proves to be sufficiently stable, it may find itself the permanent recipient {{of one or more}} tapes. Diagnosticians, the medical elite of Sector General, can have as many as ten different tapes active at one time, as they may have to supervise treatment of many species at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Models predict that, <b>if</b> <b>its</b> non-Keplerian orbit {{could be}} {{averaged}} to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0.28, then tidal heating {{would play a}} significant role in the planet's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten. Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it receives from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.|$|E
5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one {{of their}} own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil <b>if</b> <b>its</b> power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E

5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country. It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago's granitic high islands. Although it may be abundant, {{little is known about}} its biology. <b>If</b> <b>its</b> habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} to see <b>if</b> <b>its</b> agents could destroy the dock gates. They {{decided that the}} mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E
5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible if and only <b>if</b> <b>its</b> determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) {{of the image of}} the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.|$|E
