But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with Intelligent Design [...] uppercase ‘I’ and ‘D’ [...] a movement widely seen as anti-evolutionist.” He indicated that teleological arguments, such as the apparent fine tuning of the universe, can count as evidence, but not proof, for the existence of God.

2500|$|At age 15, after {{a series}} of outbursts in which Numan would [...] "smash things up, scream and shout, get in people's faces and break stuff", he was {{prescribed}} antidepressants and anxiolytics. Numan's wife later suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed, and identified himself as having AS, though he has not professionally been diagnosed with it. In a 2001 interview, he said, [...] "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just recently I actually found out that I'd got a mild form of Asperger's syndrome which basically means <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> interacting with people.

2500|$|After his retirement, O'Neal {{was hired}} by Turner Sports as an NBA analyst. When asked {{whether it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to criticize Bryant, he answered [...] "I have the ability and the backing to give fair criticism. The only time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with people giving criticism is when they haven't walked that walk. I've walked many walks in my 19-year career, so I think any criticism that I give should be fair." [...] During the 2011 NBA lockout, Bryant discussed his problems with O'Neal with a radio station in Italy, saying [...] "I like players who workout. I used to do that 6–7 hours per day.

5000|$|Fellow Mises Institute Senior Fellow Roderick T. Long {{states that}} Hoppe's a priori {{formulation}} of libertarianism denies the fundamental principle of Misesean praxeology.

[...] Another critic argues that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we [...] "have to regard moral values as something that must be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways". In other words, the theory relies [...] "on the existence of certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself {{be the result of}} 'value-free' reasoning." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Friday qualifying, Senna's nimble Lotus, {{well suited}} to the track, was easily quickest in both sessions, {{averaging}} 88.183 mph (141.917 km/h), nearly 1.2 seconds clear of Nigel Mansell's Williams. Still, changes to the course meant that Senna's time was over a second slower than Nelson Piquet's pole-winning time from the previous year.
