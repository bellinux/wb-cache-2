40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriatic lesions {{may involve}} nearly all {{sites of the}} body. Involvement of the genital skin is {{frequently}} classified as part of intertriginous psoriasis without special awareness and treatment for this presentation of the disease. Gaining knowledge about {{the frequency of the}} involvement of genital skin in these patients will improve the overall care for patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: We studied the prevalence of genital psoriasis in the Netherlands and epidemiological characteristics of this specific presentation of the disease. Furthermore, we studied the relation between flexural and genital psoriasis. PATIENTS/METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was sent to all 5300 members of the Dutch Psoriasis Society. Sociodemographic patient characteristics and disease-related data (such as localization of psoriatic lesions, involvement of the genitalia, age at onset of genital psoriasis and severity of genital psoriatic lesions) were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A response rate of 37 % was achieved. Almost 46 % of the responding patients with psoriasis, that is 16. 5 % of all potential responders (n = 5300), report genital involvement at some time during the course of their disease. The genitalia can become affected at any age. Many patients with current genital involvement (38 %) do not have the <b>flexural</b> <b>skin</b> affected. CONCLUSIONS: A large part of patients with psoriasis suffer from genital psoriasis, which was not associated with flexural involvement in at least one third of them. More attention to the genital region is required in the current standard treatment of both male and female psoriatic patients at any age...|$|E

5000|$|ISAAC Phase Two {{involved}} {{more intensive}} studies {{in a smaller}} number of selected centres. It began in 1998 and involved 30 centres in 22 countries with over 54,000 participating children. Phase Two was designed to investigate the relative importance of hypotheses of interest that arose from the Phase One results. ISAAC Phase Two enabled internationally standardised comparisons of disease and relevant risk factors using the modules developed by ISAAC collaborators (ISAAC Phase Two Modules Manual). These modules include the ISAAC core questionnaires, supplementary questionnaires, including questionnaires on disease management, child contact modules including examination for <b>flexural</b> dermatitis, <b>skin</b> prick tests for atopy, bronchial responsiveness to hypertonic saline, blood sampling and storage for serum IgE and genetic analyses, and a risk factor questionnaire module.ISAAC Phase Two aims were: ...|$|R
40|$|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by atypical elastic fibers that causes connective tissue abnormalities of the skin, eyes, and heart, among other organs. The disorder is rare, with a classic presentation of yellow-orange cobblestone-like papules on <b>flexural</b> areas, lax <b>skin,</b> ocular degeneration, and moribund vasculature in multiple organs. There is wide {{variability in the}} presentation of the affected organs [1]. We present two sisters with classic cutaneous findings of PXE with the additional unusual findings of numerous open comedones on the neck. To our knowledge, this is the first report of numerous open comedones in familial PXE...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Observational {{evidence}} suggests that infection with helminths protects against allergic disease and allergen skin sensitization. It is postulated that such effects are mediated by helminth-induced cytokine responses, in particular IL- 10. OBJECTIVE: We tested this hypothesis {{in a rural area}} of central Vietnam where hookworm infection is endemic. METHODS: One thousand five hundred and sixty-six schoolchildren aged 6 - 17 were randomly allocated to receive either anti-helminthic therapy or a placebo at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. We compared changes in the prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, allergen <b>skin</b> sensitization, <b>flexural</b> eczema on <b>skin</b> examination, questionnaire-reported allergic disease (wheeze and rhinitis symptoms), and immunological parameters (hookworm-induced IFN-gamma, IL- 5, IL- 10) between 0 and 12 months. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and eighty-seven children (95 % of these randomized) completed the study. The most common helminth infections were hookworm (65 %) and Ascaris lumbricoides (7 %). There was no effect of the therapy on the primary outcome, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (within-participant mean percent fall in peak flow from baseline after anti-helminthic treatment 2. 25 (SD 7. 3) vs. placebo 2. 19 (SD 7. 8, P= 0. 9), or on the prevalence of questionnaire-reported wheeze [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 35 - 3. 82, P= 0. 8] and rhinitis (adjusted OR= 1. 39, 0. 89 - 2. 15, P= 0. 1), or <b>flexural</b> dermatitis on <b>skin</b> examination (adjusted OR= 1. 15, 0. 39 - 3. 45, P= 0. 8). However, anti-helminthic therapy was associated with a significantly higher allergen skin sensitization risk (adjusted OR= 1. 31, 1. 02 - 1. 67, P= 0. 03). This effect was particularly strong for children infected with A. lumbricoides at baseline (adjusted OR= 4. 90, 1. 48 - 16. 19, P= 0. 009). Allergen skin sensitization was inversely related to hookworm-specific IL- 10 at baseline (adjusted OR= 0. 76, 0. 59 - 0. 99, P= 0. 04). No cytokine tested, including IL- 10, changed significantly after the anti-helminthic therapy compared with the placebo. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in worm burden over a 12 -month period in helminth-infected children increases the risk of allergen skin sensitization but not of clinical allergic disease. The effect on skin sensitization could not be fully explained by any of the immunological parameters tested. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Failure modes for {{sandwich}} {{beams of}} GFRP laminate skins and Nomex honeycomb core are investigated. Theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under 3 -point bending, is constructed, showing {{the dependence of}} failure mode and load on the ratio of skin thickness to span length and honeycomb relative density. Beam specimens are tested in 3 -point bending. The effect of honeycomb direction is also examined. The experimental data agree satisfactorily with the theoretical predictions. The results reveal {{the important role of}} core shear in a sandwich beam's bending behaviour and the need for a better understanding of indentation failure mechanism. High order sandwich beam theory (HOSBT) is implemented to extract useful information about the way that sandwich beams respond to localised loads under 3 -point bending. 'High-order' or localised effects relate to the non-linear patterns of the in-plane and vertical displacements fields of the core through its height resulting from the unequal deformations in the loaded and unloaded skins. The localised effects are examined experimentally by Surface Displacement Analysis of video images recorded during 3 -point bending tests. A new parameter based on the intrinsic material and geometric properties of a sandwich beam is introduced to characterise its susceptibility to localised effects. <b>Skin</b> <b>flexural</b> rigidity is shown to {{play a key role in}} determining the way that the top skin allows the external load to pass over the core. Furthermore, the contact stress distribution in the interface between the central roller and the top skin, and its importance to an indentation stress analysis, are investigated. To better model the failure in the core under the vicinity of localised loads, an Arcan- type test rig is used to test honeycomb cores under simultaneous compression and shear loading. The experimental measurements show a linear relationship between the out-of-plane compression and shear in honeycomb cores. This is used to derive a failure criterion for applied shear and compression, which is combined with the high order sandwich beam theory to predict failure caused by localised loads in sandwich beams made of GFRP laminate skins and Nomex honeycomb under 3 -point bending loading. Short beam tests with three different indenter's size are performed on appropriately prepared specimens. Experiments validate the theoretical approach and reveal the nature of pre- and post-failure behaviour of these sandwich beams. HOSBT is used as a compact computational tool to reconstruct failure mode maps for sandwich panels. Superposition of weight and stiffness contours on these failure maps provide carpet plots for design optimisation procedures...|$|R
