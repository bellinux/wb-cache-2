2500|$|Wilson unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to submit {{two of his}} compositions to Spector: [...] "Don't Worry Baby" [...] and [...] "Don't Hurt My Little Sister"; both written with the Ronettes in mind. It was reported that Wilson attended the session for [...] "River Deep – Mountain High" [...] (1966), where he sat [...] "transfixed" [...] and [...] "did not say a word". Harry Nilsson wrote [...] "This Could Be the Night" [...] (1966) {{as a tribute to}} Wilson, with production helmed by Spector. Modern Folk Quartet's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: [...] "we could see him in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> hours". Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining [...] "Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love… I love that message." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>For</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{the longest}} time, but which was {{for only a}} minute, Lightfoot and the big {{stranger}} stood still, glaring at each other. Then, snorting with rage, they lowered their heads and plunged together. Their antlers clashed with a noise that rang through the Green Forest, and both fell to their knees. There they pushed and struggled. Then they separated and backed away, to repeat the movement over again. It was a terrible fight. Everybody said so. If they had not known before, everybody knew now what those great antlers were for. Once the big stranger managed to reach Lightfoot's right shoulder {{with one of the}} sharp points of his antlers and made a long tear in Lightfoot's gray coat. It only made Lightfoot fight harder.|$|E
60|$|The yellow omnibus {{crawled up}} the {{northern}} roads <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> hours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps his assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps, also, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours crept long past the normal luncheon hour, {{and the long}} roads of the North London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like an infernal telescope. It {{was one of those}} journeys on which a man perpetually feels that now at last he must have {{come to the end of}} the universe, and then finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell Park. London died away in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then was unaccountably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels. It was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all just touching each other. But though the winter twilight was already threatening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat silent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on either side. By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen were nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as Valentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man's shoulder, and shouted to the driver to stop.|$|E

Every bullet finds a billet, according to a rather optimistic proverb, and you must admit that nowadays it is becoming increasingly difficult to find billets for a lot of young gentlemen who would have adorned, and probably thoroughly enjoyed, one of the old-time happy-go-lucky wars. But that is not exactly the burden of my complaint. The Balkan lands are especially interesting to us in these rapidly-moving days because they afford us the last remaining glimpse of a vanishing period of European history. When I was a child one of the earliest events of the outside world that forced itself coherently under my notice was a war in the Balkans; I remember a sunburnt, soldierly man putting little pin-flags in a war-map, red flags for the Turkish forces and yellow flags for the Russians. It seemed a magical region, with its mountain passes and frozen rivers and grim battlefields, its drifting snows, and prowling wolves; there was a great stretch of water that bore the sinister but engaging name of the Black Sea—nothing that I ever learned before or after in a geography lesson made the same impression on me as that strange-named inland sea, and I don’t think its magic has ever faded out of my imagination. And there was a battle called Plevna that went on and on with varying fortunes <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a great part of a lifetime; I remember the day of wrath and mourning when the little red flag had to be taken away from Plevna—like other maturer judges, I was backing the wrong horse, at any rate the losing horse. And now to-day we are putting little pin-flags again into maps of the Balkan region, and the passions are being turned loose once more in their playground.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Indiewire, critic Eric Kohn {{praised the}} film, saying [...] "The tone {{combines}} supreme deadpan delivery with a light, airy atmosphere that {{brings to mind}} Wes Anderson without the requisite pandering to hip expectations. There's nothing inherently cool or exciting about Max, and yet in his endless quest to find happiness in life--or in death--he's a supremely likable creation who endures multiple eras with the same passive attitude, and so emerges as an everyman for all times (including, during the quasi-science fiction finale, {{a version of the}} future that brings to mind Idiocracy)." [...] David Lewis of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film, saying in his review, [...] "American cinema has been churning out slacker movies <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> eons, so it's refreshing to report that Somebody Up There Likes Me enlivens the genre with a welcome breath of imagination, wit and charm." ...|$|R

It peaked at No. 3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and remained on the chart for 171 weeks. The album's closing track [...] "Somebody's Trying to Tell Me Something" [...] contains a note held by the group <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an eternity, which would continue into the album's runout groove, and emulated on the CD version for just over 40 seconds. This is an approximation of a locked groove, a gimmick used {{a number of times}} on vinyl albums (such as Diamond Dogs and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) where the ending sound would continue into the runout groove, with which the sound would continue on until the turntable arm was lifted off, or the automatic return on some turntables would kick in.

5000|$|According to Brown, [...] "Spector's {{production}} {{sounded as}} if it had been recorded in a school gynamsium—a vibrantly echoing mélange of chiming guitars, bells and exuberant, sunny harmonies". Barney Hoskyns described it as [...] "pure Wall-of-Sound Beach Boys, light years from the sound Terry Melcher was getting with the Byrds". Biographer Mark Ribowsky added that the [...] "folk rocker" [...] resembled a [...] "Wagnerian folk march with Wall of Sound".

Evolutionary theorists argue that such an "eye-for-an-eye " strategy makes sense, preventing future damage to one's self or kin (1, 2). Yet, in cases ranging from inconsiderate drivers to Nazi war criminals, even unrelated onlookers seem highly motivated to seek revenge, often in spite of personal cost. From the standpoint of self-interest, punishing those who violate the interests of strangers [...] a form of revenge called altruistic punishment [...] seems irrational.

40|$|Since {{the nineteenth}} century, more kinds of news outlets {{and ways of}} {{presenting}} news grew along with telegraphic, telephonic, and digital communications, leading journalists, policymakers, and critics to assume that more events became available than ever before. Attentive audiences say in surveys that they feel overloaded with information, and journalists tend to agree. Although news seems to have become more focused on events, several studies analyzing U. S. news content for the past {{century and a half}} show that journalists have been including fewer events within their coverage. In newspapers the events in stories declined over the twentieth century, and national newscasts decreased the share of event coverage since 1968 on television and since 1980 on public radio. Mainstream news websites continued the trend through the 2000 s. Instead of providing access to more of the "what", journalists moved from event-centered to meaning-centered news, still claiming to give a factual account in their stories, built on a foundation of American realism. As journalists concentrated on fewer and bigger events to compete, audiences turned away from mainstream news to look <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an abundance of events in digital media...|$|R
