A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and <b>fault</b> <b>gouge).</b> Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities.

The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E

The results of K-Ar radiogenic dating of <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> collected from six localities how a relatively wide range in age from 57. 5 million years ago (Ma) to 40. 3 Ma. <b>Fault</b> <b>gouges</b> are composed of newly formed minerals, including smectite, illite, zeolite, kaolinite, K-rich feldspar, apatite, and pyrite. The occurrence of abundant smectite and illite-lM d with lesser quantifies of zeolite suggests that the <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> experienced hydrothermal lteration at low temperatures. Smectite is probably unstable relative to other clay minerals, such as illite and zeolite. Considering that filiform mordenite is replacing the smectite, we suggest hat mordenite formed by re-crystallization i volving a solid-state transformation. Under high fluid/rock ratios, smectite seems to have formed in the early stage of alteration. In contrast, zeolite minerals and authigenic K-rich feldspar pro-gressively appeared with time as the fluid/rock ratio decreased with the changing chemistry of the hy-drothermal f uids. The composition of clay minerals in the gouge materials probably was controlled by the chemistry and the amount of circulating fluids derived from adjacent granitic rocks...|$|R

40|$|Ocean-floor carbonate- and clay-rich sediments form major inputs to {{subduction}} zones, {{especially at}} low-latitude convergent plate margins. Therefore, {{knowledge of their}} frictional behaviour is fundamental for understanding plate-boundary earthquakes. Here we report results of mechanical tests performed on simulated <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> prepared from ocean-floor carbonates and clays, cored during IODP drilling offshore Costa Rica. Clay-rich gouges show internal friction coefficients (that is, the slope of linearized shear stress versus normal stress data) of μint = 0. 44 − 0. 56, irrespective of temperature and pore-fluid pressure (Pf). By contrast, μint for the carbonate gouge strongly depends on temperature and pore-fluid pressure, with μint decreasing dramatically from 0. 84 at room temperature and Pf = 20 [*]MPa to 0. 27 at T = 140 [*]°C and Pf = 120 [*]MPa. This effect provides a fundamental mechanism of shear localization and earthquake generation in subduction zones, and makes carbonates likely nucleation sites for plate-boundary earthquakes.

50|$|At {{shallower}} depths, low {{pressures and}} temperatures can't cause the plastic and viscous behavior of solid rock necessary to move along low angle faults. It is considered that such characteristics may be achieved at significantly less extreme {{conditions in the}} clayey rocks or evaporites, which can then act as tectonic lubricants. The process, which significantly reduces the frictional resistance, is the fluid overpressure, which acts against the normal pressure, thereby reducing high lithostatic pressures and allowing fracturation, cataclasis and formation of tectonic breccia or <b>fault</b> <b>gouge</b> that could act as a decollement plane. Evaporites are also often related the decollement and thrust planes. Evaporites are strongly prone to shear deformation and therefore preferred planes of detachment.|$|E

30|$|Compared to a grain {{friction}} {{regime in}} which grain friction and comminution are the dominant deformation mechanisms, fluidization in a grain-inertia regime {{is expected to}} reduce the shear strength of faults.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} long-term CO 2 -brine-rock interactions on the frictional and transport properties of reservoir-derived <b>fault</b> <b>gouges,</b> prepared from both unexposed and CO 2 -exposed sandstone, and from aragonite-cemented fault rock of an active CO 2 -leaking conduit, obtained from a natural CO 2 field (Green River, Utah). Direct shear experiments (5 – 90 MPa effective normal stress; lab dry or wet; 20 – 100 °C) showed that the sandstone-derived gouges are characterised by virtually normal stress- and temperature-independent friction coefficients (μ ≈ 0. 5 – 0. 6). The data exhibited stable, velocity-strengthening behaviour moving towards near-neutral velocity-dependent behaviour with increasing effective normal stress. The carbonate-rich <b>fault</b> rock <b>gouges</b> exhibited higher friction coefficients (μ ≈ 0. 6 – 0. 7), with a transition from velocity-strengthening behaviour at room temperature (dry) to velocity-weakening behaviour at 100 °C (dry and wet), i. e. a transition from stable sliding to potentially unstable or seismogenic slip. Cross-fault permeability decreased up to 1. 5 orders with increasing displacement, showing slightly lower values for the carbonate-rich gouges. We infer that the mechanical behaviour of <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> derived from the sandstones studied will not be strongly influenced by long-term CO 2 -exposure, due to the low content of reactive minerals in the protolith. Significant changes in frictional strength or (micro) seismic potential of faults present in a CO 2 storage system are only expected when there is major carbonate precipitation in the fault damage zone due to rapid CO 2 leakage and degassing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{microstructural}} {{state and}} evolution of <b>fault</b> <b>gouge</b> {{has important implications for}} the mechanical behaviour, and hence the seismic slip potential of faults.

The aggregate grains are confined between two blocks of solid material and sheared under a given normal stress. During shear, the grains can fragment in a somewhat realistic way leading to an evolution of grain size, grain shape and overall tex-ture.

40|$|International audienceSpherical {{aggregates}} named clay-clast aggregates (CCAs) {{have been}} reported from recent investigations on retrieved clay-bearing <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> from shallow depth seismogenic faults and rotary shear experiments conducted on clay-bearing gouge at seismic slip rates. The formation of CCAs appears {{to be related to}} the shearing of a smectite-rich granular material that expands and becomes fluidized. We have conducted additional high-velocity rotary shear experiments and low-velocity double-shear experiments. We demonstrate that a critical temperature depending on dynamic pressure-temperature conditions is needed for the formation of CCAs. This temperature corresponds to the phase transition of pore water from liquid to vapor or to critical, which induced gouge pore fluid expansion and therefore a thermal pressurization of the fault. A detailed examination by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX-SEM) element mapping, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows strong similar characteristics of experimental and natural CCAs with a concentric well-organized fabric of the cortex and reveals that their development may result from the combination of electrostatic and capillary forces in a critical reactive medium during the dynamic slip weakening. Accordingly, the occurrence of CCAs in natural clay-rich <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> constitutes new unequivocal textural evidence for shallow depth thermal pressurization and consequently for past seismic faulting...|$|R
40|$|Strain {{localization}} during coseismic slip in <b>fault</b> <b>gouges</b> is {{a critical}} mechanical process that has implications for understanding frictional heating, the earthquake energy budget {{and the evolution of}} fault rock microstructure. To assess the nature of strain localization during shearing of calcite <b>fault</b> <b>gouges,</b> high-velocity (vmax= 1 m/s) rotary-shear experiments at normal stresses of 3 – 20 MPa were conducted under room-dry and wet conditions on synthetic calcite gouges containing dolomite gouge strain markers. When sheared at 1 m/s, the room-dry gouges showed a prolonged strengthening phase prior to dynamic weakening, whereas the wet gouges weakened nearly instantaneously. Microstructural analysis revealed that a thin (< 600 μm) high-strain layer and through-going principal slip surface (PSS) developed after several centimeters of slip in both dry and wet gouges, and that strain localization at 1 m/s occurred progressively and rapidly. The strain accommodated in the bulk gouge layer did not change significantly with increasing displacement indicating that, once formed, the high-strain layer and PSS accommodated most of the displacement. Thus, a substantial strain gradient is present in the gouge layer. In water-dampened gouges, localization likely occurs during and after dynamic weakening. Our results suggest that natural fault zones in limestone are more prone to rapid dynamic weakening if water is present in the granular slipping zones...|$|R
