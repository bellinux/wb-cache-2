25|$|The Sasanian kings were enlightened {{patrons of}} letters and philosophy. Khosrau I had the works of Plato and Aristotle {{translated}} into Pahlavi taught at Gundishapur, and even read them himself. During his reign, many historical annals were compiled, of which the sole survivor is the Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan (Deeds of Ardashir), a mixture of history and romance {{that served as the}} basis of the Iranian national epic, the Shahnameh. When Justinian <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> schools of Athens, seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at Khosrau's court. In time they grew homesick, and in his treaty of 533 with Justinian, the Sasanian king stipulated that the Greek sages should be allowed to return and be free from persecution.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
500|$|The {{assassination}} {{was reportedly}} {{carried out by}} Majid Jamali Fashi, who said in his televised confession (confirmed as genuine by Western intelligence officials) {{that he had been}} trained by Mossad in Tel Aviv. [...] "I woke up at 4 and made a call, the plan had not changed. I parked the motorbike near the tree," [...] Fashi said in his confession. Alimohammadi's wife said, [...] "I heard the explosion just when <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> door." [...] Mossad officials also reportedly concluded that the attacks were [...] "too dangerous" [...] for valuable intelligence operatives in Iran. The organisation has since reportedly instructed its Iranian spy network to concentrate on finding evidence of Iranian breaches of its nuclear-restriction agreements.|$|E

2500|$|I was now {{faced with}} an {{impossible}} situation. On the one hand, based on all available evidence, including his own earlier statements, this miserable excuse for an officer was guilty of flagrant desertion... Yet the German Army Manual states clearly that no German soldier can be tried unless he is clearly of sound mind and body, in a condition {{to hear the evidence}} against him. I looked up the passage again, to make sure, and consulted with my fellow judges...In my opinion and that of my fellow officers, Hermann Fegelein was in no condition to stand trial, or for that matter to even stand. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> proceedings...So I turned Fegelein over to [...] General Rattenhuber and his security squad.

2500|$|The Roman emperor Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> sanctuaries by decree about 30 years later, in 392 AD. The last {{remnants}} of the Mysteries were wiped out in 396 AD, when Arian Christians under Alaric, King of the Goths, destroyed and desecrated the old sacred sites. The closing of the Eleusinian Mysteries in the 4th century is reported by Eunapius, a historian and biographer of the Greek philosophers. Eunapius had been initiated by the last legitimate Hierophant, who had been commissioned by the emperor Julian to restore the Mysteries, which had by then fallen into decay. According to Eunapius, the very last Hierophant was a usurper, [...] "the man from Thespiae who held the rank of Father in the mysteries of Mithras." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Latin word sacerdos, [...] "priest," [...] is {{the same}} for both the {{grammatical}} genders. In Roman state religion, the priesthood of the Vestals was responsible for the continuance and security of Rome as embodied by the sacred fire that they could not allow to go out. The Vestals were a college of six sacerdotes (plural) devoted to Vesta, goddess of the hearth, both the focus of a private home (domus) and the state hearth that was the center of communal religion. Freed of the usual social obligations to marry and rear children, the Vestals took a vow of chastity in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were off-limits to the male colleges of priests. They retained their religious authority until the Christian emperor Gratian confiscated their revenues and his successor Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Vesta permanently.|$|E
