5000|$|From 2003 to 2014, China {{was a major}} {{currency}} manipulator. Economist C. Fred Bergsten, {{writing for}} the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that [...] "During this 'decade of manipulation,' China bought more than $300 billion annually to resist upward movement of its currency by artificially keeping the exchange rate of the dollar strong and the renminbi's exchange rate weak. China's competitive position was thus strengthened {{by as much as}} 30 to 40 percent {{at the peak of the}} <b>intervention.</b> <b>Currency</b> manipulation explained most of China's large trade surpluses, which reached a staggering 10 percent of its entire GDP in 2007." [...] During this period, China's currency manipulation was a point of conflict with the United States. Domestic leaders within the United States pressured the Obama administration to take a hard-line stance against China and compel them to raise the value of their currency, and legislation was introduced to the United States Congress calling on the President to impose tariffs on Chinese imports until China properly values its currency.|$|E

The paper finds empirical support for the strategy, in particular that dollar depreciation/appreciation results in rebalancing switches vis-a-vis the other major reserve currency, the euro; valuation changes in the minor currencies tend to result in switches among themselves. The finding implies that currency diversifications in response to exchange rate changes have thus far tended to be stabilizing for exchange markets; it also helps explain the relative stability of reserve currency shares.

Are these policies misguided and central bankers irrational? Or is evidence showing the effectiveness of sterilized intervention being overlooked?

We argue that this is an important methodological innovation since studies using time-series techniques are limited {{by the nature of the}} data: intense and sporadic bursts of intervention activity juxtaposed against exchange rates that change almost continuously on a daily basis. The event study framework used in standard finance studies, by contrast, is ideally suited to this circumstance. Focusing on daily US official intervention operations, we identify separate intervention “episodes” and analyze the subsequent effect on the exchange rate. Using the matched-sample mean test and the non-parametric sign test of the median, we find strong evidence that sterilized intervention systemically affects the exchange rate.

My dissertation will use three chapters to fill in this gap. Chapter 1 investigates the optimal <b>currency</b> <b>intervention</b> policy for a profitability targeting central bank using a two-period framework. It is shown that when foreign interest rate is zero, the optimal policy is nonintervention. If the interest rate is positive, a country may earn positive profits by incurring a trade surplus in the first period. However, there is an upper bound for the currency depreciation rate. A country will lose money under excessive devaluation. Chapter 2 further computes the specific annual and cumulative accounting profits and losses from 1994 when China began its <b>currency</b> <b>intervention.</b> It is shown that China 2 ̆ 7 s central bank initially made positive profits but since 2007 has lost a massive amount from the foreign exchange market.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the article is the {{theoretical}} aspects {{of the effectiveness of}} the sterilized <b>currency</b> <b>intervention</b> as a means to stabilize the fixed rate. Effectiveness of <b>currency</b> <b>intervention,</b> especially sterilized, is the subject of continuous controversy the resolution of which is searched for in more and more numerous statistical-econometrical empirical studies. In the face of contradictory and ambiguous study results as well as cursory empirical observation a particularly great importance should be attached to theoretical arguments that would provide a ground for interpretation and understanding of empirical observations. The main part of the article constitutes a critical overview of the theoretical views on the ways in which intervention influences the exchange rate. The conducted analysis leads to a conclusion that <b>currency</b> <b>interventions</b> directed to protect the rate level may in some cases be effective, but in others they may be ineffective. Such conclusion is perfectly consistent with the experience gathered. Contrary to the empirical analysis the theoretical perspective allows to look into the intervention mechanism and define the factors that may determine the effectiveness of intervention. ...|$|R
