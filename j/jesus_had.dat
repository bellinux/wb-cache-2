5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

25|$|The Gospel of Luke {{states that}} Jesus was first brought before Pontius Pilate for trial, since Pilate was the {{governor}} of Roman Judea, which encompassed Jerusalem where Jesus was arrested. Pilate initially handed him over to Antipas, in whose territory <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> been most active, but Antipas sent him back to Pilate's court.|$|E
25|$|The English school master George Robert Stowe Mead {{argued in}} 1903 that <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> existed, {{but that he}} had lived in 100 BCE. Mead based his {{argument}} on the Talmud, which pointed to Jesus being crucified c. 100 BCE. In Mead's view, this would mean that the Christian gospels are mythical. Tom Harpur has compared Mead's impact on myth theory to that of Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.|$|E
25|$|The {{last week}} in Jerusalem is the {{conclusion}} of the journey which <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> started in Galilee through Perea and Judea. Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.|$|E

25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E
25|$|As an Ursuline nun, Sister Esther Marie-Joseph Wheelwright de l'Enfant <b>Jésus,</b> <b>had</b> {{no contact}} with her family, and over time lost her {{connections}} with most people from her previous life. Those who had been instrumental in her joining the Ursulines, including the Marquise de Vaudreuil and Father Bigot, died in the succeeding years. In 1724, the Abenakis were attacked by an English force led by {{a friend of the}} Wheelwrights, Captain Johnson Harmon, and many of the people with whom Esther grew up were killed.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the week, Jesus has the Last Supper {{with his}} disciples, during which he institutes the Eucharist, and prepares them for his {{departure}} in the Farewell Discourse. After the supper, Jesus is betrayed with a kiss while he is in agony in the garden, and is arrested. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and Peter denies him three times, as <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> predicted during the Last Supper. The final week that begins with his entry into Jerusalem, concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday.|$|E

25|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea, the Roman emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD built {{a temple}} {{dedicated}} to the goddess Venus in order to bury the cave in which <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> been buried. The first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, ordered in about 325/326 that the temple {{be replaced by a}} church. During the building of the Church, Constantine's mother, Helena, is believed to have rediscovered the tomb (although there are some discrepancies among authors). Socrates Scholasticus (born c. 380), in his Ecclesiastical History, gives a full description of the discovery.|$|E
25|$|According to the Gospel of Nicodemus, Joseph {{testified to}} the Jewish elders, and {{specifically}} to chief priests Caiaphas and Annas that <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> risen from the dead and ascended to heaven and he indicated that others were raised from the dead at the resurrection of Christ (repeating –). He specifically identified the two sons of the high-priest Simeon (again in Luke 2:25–35). The elders Annas, Caiaphas, Nicodemus, and Joseph himself, along with Gamaliel under whom Paul of Tarsus studied, travelled to Arimathea to interview Simeon's sons Charinus and Lenthius.|$|E
25|$|Acts has two key {{structural}} principles. The {{first is}} the geographic movement from Jerusalem, centre of God's Covenantal people, the Jews, to Rome, centre of the Gentile world. This structure reaches back to the author's preceding work, the Gospel of Luke, and is signaled by parallel scenes such as Paul's utterance in Acts 19:21, which echoes Jesus's words 9:51 (Paul has Rome as his destination, as <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> Jerusalem). The second key element is the roles of Peter and Paul, the first representing the Jewish Christian church, the second the mission to the Gentiles.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Pope Pius XII {{declared}} the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli, {{based on the}} image on the Shroud of Turin had been offered to Pius XII who approved the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> been approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885 before {{the image on the}} Turin Shroud had been photographed.|$|E
25|$|The many sermons of Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) on the Virgin Mary {{reflect his}} belief in various Marian doctrines that were {{declared}} as dogmas centuries after his death. He reflected on the Assumption of Mary and referring to Psalm 132 argued that, just as <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> risen up to Heaven, so did Mary. He also supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. Given that Anthony {{was one of the}} best educated and articulate of the early Franciscans, he was treated as a Doctor of the Church by his order, even before the title was granted to him in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1841 {{with his}} Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics, Bauer argued that Jesus was {{primarily}} a literary figure, but left open {{the question of whether}} a historical Jesus existed at all. Then in his Criticism of the Pauline Epistles (1850–1852) and in A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin (1850–1851), Bauer argued that <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> not existed. Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time, as in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.|$|E

25|$|By the 5th century {{depictions of}} the Passion began to appear, perhaps {{reflecting}} {{a change in the}} theological focus of the early Church. The 6th century Rabbula Gospels include some of the earliest images of the crucifixion and resurrection. By the 6th century the bearded depiction of <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> become standard, both in the East and the West. These depictions with reddish brown hair parted in the middle and with almond shaped eyes showed consistency for several centuries. At this time various legends were developed to attempt to validate the styles of depiction, e.g. the image of Edessa and later the Veil of Veronica.|$|E
25|$|Both complementarians and egalitarians see Jesus as {{treating}} {{women with}} compassion, grace and dignity. The gospels of the New Testament, especially Luke, mention Jesus speaking to or helping women publicly and openly. Martha's sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet being taught, a privilege reserved {{for men in}} Judaism. <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> female followers who were his sponsors, and he stopped to express concern for the women of Jerusalem {{on his way to}} be crucified. Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to be the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, new {{reports of}} miraculous images of <b>Jesus</b> <b>had</b> {{appeared}} and continue to receive significant attention, e.g. Secondo Pia's 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin, {{one of the most controversial}} artifacts in history, which during its May 2010 exposition it was visited by over 2 million people. Another 20th century depiction of Jesus, namely the Divine Mercy image based on Faustina Kowalska's reported vision has over 100 million followers. The first cinematic portrayal of Jesus was in the 1897 film La Passion du Christ produced in Paris, which lasted 5 minutes. Thereafter cinematic portrayals have continued to show Jesus with a beard in the standard western depiction that resembles traditional images.|$|E
