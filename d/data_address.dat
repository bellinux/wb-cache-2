50|$|In the XMEGA variant, {{the working}} {{register}} file is not mapped into the <b>data</b> <b>address</b> space; as such, {{it is not}} possible to treat any of the XMEGA's working registers as though they were SRAM. Instead, the I/O registers are mapped into the <b>data</b> <b>address</b> space starting at the very beginning of the address space. Additionally, the amount of <b>data</b> <b>address</b> space dedicated to I/O registers has grown substantially to 4096 bytes (000016-0FFF16). As with previous generations, however, the fast I/O manipulation instructions can only reach the first 64 I/O register locations (the first 32 locations for bitwise instructions). Following the I/O registers, the XMEGA series sets aside a 4096 byte range of the <b>data</b> <b>address</b> space, which can be used optionally for mapping the internal EEPROM to the <b>data</b> <b>address</b> space (100016-1FFF16). The actual SRAM is located after these ranges, starting at 200016.|$|E

40|$|Semantic {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to facilitate interoperability in different fields of study. Current literature, however, shows that the semantic approach has not been used to facilitate the interoperability of addresses across domains. Addresses are important reference data used to identify locations and /or delivery points. Interoperability of <b>address</b> <b>data</b> across <b>address</b> or application domains is important because it facilitates the sharing of <b>address</b> <b>data,</b> <b>addressing</b> software and tools which can be used across domains. The aim of this research study has been to evaluate how a semantic (ontologies) approach could be used to facilitate <b>address</b> <b>data</b> interoperability and what the challenges and benefits of the semantic approach are. To realize the hypothesis and answer the research problems, a multi-tier hierarchy of ontology architecture was designed to integrate (across domain) <b>address</b> <b>data</b> with different levels of granularities. Four-tier hierarchy of ontologies was argued to be the optimal architecture for <b>address</b> <b>data</b> interoperability. At the top of the hierarchy was Foundation-Tier that includes vocabularies for location-related information and semantic language rules and concepts. The second tier has address reference ontology (called Base Address Ontology) that was developed to facilitate interoperability across the address domains. Developing optimal address reference ontology was one of the major goals of the research. Different domain ontologies were developed at the third tier of the hierarchy. Domain ontologies extend the vocabulary of the BAO (address reference ontology) with domain specific concepts. At the bottom of the hierarchy are application ontologies that are designed for specific purpose within an address domain or domains. Multiple scenarios of <b>address</b> <b>data</b> usage were considered to answer the research questions from different perspectives. Two interoperable address systems were developed to demonstrate the proof of concepts for the semantic approach. These interoperable environments were created using the UKdata+UPUdata ontology and UKpostal ontology, which illustrate different use cases of ontologies that facilitate interoperability. Ontology reason, inference, and SPARQL query tools were used to share, exchange, and process <b>address</b> <b>data</b> across <b>address</b> domains. Ontology inferences were done to exchange <b>address</b> <b>data</b> attributes between the UK administrative <b>address</b> <b>data</b> and UK postal service <b>address</b> <b>data</b> systems in the UKdata+UPUdata ontology. SPARQL queries were, furthermore, run to extract and process information from different perspective of an address domain and from combined perspectives of two (UK administrative and UK postal) address domains. The second interoperable system (UKpostal ontology) illustrated the use of ontology inference tools to share <b>address</b> <b>data</b> between two <b>address</b> <b>data</b> systems that provide different perspectives of a domain.
