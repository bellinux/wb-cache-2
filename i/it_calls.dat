The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. <b>It</b> <b>calls</b> constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E

5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. <b>It</b> <b>calls</b> throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.|$|E
5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. <b>It</b> <b>calls</b> into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E

The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. <b>It</b> <b>calls</b> Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
