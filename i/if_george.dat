25|$|Retired {{police detective}} Steve Hodel argues {{in his book}} The Black Dahlia Avenger that his father, George Hill Hodel, Jr., was the Black Dahlia killer whose victims include Elizabeth Short. The book led {{to the release of}} {{previously}} suppressed files and wire recordings by the Los Angeles district attorney's office of his father which showed that he was a prime suspect in Short's murder. District Attorney Steve Kaye subsequently wrote a letter which is published in the revised edition stating that <b>if</b> <b>George</b> Hodel were still alive he would be prosecuted for the crimes. In a follow-up book, Hodel argued a circumstantial case that his father was also the Zodiac Killer based upon a police sketch, the similarity of the style of the Zodiac letters to the Black Dahlia Avenger letters and questioned document examination.|$|E
500|$|Adamle was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Buckeyes again in 1947, but decided to leave school and join the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Adamle had been selected with the 105th pick in the 1947 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, and he told Cleveland head coach Paul Brown, who coached Ohio State's varsity team between 1941 and 1943, that he would join the Bears if the Browns did not sign him. [...] "I would be a pretty sick fellow today, knowing what I do about Tony, <b>if</b> <b>George</b> Halas had gotten him," [...] Brown said before the season began.|$|E

500|$|The storyline used {{elements}} of suspense, {{created by the}} use of [...] "shared secrets" [...] between Peggy and her daughter-in-law Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or <b>if</b> <b>George</b> would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: [...] "such devises [...] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [...] that she [...] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'." [...] Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.|$|E
500|$|In his {{preview of}} Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed Is This What You Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album {{releases}} and praised [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as, variously, a [...] "get-off-your-ass rocker" [...] and [...] "dynamite". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered {{it to be}} [...] "a knockout version". Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] "would've {{been one of the}} best songs on [...] <b>if</b> <b>George</b> had kept it for himself", while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as [...] "sensational". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song [...] "a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker". In his liner notes to the compilation, Andy Davis, formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine, highlights [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as [...] "the greatest record The Beatles never made".|$|E
500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because <b>if</b> <b>George</b> [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E

500|$|Asquith {{attempted}} {{to curtail the}} power of the Lords through constitutional reforms, which were again blocked by the Upper House. A constitutional conference on the reforms broke down in November 1910 after 21 meetings. Asquith and Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, asked George to grant a dissolution, leading to a second general election, and to promise to create sufficient Liberal peers if the Lords blocked the legislation again. <b>If</b> <b>George</b> refused, the Liberal government would otherwise resign, which would have given the appearance that the monarch was taking sides– with [...] "the peers against the people"– in party politics. The King's two private secretaries, Lords Knollys and Stamfordham, gave George conflicting advice. Knollys, who was Liberal, advised George to accept the Cabinet's demands, while Stamfordham, who was Unionist, advised George to accept the resignation. Like his father, George reluctantly agreed to the dissolution and creation of peers, although he felt his ministers had taken advantage of his inexperience to browbeat him. After the December 1910 election, the Lords let the bill pass on hearing of the threat to swamp the house with new peers. The subsequent Parliament Act 1911 permanently removed– with a few exceptions– {{the power of the}} Lords to veto bills. The King later came to feel that Knollys had withheld information from him about the willingness of the opposition to form a government if the Liberals had resigned.|$|E

However in 2013, Morrissey criticised Obama for the White House Turkey Pardon ceremony calling it [...] "embarrassingly stupid".

He was also an atheist and an anti-war activist. He was one of numerous notable public figures, including the linguist Noam Chomsky and the actress Susan Sarandon, who signed the [...] "Not in Our Name" [...] declaration opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Julian Fellowes believes that Altman's anti-war and anti-Bush stance cost him the Best Director Oscar for Gosford Park.|$|E
50|$|Further, Thomas {{introduced}} the important {{concept of the}} 'definition of the situation', which was later {{referred to as the}} Thomas theorem. An example of this major contribution is if James is convinced that George hates him then he will act towards George {{in a way that will}} sour their relationship, regardless <b>if</b> <b>George's</b> hatred is real or imagined. What really counts is the way the actor defines the meaning of the symbol, not what the symbol may mean to the sociologist investigating the actor's actions.|$|R

[...] Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, [...] "I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." [...] She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred. During redirect examination, Baez asked Holloway <b>if</b> <b>George</b> Anthony had told her that Caylee was dead while stating publicly that she was missing, to which she replied yes.|$|E
