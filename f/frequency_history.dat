40|$|Effects of {{stimulation}} <b>frequency</b> <b>history</b> on length-force characteristics were determined for rat medial gastrocnemius muscle (GM). The peripheral nerve was stimulated supramaximally {{according to two}} stimulation protocols. First, {{a complete set of}} length-force data were obtained by stimulating the nerve with a decreasing stimulation frequency (DSF) staircase composed of five successive pulse trains (200 ms each) of 100 -, 50 -, 40 -, 30 - and 15 -Hz stimulation. Then length-force data were obtained using constant stimulation frequency (CSF; during the isometric contraction inter-stimulus interval was constant). The acquisition order of a complete set of length-force data was: first 15 -Hz, then 30 -, 40 -, 50 - and finally 100 -Hz stimulation. For all DSF conditions, bath optimum muscle length as well as active slack length were shifted significantly (P< 0. 05) to lower muscle length with respect to CSF. Muscle length range between active slack and optimum length for all DSF conditions was increased significantly with respect to CSF. DSF thus caused a marked shift of the length-force relationship to lower muscle length compared to the CSF-dependent length-force relationship. As a result of this shift, muscle force enhancement (potentiation) was non-linearly related to muscle length; force enhancement decreased exponentially with increasing muscle length. In addition, DSF-dependent length-force characteristics are not scaled and shifted versions of those for CSF. Possible factors affecting these length-force characteristics are higher intracellular calcium concentration, myosin light chain phosphorylation, fatigue during sustained contractions, interaction between aponeurosis and fibre length, distribution of fibre mean sarcomere length with respect to muscle length, and muscle length changes during unfused tetanic contractions. It is concluded that length-force characteristics of rat GM are dependent on both short-term stimulation <b>frequency</b> <b>history</b> as well as stimulation frequency per se...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{account for}} the {{preservation}} of the English inseparable prefix be- beyond early Middle English, and for its productive capacity, by making use of the construction grammar model (CxG) as mainly developed by Goldberg (1995, 2006), and based on research on constructions by, for instance, Lakoff (1987), Fillmore, Kay, O’Connor (1988), and Michaelis (1994). We discuss be-’s <b>frequency</b> <b>history</b> in detail and contrast it with another prefix, to-, whose <b>frequency</b> <b>history</b> is taken to be representative of inseparable prefixes other than be-. Next, we describe the Construction Grammar approach to verb prefixes, and describe the two types of prefix constructions that are relevant for our study, namely, predicative and non-predicative prefix constructions (Blom 2004). On the whole, predicative prefix constructions can be defined as those constructions in which the prefix functions as a secondary predicate denoting the result of the action of the verb (the primary predicate). Non-predicative prefixes refer to another set of prefixes, among which those at play here, which license a direct object and have a function similar to that of a preposition in a prepositional phrase. It will be seen that the differences in life span and development of the various prefixes depends on the distinct syntactico-semantic properties of each of these prefix constructions. While predicative prefixes could easily be replaced by functionally and semantically equivalent phrasal particles during the transitory period when English shifted from an OV-language to aVO-language, the salient syntactico-semantic makeup of the non-predicative construction marked by the prefix be- largely prevented a similar replacement. It is precisely this salient non-predicative construction that will serve as the prototype for various extensions. In three of the resulting new constructions, be- assumes a more grammatical function. It will be shown that the highly salient constructional properties of these major grammaticalized uses together with the spatial prototype on which they are based, and their high degree of type entrenchment are major factors in the conservation of the prefix be-. status: publishe...|$|E
