The first study examined the use of Boolean operators by French university students; In the second study, elaborated to evaluate the impact of information search expertise on this use, Boolean operators are explicitly presented and participants were explicitly invited to use them. We assumed that university students would not frequently use the operators in searching, and that even if they were explicitly invited to make use of them. Results obtained with the first study based on transaction logs analyses confirmed that French university students did not frequently use Boolean operators. The impact of information search expertise, analysed in the second study, compared three levels of expertise: Novice (university students), intermediate (future professional librarians), and expert (professional librarians). Results showed that, even if the three groups were invited to use Boolean operators, this use increased significantly with the level of information search expertise. University students, if they manage procedural functions of connectives in natural language, do not always manage the whole set of procedural functions carried by such connectives when used <b>in</b> the <b>documentary</b> <b>language.</b> So, the relevance of presenting explicit Boolean operators in the OPACs when users are ‘non-librarians' is questioned...|$|R

We {{describe}} a multimedia, multilingual and multimodal research system (CIMWOS) supporting content-based indexing, archiving, retrieval and on-demand delivery of audiovisual content. CIMWOS (Combined IMage and WOrd Spotting) incorporates an extensive set of multimedia technologies by seamless integration of three major components – speech, text and image proc-essing – producing a rich collection of XML metadata annotations following the MPEG- 7 standard. These XML annotations are further merged and {{loaded into the}} CIMWOS Multimedia Database. Additionally, they can be dynamically transformed for interchanging semantic-based information into RDF documents via XSL stylesheets. The CIMWOS Retrieval Engine {{is based on a}} weighted boolean model with intelligent indexing components.
