40|$|Although jetmilling {{is a very}} energy {{consuming}} grinding process it is increasingly used in industry because very fine grinding product with a narrow size distribution is attained without contamination as the milling occurs by inter particle collisions. At Delft University a project has been started to achieve a considerable energy reduction of the milling process. Main feature of the improved grinding system will be an operation control based on in-line particle size measurement using the laser diffraction technique. The pilot plant is equipped with an external classifier for the removal and recirculation of larger particles leaving the <b>jet</b> <b>mill.</b> Phenomena occurring in the mill are not yet well modeled and thus no real optimization of the grinding process can be achieved. Operation conditions of <b>jet</b> <b>mills</b> are still determined by trial and error. This paper is to {{form the basis of}} a model which allows a dynamic modeling of the behavior of the jet mill/classifier system. The closed loop grinding system has been split in 3 subsystems (zones), two internal to the mill and one external through which the particles pass.

40|$|Dry milling in {{combination}} with air classification was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional wet extraction of protein from yellow field peas (Pisum sativum). Major advantages of dry fractionation are retention of native functionality of proteins and its lower energy and water use. Peas were ground by impact (ZPS 50) and <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> (AFG 100) at various classifier wheel speeds to provide pea flours with different particle size distributions, protein contents and damaged starch levels. Peas were milled under various conditions to maximally disentangle starch granules from the surrounding protein bodies. The optimal milling conditions were confirmed by particle size analysis and scanning electron microscope imaging. Too extensive milling, e. g. using ultrafine impact or <b>jet</b> <b>milling,</b> resulted in very fine flours (with D 0. 5 < 10 µm) with poor flowability, whereas ultrafine <b>jet</b> <b>milling</b> led to an increased percentage of damaged starch. Subsequently, air classification was applied to separate small fragments (primarily protein bodies) from the coarse fraction (starch granules) to obtain enriched protein concentrates. Protein concentrates were obtained with protein contents between 51 % and 55 % (w/dw) and a maximum protein recovery of 77 %. Deviating cut-off size for air classification could be ascribed to build-up of material between the vanes of the classifier wheel.

A liquid pea concentrate comprising 26 % (w/w) of protein could be prepared from dry pea concentrates containing more than 30 % (w/dw) of pea protein.

Pure spray dried isoniazid yielded particles too large for pulmonary delivery, but the addition of 5 % of L-leucine resulted in spray dried particles of inhalable size. DSC data showed complete crystallinity for all samples, while TGA analysis showed that isoniazid sublimates around 100 °C. SEM imaging showed that pure <b>jet</b> <b>milled</b> and spray dried isoniazid particles fused together. Isoniazid spray dried with L-leucine resulted in spherical particles with no fusion visible. The most likely explanation for particle fusion is that isoniazid crystalizes, resulting in solid bridge formation. L-leucine however, forms a coating around isoniazid particles, thereby preventing this phenomenon. Further experiments are needed to show why isoniazid fuses together in the <b>jet</b> <b>mill.</b> A possible explanation is that some isoniazid sublimates due to heat generation during particle collisions, and causes solid bridge formation between particles when it ripens. Further experiments have to show whether isoniazid co-spray dried with L-leucine disperses efficiently and is stable over time...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{theoretical}} studies, {{complete picture of}} a mechanical processing of sulfur in the disintegrator is given. Kinematic and dynamic characteristics of elastic and inelastic collisions of particles of processed rhombic sulfur with rows of disintegrator fingers are calculated. Based on {{the analysis of the}} obtained dependency of the rotation frequency of the rotors offers, advices on selecting optimal conditions for activation milling of α-sulfur in the disintegrator are given. These results can be partially used in the processing of sulfur and in other types of shock grinding devices, in particular, <b>jet</b> <b>mills...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the help}} of the {{scanning}} electron microscope, the superfine powders produced from 8 kinds of materials by <b>Jet</b> <b>Mill</b> were experimentally investigated and were qualitatively analyzed based on the stress wave theory and the crystallography theory. It was found that the crystal structure had a decisive influence on the shape of particles, and the shape of non-crystal particles occurred at random. The particle materials produced from intensive impulsive loading maintained their original properties. The unbalanced crack extension, which caused by the defects of materials or other factors, was the main factor of material destruction...|$|R
