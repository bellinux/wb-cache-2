Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E

Furthermore, mutual listening, reported by either member of the dyad, had a positive effect on the <b>knowledge</b> <b>gain</b> of the less popular member, whereas dominance of the more popular member negatively affected the <b>knowledge</b> <b>gain</b> of the less popular member. These findings suggest that prior knowledge of the more popular dyad member affects the learning of the less popular dyad member and that the quality of the collaboration between both dyad members appears to affect the outcome for the less popular dyad member; more mutual listening and less dominance presumably ensures equal participation and likely increases the chances of the less popular dyad member to participate sufficiently in the collaboration process...|$|R

The results were the Learning Objects students’ <b>knowledge</b> <b>gain</b> was higher than the PowerPoint students, while females scored higher using the PowerPoint and males scored higher using the Learning Object. The implications of this study are that instructors in any discipline could better serve their students if they investigate using Learning Objects in their online learning rather than the use of PowerPoint. The majority of students who used the Learning Object online performed better than students who listened to the PowerPoint, supporting the contention that student-accessed learning leads to greater cognition.

40|$|Teaching {{programs}} {{are being built}} throughout the world to make learning easier and more effective. Many of these {{programs are}} assumed to produce a change in behavior {{of the students in}} the direction of stated objectives of the programs. A satisfactory performance by the students on tests which are written for the programs is usually assumed to be a reflection of the effectiveness of the programs without considering the influence of knowledge which the studentsbring into the programs. The pre-instructional knowledge of students should be separated from their post-instructional knowledge when assessments of the effects of instruction are conducted. In order to establish a framework for examining the effects of specific instructional tasks at the demonstration stations for the biology program for non-biology majors at Ball State University, a cyclic model for evaluating and instructing students was designed. The present study involved only the evaluating phase of the model. Four multiple-choice test items were written for each of 97 demonstration stations. A total of 388 multiple-choice test items constituted the measurement instrument for the study. A minimum of 50 students were tested before and after instructions at each of the 97 stations. Students arrived at the demonstration stations with varying degrees of related knowledge. Although significant <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains</b> occurred at each of the 97 demonstration stations, students acquired substantially larger amounts of knowledge at some stations than at others. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains</b> (which reflect the interaction-product of individuals' natural capabilities and the effects of instruction) were ranked for the nine units into which the program was sub-divided. This ranking reflects <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains</b> on a relative scale. Students' pre-instructional knowledge of some units was low with the result that when pre-instructional scores were subtracted from post-instructional scores the <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains</b> were high with correspondingly high ranking in <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains.</b> This does not necessarily mean that the total knowledge of the student is high for such units. When the mean post-test scores for each unit were ranked, an estimate of the relative total amount of knowledge of the students after they interacted with the instructional materials was obtained. These rankings are considered valid only to the extent that the measurement instrument measured the constructs it purports to measure. Students' <b>knowledge</b> <b>gains</b> were substantial enough to encourage continual use of the demonstration stations. However, data indicate that demonstration stations should be examined and that revision should be initiated which could enhance the learning experiences provided for students. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
