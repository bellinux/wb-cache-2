50|$|Wear is a {{mechanical}} material degradation process occurring on rubbing or impacting surfaces, while corrosion involves chemical or electrochemical {{reactions of the}} material. Corrosion may accelerate wear and wear may accelerate corrosion. One then speaks of corrosion accelerated wear or wear accelerated corrosion. Both these phenomena, as well as fretting corrosion (which results from small amplitude oscillations between contacting surfaces) fall into the broader category of tribocorrosion. <b>Erosion-corrosion</b> is another tribocorrosion phenomenon involving mechanical and chemical effects: impacting particles or fluids erode a solid surface by abrasion, chipping or fatigue while simultaneously the surface corrodes.|$|E
50|$|If {{the general}} water speed or {{the degree of}} local {{turbulence}} in an installation is high, the protective film that would normally be formed on a copper tube {{as a result of}} slight initial corrosion, may be torn off the surface locally, permitting further corrosion to take place at that point. If this process continues it can produce deep localised attack of the type known as <b>erosion-corrosion</b> or impingement damage. The actual attack on the metal is by the corrosive action of the water to which it is exposed while the erosive factor is the mechanical removal of the corrosion product from the surface.|$|E
50|$|Impingement attack {{produces}} highly characteristic water-swept pits, {{which are}} often horseshoe shaped, or it can produce broader areas of attack. The {{leading edge of the}} pit is frequently undercut by the swirling action of the water. Usually, the surface of the metal within the pits or areas of attack is smooth and carries no substantial corrosion product. <b>Erosion-corrosion</b> is known to occur in pumped-circulation hot water distribution systems, and even in cold water distribution systems, if the water velocities are too high. The factors influencing the attack include the chemical character of the water passing through the system, the temperature, the average water velocity in the system and the presence of any local features likely to induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|E
40|$|<b>Erosion-corrosion</b> or tribo-corrosion poses {{a threat}} to {{materials}} which are subjected to conditions involving corrosive slurries. Industries suffering from <b>erosion-corrosion</b> include the automotive, aviation, pump, mining and petroleum industries. The rate of material removal due to <b>erosion-corrosion</b> can be very different to the damage caused by the individual components, i. e. erosion and corrosion. Hard and corrosion resistant coatings have been produced to resist this combined attack. Coatings include thermally sprayed coatings, composite cermets, multilayer and monolithically grown PVD coatings. They have improved wear and corrosion resistance owing to their high hardness and use of noble metals. Previous work on the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of CrN/NbN superlattice coatings has shown variation in the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanisms and volume loss with change in impact angle and applied potential. Yet the effect of velocity on the transitions between <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanisms of superlattice CrN/NbN PVD coatings is unexplored. The present work investigates the velocity effects on <b>erosion-corrosion</b> behaviour of range of multilayer CrN/NbN "superlattice" PVD coatings against that of uncoated M 2 tool steel. This work discusses the possible interaction between <b>erosion-corrosion</b> for CrN/NbN PVD coatings. <b>Erosion-corrosion</b> mechanism maps and wastage maps have been generated based on the results to depict the changing mechanisms of material degradation with impact angle and changing velocity.

40|$|<b>Erosion-corrosion</b> of {{materials}} in aqueous environments {{is a complex}} phenomenon involving {{a very large number}} of variables. In such cases, characteristics of the target, particle and the environment affect the degradation mechanism. Predicting material behaviour may sometimes be a "black art" due to the parameter size which is involved in such processes. In studies of <b>erosion-corrosion,</b> there have been significant advances in the modelling of such processes in recent years. Various methodologies employed include quasi-static modelling, using CFD modelling and <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mapping. In such cases, the output of the various models can differ significantly. In this work, a methodology combining CFD modelling and <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mapping has been developed to model <b>erosion-corrosion</b> behaviour of pure metals, which variously passivate and dissolve under a range of simulated conditions. This provides a means of mapping the component undergoing <b>erosion-corrosion</b> and thus is a step change on previous modelling work in this area as it enables superimposition of the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> map on real surfaces. The relative advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A new {{development}} {{in the study of}} <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanisms in aqueous conditions has been the construction of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> maps. Such maps show the transitions between the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> 'regimes' {{as a function of the}} main erosion and corrosion variables. The maps can also be used to optimize the process parameters to minimize the wastage. The aim of this work has been to demonstrate the generalized effect of impact angle on the boundaries of the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> map, by combining mathematical models of solid particle erosion at various impact angles with those for aqueous corrosion. The effects were investigated for carbon steel. <b>Erosion-corrosion</b> maps were constructed based on the model predictions, showing the transition boundaries as a function of velocity and electrochemical potential. The results were used to generate particle velocity-impact angle maps demonstrating the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanism and wastage level. It was shown that the degradation mode varied significantly as a function of increasing impact angle. Implications of using various erosion models (showing different erosion rate predictions as a function of impact angle), for the generation of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> maps, are also addressed in this paper.

40|$|The {{presence}} of sand in production {{lines in the}} oil and gas industries causes material degradation due to <b>erosion-corrosion.</b> The material degradation caused by <b>erosion-corrosion</b> in pipelines can result in a high cost of monitoring and maintenance and in major accidents. The process of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> consists of erosion, corrosion, and their interactions. Investigating and understanding how the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> process affects the degradation process in certain materials will allow for a reduction in economic loss and help prevent accidents. In this study, material loss due to <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of mild steel under impingement of sand-laden water at 90 ˚ impingement angle is investigated using a submerged impingement jet (SIJ) test. In particular, effects of jet velocity and sand loading on TWL due to <b>erosion-corrosion,</b> weight loss due to pure erosion and <b>erosion-corrosion</b> interactions, at a temperature of 29 - 33 °C in sea water environment (3. 5 % NaCl), are analyzed. The results show that the velocity and sand loading have a great influence on the removal of materials, and erosion is more dominant under all conditions studied.

However, there has been no work carried out to map the effects of parameters in oil/water slurries. This paper investigates the effect of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> on carbon steel in oil field production and maps the results.

However, the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> rate appeared to be dependent on particle sizes for size ranges from 50 to 100 μm but above this value, this dependence was reduced. <b>Erosion-corrosion</b> mechanism and wastage maps were constructed based on the results showing the variation in <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regimes, as a function of particle size and electrochemical potential...|$|E
40|$|<b>Erosion-corrosion</b> {{by either}} solid {{particle}} or liquid impact {{in a wide}} variety of industrial environments which range from coal conversion processes to steam turbines in nuclear power generation. The effects of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> depend on properties of the particle, the target and the nature of the corrosion environment. Various regimes of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> interaction have been identified, ranging from ''erosion-dominated'' (erosion of the substrate) to ''corrosion-dominated'' (erosion of the corrosion product). In studies of <b>erosion-corrosion,</b> the effects of impact velocity are generally not well understood. In some environments in which corrosion occurs, high velocity exponents have been reported have been reported, while, in others, the values are close to 1. In addition, the effects of alloy corrosion resistance in environments of different velocities have been puzzling with differences in the exponents reported, as alloy corrosion resistance is increased. This paper considers the effect of velocity for various <b>erosion-corrosion</b> studies from the literature. The effects of alloy corrosion resistance for such results are evaluated. Some general provisos for the interpretation of the effects of velocity will be made for alloys of different corrosion resistance in <b>erosion-corrosion</b> environments. It is shown that relative <b>erosion-corrosion</b> resistance of alloys in one environment cannot be used arbitrarily to predict resistance in other environments, particularly if parameters such as velocity are varied significantly...|$|E
40|$|For {{the erosion}} of alloys under aqueous conditions, {{there have been some}} recent {{attempts}} to identify the transitions between the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regimes using laboratory results. Such transitions can be superimposed on an <b>erosion-corrosion</b> map {{as a function of the}} main corrosion and erosion variables. Defining the magnitude of the wastage rate on such maps enables the relevant process parameters involved in the damage process to be optimized. The object of this work was to model the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> behaviour of mild steel exposed to an aqueous solution containing alumina particles. The results were used to identify the transitions between the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regimes on <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanism maps. Process control maps, which show the magnitude of the wastage rate, were also constructed using such an approach. This paper describes the basis of the mathematical models used to construct the boundaries on the maps. The effects of particle size, flux, and solution pH on such boundaries are demonstrated.

40|$|In {{studies of}} <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of {{materials}} in aqueous conditions, {{there have been}} various attempts to define regimes of interaction. Such regimes indicate whether erosion or corrosion may dominate the wastage mechanism. However, intermediate regimes in which corrosion and erosion {{interact with each other}} may lead to situations where the wastage is far greater than the sum of the processes acting separately. A common method of defining <b>erosion-corrosion</b> interactions has been to distinguish between the regime in which erosion enhances the corrosion rate (the so called "additive effect" because the corrosion contribution can be measured electrochemically and thus added to the erosion contribution to assess the overall wastage rate) and the regime where corrosion enhances erosion (the so-called "synergistic" effect). However, regimes of <b>erosion-corrosion,</b> where corrosion impedes the erosion are also of great importance mechanistically, and usually these are termed as exhibiting "negative synergism". Defining the conditions in which a transition from "positive" to "negative synergism" occurs, is useful in order to optimize the parameters to minimize the wastage rate. This paper reviews the rationale that has been used to define <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regimes in aqueous conditions as part of a study of the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of Fe at various pHs. The mathematical definitions are discussed in relation to practical <b>erosion-corrosion</b> problems. In addition, a new "antagonistic" <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regime is proposed to properly define the concept of "negative synergism"...|$|E

However, identifying such effects is difficult because in aqueous conditions, the corrosion and erosion variables are not independent of each other. In this work, some new developments on the modelling of slurry <b>erosion-corrosion</b> processes are described for steels.

This is despite the fact cermet-based coatings are being increasingly used to combat erosion on pipelines and pumps where the degradation is caused by a combination of sand particles and seawater. In addition, the interactions between the processes of erosion and corrosion have only been evaluated for a limited range of conditions, despite the fact that <b>erosion-corrosion</b> occurs over a wide range of variables in practice. In this study, the effects of velocity, particle concentration and potential were evaluated for a WC/Co-Cr based coating. The extent of wastage was assessed using scanning electron microscopy and weight loss techniques. Mechanisms of <b>erosion-corrosion</b> were identified from the results. The results were used to generate <b>erosion-corrosion</b> mechanism maps for the coated and uncoated specimens.

The program of experiments assessed the potential of two corrosion inhibitors to control adequately the material degradation caused by static corrosion, flow-induced corrosion, and <b>erosion-corrosion</b> on the three regions. Static corrosion tests were performed using linear polarization in carbon dioxide (CO 2) -saturated conditions. Flow-induced corrosion and <b>erosion-corrosion</b> experiments were conducted using a submerged impinging jet (SIJ) in CO 2 -saturated conditions at a fluid velocity of 7 m/s with sand loadings of 0 mg/L and 100 mg/L.

40|$|The {{effects of}} preoxidation as a {{potential}} protective measure for alloys exposed to <b>erosion-corrosion</b> have been evaluated for Incoloy 800 H in laboratory simulated fluidised bed conditions. The performance of the specimens after exposure to such environments was estimated from weight change data, electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction patterns. The results showed that, in 'corrosion dominated' conditions, i. e. at relatively high temperatures and low velocities, preoxidation was successful in reducing the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of the underlying alloy. However, when the velocity was increased and the temperature decreased, preoxidation afforded only some short term protection to the alloy. In these more 'erosion-corrosion dominated' regimes, preoxidation delayed the incubation period for <b>erosion-corrosion</b> of the alloy, but, once the scale was removed, the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> rates {{were similar to those}} of the non-preoxidised alloys.

40|$|<b>Erosion–corrosion</b> is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} which involves {{the interaction between the}} mechanical processes of solid particle erosion and the electrochemical processes of corrosion. A whole range of issues is faced by a designer when trying to obtain relevant information on <b>erosion–corrosion</b> performance of a material. Amongst the constraints are the dispersed test conditions and test rigs available in the literature making comparisons and quantifying <b>erosion–corrosion</b> wear rates of different materials very difficult. The aim of this work is to evaluate the repeatability of <b>erosion–corrosion</b> experiments and to investigate the role of different parameters influencing <b>erosion–corrosion.</b> The materials tested in this work are stainless steel (SS 316 L/UNS S 31603), carbon steel (AISI 1020 /UNS G 10200) and nickel-aluminium bronze (NAB/UNS C 63200). A slurry pot erosion tester was used as the test apparatus and test parameters such as erodent size, erodent concentration, flow velocity and test solutions were varied to study their effect on <b>erosion–corrosion.</b> SEM analysis showed that a similar <b>erosion–corrosion</b> mechanism is seen for SS 316 L and NAB with formation of multiple extruded lips and platelets typically seen for erosion dominated material. In contrast the surface of AISI 1020 revealed the formation of craters, pits and shallow indentations which suggests that corrosion mechanism has a dominant influence on the material. Error rates in tests were found to have an average of 5. 5 % which are relatively low indicating good repeatability of test measurements and data from the test rig. The <b>erosion–corrosion</b> resistance of AISI 1020, SS 316 L and NAB were compared and it was found that SS 316 L showed the lowest <b>erosion–corrosion</b> mass loss rates in all test conditions followed by NAB and then AISI 1020. However in terms of synergistic ranking, NAB showed the best resistance to the combined action of erosion and corrosion with the highest negative synergy value. Positive synergy was evident for AISI 1020 in 3. 5 % NaCl and SS 316 L in 0. 3 M HCl. A wear map is presented to evaluate <b>erosion–corrosion</b> trends of the materials.

Accurate spectrometric measurements of eroded iron concentration in the drain flow were carried out in order to characterize the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> severity in the bend. Both the flow Reynolds number and sand particle concentration were directly correlated to the onset of erosion phenomena.

In particular, predictive models have been developed for steels to chart transitions between <b>erosion-corrosion</b> regimes. Such regimes identify whether the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> process is affected by active dissolution or passivation processes in the aqueous environment. A very important development in the study of aqueous corrosion of pure metals has been the concept of the corrosion map, developed by Pourbaix in the last century. Such maps identify regimes of corrosion, ranging from immunity to active dissolution and to passivation, as a function of pH and electrochemical potential. The position of the boundaries, {{as a function of the}} latter variables, may differ significantly for various pure metals. This paper models the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> behaviour for a range of pure metals, i. e.

The overall <b>erosion-corrosion</b> behaviour and the direct corrosion component were monitored using gravimetric and electrochemical-monitoring techniques. Contributes from mechanical erosions were assessed by cathodically protecting specimens under impingement conditions. The research also considered the influence of various parameters such as temperature, time, velocity, salinity variations, and impingement angle. The extent and morphology of material deterioration and protective film formation under various environmental conditions were assessed, utilizing surface profiling equipment and light optical and scanning electron microscopy. The work has quantified the complex contributions of corrosion, erosion and synergy to the overall <b>erosion-corrosion</b> material loss.

They have proven that the <b>erosion-corrosion</b> rate increases directly with increasing impact velocity of particles.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an example-based discussion of <b>erosion–corrosion</b> and flow corrosion processes {{that have been}} identified using electrochemical noise measurements. Various single and dual phase corrosion and <b>erosion–corrosion</b> experiments on austenitic stainless steels and various thermally sprayed coatings using jet impingement and pipe flow rigs are discussed. Localised corrosion events, metastable and propagating pitting, passive and general corrosion processes have been identified under various flow conditions of NaCl solutions. Oscillations in the electrochemical potential noise signals have been related to an erosion-enhanced corrosion synergistic effect. Electrochemical noise measurements show responses to electrolyte permeation of the coating, coating erosion penetration and substrate activity under <b>erosion–corrosion</b> conditions...|$|E
