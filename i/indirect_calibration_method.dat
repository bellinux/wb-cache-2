40|$|To {{develop a}} novel micro-force sensor that can {{reliably}} measure {{force in the}} range of sub-micro-Newton (μN), the signal processing method and a novel <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> are designed and realized in this paper. The relationship model between the micro-force acting on the sensor's probe tip and the deflection of the probe tip is built up. With the above model and the standard deflection input, the novel <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> completes calibrating the relationship model between the micro-force and the output voltage of the sensor and solves the problem that standard micro-force used in calibration is difficult to find. Experiment results show the signal processing method and the new <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> are effective and correct. The signal processing method and the <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> are indispensable to developing the sub-μN micro-force sensor and providing a feasible and versatile solution in micro contact-force sensing and feedback control for micro/nano assembly and manipulation.

40|$|Abstract This article {{discusses}} calibration {{issues for}} shallow depth nanoindentation experiments with Berkovich tips {{with respect to}} the accurate measurement of the diamond area function (DAF). For this purpose, two different calibration procedures are compared: (i) the direct measurement of the DAF through atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the Berkovich tip at shallow depth and (ii) a novel <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> based on an iterative robust and converging scheme in which both reduced modulus and indentation hardness are simultaneously used. These results are obtained by indentation measurements on a standard specimen of fused silica, performed in the 0. 5 ? 200 mN load range with a Berkovich indenter. Direct tip shape measurements were carried out through different AFM methods. Comparisons with the standard indirect calibration procedure are also reported. For both the indirect calibration procedures a sensitivity and convergence study is presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the need to}} have calibrated cameras in surgery rooms. Data can then be collected during surgeries to assist the surgeons and it can later be used for postoperation analysis. Typical techniques for camera calibration are not adequate for a medical environment due to the cameras constantly moving and with no rigid area always in the cameras’ view. The proposed approach is to calibrate cameras attached to surgical lights by utilizing extra cameras placed on the ceiling. The ceiling cameras find the position of the light cameras and calibrate their extrinsic parameters. This <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> provides an accurate method of camera calibration without limiting the normal operations of the surgeons. On average the indirect calibration was able to locate the light camera to 4. 81 mm of the position found by a standard camera calibration. The indirect calibration was also able to perform simple tracking to within 1. 28 mm of the location given by direct calibration. Finally, an error equation was created that is able to provide a rough estimate of the error expected from the system with a custom setup...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{potential}} of discharge-based <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> of the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), a lumped rainfall-runoff (RR) model, is examined for six selected catchments in Flanders. The concept of <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> indicates {{that one has to}} estimate the calibration data because the catchment is ungauged. A first case in which <b>indirect</b> <b>calibration</b> is applied is that of spatial gauging divergence: Because no observed discharge records are available at the outlet of the ungauged catchment, the calibration is carried out based on a rescaled discharge time series of a very similar donor catchment. Both a calibration in the time domain and the frequency domain (a. k. a. spectral domain) are carried out. Furterhermore, the case of temporal gauging divergence is considered: Limited (e. g. historical or very recent) discharge records are available at the outlet of the ungauged catchment. Additionally, no time overlap exists between the forcing and discharge records. Therefore, only an <b>indirect</b> spectral <b>calibration</b> can be performed in this case. To conclude also the combination case of spatio-temporal gauging divergence is considered. In this last case only limited discharge records are available at the outlet of a donor catchment. Again the forcing and discharge records are not contemporaneous which only makes feasible an <b>indirect</b> spectral <b>calibration.</b> The modelled discharge time series are found to be acceptable in all three considered cases. In the case of spatial gauging divergence, <b>indirect</b> temporal <b>calibration</b> results in a slightly better model performance than <b>indirect</b> spectral <b>calibration.</b> Furthermore, <b>indirect</b> spectral <b>calibration</b> in the case of temporal gauging divergence leads to a better model performance than <b>indirect</b> spectral <b>calibration</b> in the case of spatial gauging divergence.

By contrast, even though {{a few studies have}} compared the separate and concurrent <b>calibration</b> <b>methods</b> for full multidimensional IRT (MIRT) models or applied the concurrent <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> to vertical scaling using the bifactor model, no study has yet provided technical descriptions of the concurrent and fixed parameter <b>calibration</b> <b>methods</b> for any MIRT models. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation was to extend the concurrent and fixed parameter <b>calibration</b> <b>methods</b> for UIRT models to the two-tier item factor analysis model. In addition, the relative performance of the separate, concurrent, and fixed parameter <b>calibration</b> <b>methods</b> was compared in terms of the recovery of item parameters and accuracy of IRT observed score equating using both real and simulated datasets. The separate, concurrent, and fixed parameter <b>calibration</b> <b>methods</b> well recovered the item parameters, with the concurrent <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> performing slightly better than the other two linking methods. Despite the comparable performance of the three linking methods in terms of the recovery of item parameters, however, some discrepancy was observed between the IRT observed score equating results obtained with the three linking methods. In general, the concurrent <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> provided equating results with the smallest equating error, whereas the separate <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> provided equating results with the largest equating error due to the largest standard error of equating. The performance of the fixed parameter <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> depended on the proportion of common items.
