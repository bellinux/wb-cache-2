50|$|Critics of Le Roy Ladurie {{have argued}} that the Holy Inquisition was an {{instrument}} of <b>judicial</b> <b>repression</b> for whom torture or the threat of torture were routine methods. The Canadian historian Norman Cantor argued that none of the people questioned by Fournier had appeared willingly before the Holy Inquisition, and that therefore the Fournier Register which Le Roy Ladurie had used as his main source for Montaillou is not reliable. Other critics have noted that the people questioned by Fournier spoke in Occitan, had their remarks written down in Latin and that Le Roy Ladurie had translated the text into French and have wondered if something has been lost in the translation.|$|E
40|$|Published in 1969, Hobsbawm and Rudé’s Captain Swing {{remains the}} sole {{national}} {{account of the}} so-called “Swing riots” that diffused throughout most of rural southern, central, and eastern England in the autumn and winter of 1830. Whilst much revisionist work has been published since, Hobsbawm and Rudé’s contention that Swing’s brutal <b>judicial</b> <b>repression</b> effectively ended the protests has remained essentially unchallenged. Through an archival re-examination of the resort to protest between the 1830 trials and December 1833, this paper contends that the received understanding that Swing was crushed is too simplistic. In some locales, Swing maintained its momentum, in others it revived. Swing also morphed into different forms, both real and phantasmagorical. But the intensity of protests did decline. By the autumn of 1833, protests were less frequent, now representing a fractured, isolated spatiality instead of a coherent protest campaign...|$|E
40|$|Why {{have some}} democracies made {{considerable}} progress in prosecuting dictatorship-era {{human rights violations}} or in publicly exposing the truth about repression while others still have amnesty laws that prevent, or at least hinder, even the judicial review of such abuses? This article compares Spain, Chile and Argentina to understand {{the impact of their}} contrasting histories of repression on how they have dealt with their violent pasts. I assess whether a greater degree of legal <b>repression</b> and direct <b>judicial</b> involvement in <b>repression</b> explains why there is more resistance to prosecuting those responsible for human rights violations, establishing truth commissions or annulling the political sentences of the past during democratization. Once democracy has been consolidated, different dynamics may emerge, but this history of judicial complicity {{has proved to be a}} key factor in understanding the continuous lack of judicial accountability in Spain...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{the debate about the}} role of Stalin in the Soviet famine of 1932 – 33. It provides data on Stalin’s statements and actions in 1932 – 33, <b>judicial</b> and extra-judicial <b>repression,</b> and the process by which the 1933 deportation targets were drastically reduced. It is suggested that starvation was a cheap substitute for the cancelled deportations. It is argued that in 1932 – 33 Stalin pursued a multi-pronged policy of state terror against the population of the USSR. Some general issues of interpretation are also considered, such as Bolshevik perceptions, the characterisation of Soviet industrialisation, and approaches to Soviet history. Extensive attention is given to the classification of Stalin’s actions according to national and international criminal law. In particular, {{the question of whether or}} not in 1932 – 33 the Ukrainian people were victims of genocide, is analysed. Attentively studying the author’s text, not only do [specialists] not stint their compliments, but they also make some critical remarks. Because (is it necessary to prove the obvious?) any really good book invites discussion (Ivanov 2006, p. 120). The Stalinist leadership was only able to retain power then [in 1932] by using the most savage repression (Khlevnyuk 1992, p. 11) ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{explores the}} role of {{denunciation}} and collusion in driving the post Civil War <b>judicial</b> <b>repression</b> in Spain between 1939 and 1945. It argues {{that in recent years}} historians have done much valuable work to unearth the long hidden Francoist repression, but that much remains to be learnt about the complicity that lay behind the mass killing and incarceration. Accordingly, to help further our understanding of collaboration in the repression, the article offers a case study of the launching of prosecution in military tribunals. It shows that regime officials and their supporters in the community often conspired to herd their mutual political enemies through farcical summary prosecutions. It also demonstrates that in a significant number of cases the authorities followed the lead of their civilian collaborators who singled out potential victims for them. Thus it concludes that the Franco regime did not simply impose itself on society but that its supporters at the grassroots played an important role consolidating it from below...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{collectivization}} in the area which was the called Svitavy National District Committee. The thesis represents economic and social transformation after the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. First chapter serves general characteristic of Svitavy District and Svitavy National District Committee which was the intermediary among the government and individual vil- lages. The next chapter focuses on the process of collectivization in Svitavy District divided into three phases - first phase (1949 - 1953), second phase (1953 - 1954) and third phase (1954 - 1960). Regional development is associated with nationwide con- texts which were connected {{with the process of}} collectivization. The following chap- ter devotes to individual process of collectivization in selected villages. The author attempts to show the peculiarities of realization of collectivization on the base of micro-historical insight. The aim of the last chapter is to outline the mechanism of <b>judicial</b> <b>repression</b> against private farmers. The main attention is focused on emi- nent local private farmer František Blažek. The trial of František Blažek became de- terrent tool which should accelerate the liquidation of "kulaks". The thesis describes the distinctions among the newly settled villages (by Czech people) [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Last July’s riots {{provoked}} a media storm, political outcry and unprecedented <b>judicial</b> <b>repression.</b> Central to this response was {{the view that}} the riots must be condemned not only for the widespread levels of destruction caused, but because, unlike previous social eruptions, they were not linked to any identifiable political cause. Rather than being an expression of anger about social injustice they were said to be a product of selfishness and greed. Media discourse focused on the shops looted and goods taken: designer sportswear, name brand trainers and causal clothing, alongside fast-moving consumer goods such as flat screen TVs and Play Stations. This paper analyses the riots, drawing on both recent work on the impact of class inequality and relative deprivation alongside the classical sociology of fashion and consumption, notably Simmel, Veblen and Bourdieu. Building on this framework, it unpacks the figure of the feral teenager as the ‘marginalised consumer’ of contemporary culture. Using a Marxist approach to brands, as commodity fetishism par excellence, it argues fashion’s imputed democratic potential continues to be marred by its status as a ‘child of capitalism’ and, that the riots arose as a consequence of an era of intensified commodification, alienation, social division and contradiction in neo-liberal capitalism...|$|E
40|$|Com a instauração do regime militar no Brasil em 1964 e a decretação do Ato Institucional no. 2 (AI- 2) em 1965, os civis que cometiam crimes contra a Segurança Nacional passaram a ser julgados pela Justiça Militar. O presente estudo analisa os processos políticos movidos contra a Vanguarda Popular Revolucionária (VPR), no período de 1969 a 1971, {{principal}}mente aqueles que se referem ao seu principal líder Carlos Lamarca. Trata-se da compreensão das facetas da Justiça Militar, buscando apreender na lógica dos textos dos processos seus objetivos e significado histórico. Sendo que a atuação da Justiça revelou-se extremamente complexa, no julgamento dos militantes de uma das principais organizações de esquerda que empreendeu a luta armada contra o regime. A pesquisa abordou a relação entre a administração da Justiça e o Estado, os mecanismos de repressão denunciados nos tribunais, como a tortura, desaparecimento e mortes de militantes e as irregularidades na aplicação da legislação. A figura emblemática de Carlos Lamarca que permeia todas as fases dos processo, o perfil dos réus e da organização, as formas de atuação e estratégias adotadas pelos representantes do Ministério Público e advogados de defesa. O enfoque centrou-se no rigor da Justiça em defesa da Segurança Nacional e na repressão judicial como parte das práticas repressivas do regime, em que legalidade e ilegalidade não se separavam. With the instauration of {{the military}} government in Brazil, in 1964, and the Institutional Act no. 2 (IA- 2), in 1965, the civilians who committed crimes against national security started facing trials in the Military Justice. The following study analizes the political processes moved against the "Vanguarda Popular Revolucionária" (PRV - Popular Revolutionary Vanguard), between 1969 and 1971, particulary those concerning its main leader, Carlos Lamarca. It deals with the comprehension of the many aspects of Military Justice, trying to learn, in {{the logic of the}} processes texts, its goals and historical meaning. The acts of the Justice revealed themselves as being extremely complex while judging the active members of one of the main left organizations that fought the Military Government. This research treated subjects like the relation of Justice and State, the repression mechanisms denounced in court, like torture, kidnapping and the killing of militants, and the irregularities in the applications of the law. It also deals with the emblematic figure of Carlos Lamarca, who appears during the whole process, the profile of defendants and their organization, the ways and strategies of both the Public Ministry (who acted as Prosecutor) and the defense lawyers. The attention focused on the rigorous way the justice acted in defense of the national security, and in the <b>judicial</b> <b>repression</b> {{as a part of the}} repressive acts of State, where legal and illegal were very similar...|$|E
