5|$|One of Ford's <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> {{was dealing}} with the {{continued}} Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One of the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> has been the classification of the aye-aye, {{which has been a}} topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
5|$|The game took {{approximately}} 21 {{months to}} complete; Rocksteady began development {{with a team}} of 40, which had expanded to around 60 by the game's completion. Combat was considered one of the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> in developing the game; the system went through three iterations. Rocksteady originally developed the game's combat as a full rhythm action game. It was later set in 2D, which involved colored circles crashing into each other during fights; the final system was based on this 2D model. Combat was designed to be unique for Batman, and was given a simple control scheme to reflect the ease with which Batman can perform the moves. Arkham Asylum was built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Eidos president Ian Livingstone said one developer spent two years programming Batman's cape, using over 700 animations and sound effects to make it move realistically.|$|E

25|$|The anti-literacy laws after 1832 contributed {{greatly to}} the problem of {{widespread}} illiteracy facing the freedmen and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later.

This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} team sought {{input from}} fans on various scenarios {{by means of}} an online survey and brought in trilogy co-creator, co-writer and co-producer Bob Gale as story consultant. Several concepts he and director Robert Zemeckis had originally conceived for Part II, such as the exploration of the Prohibition era and Doc's family history, were reworked into the game. Telltale Games found adhering to the films' established timelines {{to be one of the}} <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> regarding the development of the script. Many ideas had to be scrapped due to conflicts that would have caused paradoxes with the stories of the films. Gale stated that although the game is not part of the series canon, it is possible that it could take place in alternate timelines.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> {{to mankind}} {{always has been}} eradicating the {{presence}} of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands {{in our own country}} each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> is {{controlling}} or removing quantum decoherence. This {{usually means}} isolating the system from its environment as {{interactions with the}} external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually {{something that should be}} highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} development processes {{along the coast}} are influenced by a multitude of factors, comprising wave motions, micro and macro-tidal cycles and long shore currents typical to the coastal tract. The shore currents vary greatly along with the monsoon. These are also affected by cyclonic action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One of the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> people living on the Ganges Delta may face in coming years is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence {{in the region and}} partly by climate change.|$|E
25|$|The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples {{began in}} 1964 by a {{multinational}} team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working {{together under the}} UNESCO banner; it cost some USD $40 million at the time (equal to $300 million in 2017 dollars). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 meters higher and 200 meters back from the river, {{in one of the}} <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> of archaeological engineering in history. Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex.|$|E

500|$|In 1870, Stone and Blackwell {{founded the}} Woman's Journal, an eight-page weekly {{newspaper}} based in Boston. [...] Originally intended primarily to voice {{the concerns of}} the NEWSA and the AWSA, by the 1880s it had become an unofficial voice of the suffrage movement as a whole. Stone edited the journal {{for the rest of her}} life, assisted by her husband and their daughter Alice Stone Blackwell. [...] Stone did not collect a salary for her work on the paper, which required continual financial support. [...] One of her <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> was raising money to keep it going. [...] Its circulation reached a peak of 6,000, although in 1878 it was 2,000 less than it had been two years earlier.|$|E

This edition also marked the 25th anniversary of New Year's Rockin' Eve; Clark marked this accomplishment by discussing the <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> he had faced hosting the special; including {{being unable to}} hear his director over the loud crowds of Times Square, harsh weather conditions, and a year where the emcee {{had to contend with}} a group of 30 nude attendees in the background. Clark aimed to continue hosting the special through the year 2000. Ultimately, Clark hosted the program nearly uninterrupted through 2004.|$|E

500|$|Set {{designer}} Bruce Rodgers, who {{had worked}} with Madonna on the Drowned World Tour in 2001, was familiar with the singer's work ethic. Rodgers, director Hamish Hamilton and executive producer Ricky Kirshner met several times with Madonna's team, represented by choreographer Jamie King (who presented the show's initial concept). Rodgers developed a large, cross-shaped stage with a central platform accessible by five hidden lifts, bleachers with an escape system at the rear, four positions for the band to play, an area for slacklining at one edge and ramps at the two ends of the cross. At the front of the stage was a [...] white fabric, the main screen for the Moment Factory projections. Props included a Jimmie Martin-designed gold-leaf throne on a barge carried by 150 gladiators. Rodgers' <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> were getting the barge onstage and rehearsing the procession.|$|E
500|$|Several {{instrumental}} {{leaders of}} soldiers' aid and relief organizations came from Massachusetts. These included Dorothea Dix, who had traveled {{across the nation}} working to promote proper {{care for the poor}} and insane before the war. After the outbreak of the war, she convinced the U.S. Army to establish a Women's Nursing Bureau on April 23, 1861 and became the first woman to head a federal government bureau. [...] Although army officials were dubious about the use of female nurses, Dix proceeded to recruit many women who had previously been serving as unorganized volunteers. One of her <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges,</b> given the biases of the era, was to demonstrate that women could serve as competently as men in army hospitals. Dix had a reputation for rejecting nurses who were too young or attractive, believing that patients and surgeons alike would not take them seriously. [...] U.S. Army surgeons often resented the nurses of Dix's bureau, claiming that they were obstinate and did not follow military protocol. [...] Despite such obstacles, Dix was successful at placing female nurses in hospitals throughout the North.|$|E
500|$|Simon Woodroffe {{explained}} that the character of Simon {{was a mixture of}} Blackadder, Rincewind, and Guybrush, and that he was originally intended to be a trainee wizard, similar to Harry Potter. He also {{explained that}} he was invented because they needed a character to compete with characters such as Rincewind, and that the game was inspired by the Discworld books and Monkey Island. Mike Woodroffe said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons magic stories. The character was invented during a journey on the M5 motorway, and was not named after Woodroffe. The name [...] "Simon the Sorcerer" [...] had that format because of the magical nature of the character, and because other names, such as [...] "Willy The Wizard", were rejected because they were disliked. Simon the Sorcerer was developed by a team of 15 people. There was an effort to be British so as to distinguish themselves from the humour of Monkey Island. Simon Woodroffe stated that his <b>greatest</b> <b>challenges</b> were the script creation and puzzle design, and he tuned the scripts continuously. The world was created for the characters rather than the puzzles, and the story was wrapped around characters the team liked. Woodroffe believed that AdventureSoft were able to rival more experienced studios due to their small team, all of whom ad the same goals and passion for the game.|$|E
