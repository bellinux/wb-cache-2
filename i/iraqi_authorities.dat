5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission {{to assist the}} Iraqi security forces {{in conjunction with the}} US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E

50|$|A Palestinian {{exodus from}} Kuwait {{took place during}} and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the Iraqi {{occupation}} of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority</b> figures in Kuwait. After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991. Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein.|$|R
25|$|In September 2005, three murderers {{were the}} first people to be {{executed}} since the restoration. Then on 9 March 2006, an official of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council confirmed that <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> had executed the first insurgents by hanging.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} At the Center of the Storm, George Tenet writes: ... {{by the spring}} and summer of 2002, more than a dozen al-Qa'ida-affiliated extremists converged on Baghdad, with {{apparently}} no harassment on the part of the Iraqi government. They found a comfortable and secure environment in which they moved people and supplies to support Zarqawi's operations in northern Iraq. According to Tenet, while Zarqawi did find a safe haven in Iraq and did supervise camps in northeastern Iraq run by the Kurdish group Ansar al-Islam, [...] "the intelligence did not show any <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority,</b> direction, or control over any of the many specific terrorist acts carried out by al-Qa'ida." ...|$|R
25|$|In January 2005, a top bombmaker for Zarqawi's group, Abu Omar al-Koordi, was {{captured}} by the coalition and claimed his associates made the bomb used in this attack.

25|$|Following the raid, {{which left}} 34 dead, the PMOI {{released}} footage filmed and edited {{by members of}} the group, which show Iraqi soldiers firing at unarmed civilians at Camp Ashraf, and using military vehicles to herd and run down crowds of people. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities,</b> on the other hand, claimed that only three people were killed resisting a military operation to return land from camp residents to farmers.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Barzan, Mulla Mustafa {{recruited}} a force to challenge regional <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority.</b> Numbering nearly 750 in only two weeks, Barzani fighters began small operations such as raiding police stations and frontier posts. These early raids demonstrated the growing military organization of Barzani’s forces. Although still mostly tribal, enrollment in Barzani’s force grew to nearly 2,000 within months as local Kurds, including those deserting the Iraqi army, joined the ranks. [...] In order to organize this growing force, Barzani created combat groups of 15-30 men; appointed Muhammad Amin Mirkhan, Mamand Maseeh, and Saleh Kaniya Lanji commanders; and instilled strict rules of soldierly conduct.|$|R
50|$|High <b>Iraqi</b> Shiite <b>authorities,</b> such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani or Ayatollah Hussein Al-Sadr, {{called on}} the militants in the popular {{mobilization}} forces to avoid war crimes or other despicable behaviour and ad hoc government inquiry committees have been established {{in order to find}} the truth.|$|R

Salomi was released in March 2010 return {{for the release of}} 4 of their fighters being held in Iraqi custody. In total 450 members of the group have been handed over from US to Iraqi custody since the kidnapping of Peter Moore, over 250 of which have been released by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{paranoia}} {{that rose}} up around Hashimi's announcement and {{the reports that}} the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there to leave Iraq, believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities,</b> on the other hand, saw Kenneth O'Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi's authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites. Five of the 'trouble makers' {{were then asked to}} leave the country.|$|E
50|$|On 3 April 2017, the Kurdish National Council {{called on}} the PYD to release 4 of its detainees: a Kurdish Future Movement in Syria member, a Kurdish Youth Movement member, and two KDP-S members. As of the same day, 6 detainees were still held by <b>Iraqi</b> Kurdish <b>authorities.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mahmud Barzanji revolts were {{a series}} of armed uprisings by Kurdish Sheykh Mahmud Barzanji against the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority</b> in newly conquered British Mesopotamia and later the British Mandate in Iraq. Following his first insurrection in May 1919, Sheykh Mahmud was imprisoned and {{eventually}} exiled to India for a one-year period. When returning, he was once again appointed a governor, but shortly revolted again declaring himself as the ruler of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. The Kingdom of Kurdistan lasted from September 1922 - July 1924. With British forces greatly exceeding his in ammunition and training, the defeat finally subdued the region to central British Iraqi rule in 1924. Sheykh Mahmud retreated into mountains, and eventually reached terms with the independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, over his return from the underground. Sheykh Mahmud revolts are considered {{the first chapter of}} the modern Iraqi-Kurdish conflict.|$|R
50|$|The massive {{exodus of}} Palestinians from Kuwait {{began with the}} Iraqi {{invasion}} into the country in summer 1990. The exodus included both Kuwaitis and Palestinians, who were forming {{a large percentage of}} Kuwaiti residents. Out of initial 350,000 people of Palestinian descent who resided in Kuwait in mid-1990, more than 200,000 fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority</b> figures in Kuwait. The Iraqi education ministry in Kuwait fired 3,000 Palestinians in September 1990, and the dismissals of Palestinians from other sectors continued throughout October. The Iraqis also put pressure on the PLO office in Kuwait, which had refused to organize any Palestinian demonstrations and rallies in support of Iraq. The only Palestinian demonstration in Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation was actually a pro-Kuwait demonstration, with the Palestinian inhabitants of the Hawalli district waving photos of the Emir.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 split, the Jordanian branch had an {{estimated}} 1,000 members. It was active in the Arab Liberation Front (ALF); the ALF's first leader was the Jordanian, Zaid Haydar. Munif al-Razzaz, who joined the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath resistance in 1966, eventually became an ALF leader. From there, he climbed the party ladder and {{became a member of the}} National Command before he was placed under house arrest by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities.</b> Shahir Abu Shahut became the first leader of the party branch in Jordan after the 1966 split.|$|E
25|$|Omar v. Harvey {{deals with}} a {{petition}} for a writ of habeas corpus filed on behalf of Shawqi Ahmad Omar, an American citizen, captured and detained in Iraq by United States military forces operating {{as part of the}} Multi-National Force-Iraq. Omar had been held under the control of United States forces since October 2004, allegedly without legal process and with no meaningful access to counsel. When the US District Court learned of Omar's imminent transfer to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> for trial on terrorism charges, it issued a preliminary injunction barring transfer in order to preserve its jurisdiction to entertain the habeas petition.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 2004, a major {{military}} operation was launched against Tal Afar by the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team) and Iraqi Security forces. Fighting continued until September 12, 2004 {{when the government}} of Turkey claimed that the fighting had taken the lives of approximately 58 ethnic Turkmen civilians and demanded an end to military operations at which time the civilians camped outside Tal Afar were {{allowed to return to}} their homes. American forces defeated the insurgents and left about 500 troops in the city. However, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> lost control of the city in May 2005, and insurgents began taking over again.|$|E
5000|$|Abu Ayyub al-Masri, Minister of War, {{was already}} wanted by <b>Iraqi</b> and US-coalition <b>authorities</b> since 2005, and {{was killed by}} US/Iraqi forces in April 2010. He was succeeded by Abu Suleiman al-Naser.|$|R
5000|$|A third push {{was mounted}} from September 2006 and lasted until mid-January 2007. Tactics {{developed}} {{in what has}} been called the [...] "Third Battle of Fallujah," [...] when applied on a larger scale in Ramadi and the surrounding area, led to what became known as [...] "the Great Sunni Awakening." [...] After four years of bitter fighting, Fallujah was turned over to the Iraqi Forces and the <b>Iraqi</b> Provincial <b>Authority</b> during the autumn of 2007.|$|R
5000|$|As World War II {{began to}} occupy the {{attention}} of the world’s nations, the Barzanis and their tribe were still internally separated and remained at odds with the Iraqi government. The British occupation of Iraq in 1941, presumably to ensure Iraqi compliance with the Allied cause would indirectly lead to a reunion between Mustafa Barzani and his people and again pose a challenge to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority.</b> In 1943, with inflation gripping Iraq and the British showing little concern about the Kurdish issue, the Barzani family found themselves unable to subsist on their meager government funds. Still in exile in Sulaymaniya, the Barzani financial situation became so dire the family resorted to selling their rifles and their gold jewelry. The indignation of having to part with their family fortune and their methods of self-defense led Mustafa Barzani to plot his return to Barzan. [...] The impetus for Barzani’s return was strictly economic, not nationalist nor caused by a desire to counter any anti-British sentiment in Kurdistan, although Barzani did have contacts within Kurdish nationalist circles in Sulaymaniya, who may have aided him in his escape.|$|R
25|$|<b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> put Saddam {{and seven}} other former Iraqi {{officials}} on trial on 19 October 2005, {{four days after}} the 15 October 2005 referendum on the new Iraq constitution. The tribunal specifically charged the defendants with the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the failed assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. Supporters of Saddam protested against the trial in Tikrit. After the charges were read to them, all eight defendants pleaded not guilty. While initially open to the public, the trial was closed to them on 15 March 2006, after Saddam began making political statements on the stand and an argument began between him and the presiding judge.|$|E
25|$|Between 1980 and 1988, the {{conflict}} intensified as the Iran–Iraq War commenced. One {{of the groups}} targeted in particular by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> were the Feyli Kurds, a community of Shi'ite Kurds settled in the southern area of the Zagros Mountains near Iraq's border with Iran. Saddam Hussein considered the group as 'Iranians' and began a campaign to drive the settlers {{out of the area}} as a part of his 'Arabization' policy in 1980., Saddam Hussein was severely critical of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as they aligned forces with Iran in {{the conflict}}. In 1983, to avenge this liaison, he ordered the Army to abduct as many as 8,000 men and boys from Arbil province, where the clan of Barzani Kurds was based. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the clan and the KDP, himself lost 37 members of his family to the Iraqi troops. They were reported to having been sent to Nugra Salman prison in the southern deserts of Iraq, where they were tortured. Subsequently, the remains of 512 Barzani men were discovered in a mass grave. On March 16, 1988, Iraqi troops began shelling the Kurdish town of Halabja, in retaliation for an attack on Iraqi positions carried out by Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the aligned Peshmerga fighters. Subsequently, the town was attacked with a mix of chemical substances such as VX (nerve agent), sarin and mustard gas (see Halabja chemical attack). Over 5,000 people are believed to {{have been killed in the}} attack, which was considered to be a part of the Al-Anfal Campaign, directed against Kurds by the government under the command of Ali Hassan al-Majid, head of the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{group has}} claimed {{responsibility}} for over 6,000 attacks in Iraq including the October 10, 2006 attack on Camp Falcon, {{the assassination of the}} American military commander in Najaf, the May 6, 2006 downing of a British Lynx helicopter and the October 3, 2007 attack on the Polish ambassador. Their most known attack however, is the January 20, 2007 Karbala provincial headquarters raid where they infiltrated the U.S. Army's offices at Karbala, killed one soldier, then abducted and killed four more American soldiers. After the raid, the U.S. military launched a crackdown on the group and the raid's mastermind Azhar al-Dulaimi was killed in Baghdad, while much of the group's leadership including the brothers Qais and Laith al-Khazali and Lebanese Hezbollah member Ali Musa Daqduq who was Khazali's advisor was in charge of their relations with Hezbollah. After these arrests in 2007, Akram al-Kabi, who had been the military commander of the Mahdi Army until May 2007, led the organisation. In May 2007, the group kidnapped British IT expert Peter Moore and his four bodyguards. They demanded the release of all their fighters being imprisoned by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authorities</b> and US military in return for his release. His four bodyguards were killed, but Moore himself was released when the group's leader Qais al-Khazali was released in January 2010. Prior to Qazali's release, security forces had already released over 100 of the group's members including Laith al-Khazali. In 2008 many of the groups fighters and leaders fled to Iran after the Iraqi Army was allowed to re-take control of Sadr City and the Mahdi Army was disbanded. Here most fighters were re-trained in new tactics. It resulted in a major lull in the group's activity from May to July 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Garen {{spent months}} in Iraq documenting the [...] "systematic dismantling" [...] of the nation's {{cultural}} and archaeological legacy, {{according to one}} report. On August 13, 2004, {{while he was in}} a market taking photographs with a regular camera, Garen and his Iraqi translator, Amir Doshi, were kidnapped by Shia extremists and they were held hostage in Nasiriya in southern Iraq. On August 19, a video aired on al-Jazeera in which Garen appeared sitting {{on the floor in front}} of masked insurgents with weapons making demands for his release. The kidnapping story drew international media attention. During the captivity, there was a strong behind-the-scenes effort to encourage <b>Iraqi</b> <b>authority</b> figures to secure his release, partially by his partner, Marie-Helene Carleton, Garen's sister Eva Garen, as well as people within Yale University, where Garen's father is a professor. His captors eventually turned Garen and his translator over to representatives of Moqtada al-Sadr in Nasiriya, unharmed, on August 22, 2004. He said he was very thankful to the cleric and his aides for their efforts at getting him released. After being released, he said he wanted to stay in Iraq to continue with his documentary project.|$|R
