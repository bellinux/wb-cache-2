5|$|Dredd is a 2012 science-fiction action film {{directed}} by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It {{is based on}} the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).|$|E
500|$|The Apprentice Boys' parade is {{an annual}} celebration by unionists {{of the relief}} of the Siege of Derry in 1689, which began when {{thirteen}} young apprentice boys shut the city's gates against the army of King James. [...] At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year. Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bogside, and were often openly hostile to the residents. [...] On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) was formed to try to preserve peace {{during the period of}} the parade, and to defend the Bogside and Creggan {{in the event of an}} attack. [...] The chairman was Seán Keenan, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) veteran; the vice-chairman was Paddy Doherty, a popular local man sometimes known as [...] "Paddy Bogside" [...] and the secretary was Johnnie White, another leading republican and leader of the James Connolly Republican Club. [...] Street committees were formed under the overall command of the DCDA and barricades were built on the night of 11 August. [...] The parade took place as planned on 12 August. [...] As it passed through Waterloo Place, on the edge of the Bogside, hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade. Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours, then the police joined in. They charged up William Street against the Bogsiders, followed by the 'Paisleyites'. They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs. The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the Bogside. [...] Late in the evening, having been driven back repeatedly, the police fired canisters of CS gas into the crowd. [...] Youths on the roof of a <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> on Rossville Street threw petrol bombs down on the police. [...] Walkie-talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DCDA headquarters in Paddy Doherty's house in Westland Street, and first aid stations were operating, staffed by doctors, nurses and volunteers. Women and girls made milk-bottle crates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line [...] and [...] "Radio Free Derry" [...] broadcast to the fighters and their families. [...] On the third day of fighting, 14 August, the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary (B-Specials), a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere. [...] Before they engaged, however, British troops were deployed at the scene, carrying automatic rifles and sub-machine guns. The RUC and B-Specials withdrew, and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area.|$|E

5000|$|Bognor Regis {{has a large}} town centre, much {{of which}} has either been pedestrianised or made pedestrian-friendly. Since the end of World War Two the town has been subject to some piece-meal {{commercial}} redevelopment , notably in the early 1960s when a new shopping parade and road (called Queensway), a health centre and a <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were built on land just north-west of the High Street. In the three decades between 1950 and 1980 much residential development took place {{to the west and}} north of the town, since then mostly in-fill development has taken place, predominantly redeveloping land on brownfield sites that had formerly been used for commercial business.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{setting of}} the stories told by the album's setting is {{somewhat}} amorphous. The real Turnpike House is a <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in Goswell Road, EC1, an area of ex-council blocks between Clerkenwell and Upper Street. The band had {{spent a lot of}} time in Turnpike House, as filmmaker Paul Kelly lived there during the period in which they were collaborating on What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day?. However, Sarah Cracknell has said that the building imagined in the album is [...] "not nearly as smart" [...] as the real Turnpike House. Bob Stanley has said that he imagined the album's setting to be more suburban, [...] "probably somewhere like Croydon or possibly Ponders End". Pete Wiggs has said that his experience of living in Croydon was the inspiration for [...] "Side Streets" [...] and [...] "Slow Down at the Castle" [...] (the Castle is a water tower in Park Hill Recreation Ground). However, the title of [...] "The Birdman of EC1" [...] refers to the postal district in which the real Turnpike House is located.|$|E

50|$|The town {{is largely}} urban in character, with many <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> near the seafront and elsewhere. There are some narrow streets with many {{low-rise}} villas. Considerable commercial and housing development is underway further inland.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{with the}} working-class {{population}} expanding, housing estates <b>of</b> <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> {{were built in}} the centre {{as well as on the}} outskirts of the town.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{reconstruction}} of the <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the city district Brno-South. The thesis concentrates on the evaluation of the economical effectivity of this project using two ways of financing. It focuses primarily on planning of the individual finance flows of the project, which will arise in connection with the operation of the <b>high-rise</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b> The part of the thesis is also the calculation of the basic economic indicators in two ways of financing, by which is it possible to objectively assess the investment and evaluate the favourableness of the financing by own sources and financing by bank loan. In conclusion, the comparison of these two ways of financing will be performed...|$|E
50|$|Cheung Wang Estate (長宏邨) is {{situated}} in Liu To on Tsing Yi Island, Hong Kong.

50|$|In {{the years}} 1960 to 1964 Grieve was the Scottish Office's Chief Planning Officer for Scotland. An example of Grieve's searching {{questions}} was his challenge, in 1962, of Glasgow Corporation's {{plans to build}} 650 <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> within the city. The only blocks to be built were the Red Road Flats which have since been condemned.|$|R
50|$|Pendleton is a densely {{populated}} area which has several <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> (tower <b>blocks)</b> - typically between 17 and 27 storeys high - some of the tallest buildings in Salford and Greater Manchester. The area has two colleges; Pendleton College and a Salford College campus, Salford's largest shopping precinct, Salford Shopping City and Pendleton Police Station.|$|R
5000|$|Stafford possessed two <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the Highfields {{estate of}} Stafford {{up until the}} late 1990s.

The {{accommodation}} in these was seen by the University students as being sub-par and after being condemned in the mid-90s, Brooke Court was demolished and Binyon Court was sold off.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} British cities during the period. The 1950s and 1960s saw {{extensive}} re-development of the city, with old and overcrowded housing cleared {{to make way}} for <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b> This changed the appearance of Manchester considerably, although the high-rise experiment later proved unpopular and unsuccessful. The city-centre also saw major re-development, with developments such as the Manchester Arndale.|$|R
50|$|In 1774 {{the blast}} {{furnaces}} {{in the area}} were abandoned and the mansion house pulled down. The area reverted to agricultural land until the 1950s, when it was developed as the main residential area of Jesenice during the industrial expansion of the Jesenice ironworks after the Second World War, particularly in the 1970s when rows <b>of</b> <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} era, hermitages are often abutted to monasteries, or located on their grounds, being {{occupied}} by monks who receive dispensation from their abbot or prior {{to live a}} semi-solitary life. However, hermitages {{can be found in}} a variety of settings, from isolated rural locations, houses in large cities, and even <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats,</b> depending on the hermit's means.|$|R
50|$|Lyng was {{developed}} during the 19th century due to the Industrial Revolution that bought thousands of jobs to the local area. Hundreds of houses were built, but after the Second World War many of these homes were becoming unfit for human habitation. This resulted in extensive demolition work during the 1960s that saw the old homes replaced with new council-owned properties including several <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 1950s, the Swarcliffe {{housing estate}} was {{developed}} by the city council which built two and three-bedroomed semi-detached council houses, a number <b>of</b> three-storey <b>blocks</b> containing 12flats or more, and three brick-built nine-storey <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b> Two <b>of</b> the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were demolished in the 1990s and an old people's home was built on the site. In 2007, the remaining block was demolished. The previous year, six <b>of</b> seven fifteen-storey <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats,</b> built in 1966 as part of the Whinmoor estate, were demolished.|$|R
50|$|In the {{immediate}} postwar years housing {{was a major}} issue in London, due to the large amount of housing which had been destroyed in the war. The authorities decided upon <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> as the answer to housing shortages. During the 1950s and 1960s the skyline of London altered dramatically as tower blocks were erected, although these later proved unpopular. In a bid {{to reduce the number of}} people living in overcrowded housing, a policy was introduced of encouraging people to move into newly built new towns surrounding London.|$|R
50|$|Tsing Yi Estate (Chinese: 青衣邨) is {{the only}} public housing estate on Tsing Yi Island which name does not start with the {{character}} Cheung (長). This {{is due to the}} fact that the estate was named in the memory of Tsing Yi Town (青衣墟), a traditional market town which was demolished in the 1980s to make way for new town developments. Since the estate was situated at the seaside of old Tsing Yi Town, part of it is built on reclaimed land. The estate consists <b>of</b> four <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, two <b>of</b> Netherfields' three <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were demolished, after {{a lengthy}} {{consultation}} with Netherfields' residents. The flats, which were built in 1968, each contained 90 flats. Concerns from residents indicated problems within each <b>of</b> the <b>blocks,</b> which experienced high levels of anti-social behaviour and were becoming increasingly difficult to let. The demolition {{was carried out by}} the use of explosives, and provided a spectacle for those who came to watch. After the demolition, Erimus Housing made improvements to the remaining <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats,</b> Welton House, which included new kitchens, bathrooms, rewiring and new double glazed units.|$|R
25|$|There are {{estimated}} to be about 600 <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the UK that have similar cladding and unspecified fire safety tests have been carried out on panels sent in by councils at the Building Research Establishment in Watford, on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. By 28 June 2017, 120 high-rise buildings in 37 different local authority areas were reported to have failed fire safety tests, a 100% failure rate of samples tested. Councils had been instructed to begin with those buildings that caused the most concern, and every single one of those had failed the test.|$|R
50|$|Cheung On Estate (Chinese: 長安邨) is {{situated}} in Area 8 of Tsing Yi Island, built on the reclaimed land in Tsing Yi North. The estate consists <b>of</b> ten <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats.</b> Among 7338 flats in the estate, 5617 flats have been sold to the residents under the TPS since January 1998. Cheung On Estate was {{the one of the}} first few estates to be sold under the above scheme. The remaining 1721 flats are remained as the public housing, which 1600 households are living in. According to the census taken in 2001, the total population of the estate is 28,278.|$|R
50|$|The Commission {{presided over}} the {{construction}} of the Melbourne Olympic Village in 1956, and made its mark on the Melbourne skyline during the 1960s in the form <b>of</b> <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> on various sites around inner Melbourne, the largest of which being Lygon Street in Carlton and Atherton Gardens in Fitzroy. Approximately twenty of these precast concrete 20 to 30 storey height buildings were constructed around Melbourne, until the type of development fell into disrepute, mainly for sociological reasons. By 1970 nearly 4000 privately owned dwellings had been compulsory acquired and replaced by nearly 7000 high rise flats.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{estimated}} to be about 600 <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the UK that have similar cladding and unspecified fire safety tests have been carried out on panels sent in by councils at the Building Research Establishment in Watford, on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

25|$|Langbar Towers, {{next to a}} {{shopping}} parade, {{was the first of}} five 15-storey H-plan tower blocks to be completed at Whinmoor. The high rise blocks had reinforced concrete frames with no-fines concrete infill panels. The planning application was approved in 1964 and the first block, Langbar Towers, completed on 24 January 1966 was officially opened on 19 February 1966 by Denis Healey MP. Ash Tree Court, Brayton Grange, Farndale Court, Langbar Grange, Langbar Towers and Pennwell Croft, six <b>of</b> seven <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> built in1966, were demolished in2006. Sherburn Court, the remaining <b>high-rise</b> <b>block,</b> was refurbished and given a new roof, windows and lifts.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} of the Second World War, St Francis Xavier's was the largest Roman Catholic parish in England, {{containing}} over 13,000 Catholics. During the war the church was damaged, particularly the roof, and most of the windows were blown out. From the 1960s the Church went into decline, mainly due to the demolition of housing in the parish and the relocation {{of the majority of the}} parishioners to other parts of the city. At that time several <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> were erected in the neighbourhood, but soon vandalised and ultimately demolished. For many years the area around the church was left empty and neglected. Slowly low density housing was built in Everton, mainly occupied by non-church attenders.|$|R
50|$|By the 1990s, {{the area}} had a diverse social mix, with churches from three {{different}} denominations nearby. The local buildings comprised a mixture of Victorian terraces and villas, with <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> from the 1960s and later, and the development at Canary Wharf was visible in the distance. The area {{was in the middle}} of an extensive redevelopment, and the local authorities decided to demolish the terrace to create a new park beside Roman Road and Grove Road. Sid Gale, the last residential occupier of 193 Grove Road, opposed its demolition, and continued to live in the house while the remainder of the terrace was demolished, leaving his house and the ones to either side, but he was eventually persuaded to move out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the Grenfell Tower fire in London, and similar fires in France, Dubai, and elsewhere, great {{attention}} has been paid to the fire protection qualities of cladding used in tower-blocks and similar high-rise multiple-occupancy housing and, in particular, the use of aluminium composite material (ACM) and ACM panels (ACP). Grenfell Tower was clad with composite panels with a polyethylene core which is thought to have contributed to the fire; these panels cost about £2 less than ones with incombustible core. There are estimated to be about 600 <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> in the UK that have [...] "similar" [...] cladding and some fire safety tests—not full BS 8414 tests—were carried out on panels; of the first 75 tested, 100% failed.|$|R
500|$|By 1980, 75% of the {{residents}} in Singapore were living in public housing. [...] Government-built <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> clustered in the population centres, of which Toa Payoh was typical. [...] Although a high density of people lived in each block, {{the residents}} mostly kept to themselves, valuing their privacy and tending to ignore what was happening around their homes. [...] During this time, Singapore was a relatively peaceful societya {{stark contrast to the}} prevalence of secret societies, triads and gang warfare during the pre-independence days. [...] The low crime rate, brought on by strict laws and tough enforcement, gave citizens a sense of security. Nonetheless, the government warned against complacency and lectured in its local campaigns, [...] "Low crime doesn't mean no crime". [...] In 1981, three Singaporeans committed a crime that shocked the nation.|$|R
25|$|Modernisation of {{the city}} centre {{continued}} in the post-war period. The mediaeval Overgate was demolished in the early 1960s {{to make way for}} a shopping centre, followed by construction of the inner ring road and the Wellgate Shopping Centre. The Tay Road Bridge, completed in 1966 had as its northern landfall the docklands of central Dundee, and the new associated road system resulted in the city centre being cut off from the river. An acute shortage of housing in the late 1940s was addressed by a series of large housing estates built in the northern environs including the Fintry, Craigie, Charleston and Douglas areas in the 1950s and early 1960s. These were followed by increasingly cost-effective and sometimes poorly planned housing in throughout the 1960s. Much of this, in particular the <b>high-rise</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flats</b> at Lochee, Kirkton, Trottick, Whitfield, Ardler and Menzieshill, and the prefabricated Skarne housing blocks at Whitfield, have been demolished since the 1990s or are scheduled for future demolition.|$|R
