5|$|D. Michael Harris and Jack Grimm {{had failed}} to find Titanic but their expeditions did succeed in {{producing}} fairly detailed mapping of {{the area in which}} the ship had sunk. It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had not given up hope and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes,</b> it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E

25|$|The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) prohibits {{commercial}} whaling {{south of}} 40 degrees south (south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and 130 degrees west).

Since {{the scope of the}} sanctuary is limited to commercial whaling, in regard to its whaling permit and whaling for scientific research, a Japanese fleet carried out an annual whale-hunt in the region. On 31 March 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan's whaling program, which Japan has long claimed is <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes,</b> was a cloak for commercial whaling, and no further permits would be granted.|$|E

25|$|Some {{recreational}} fishing groups are also promoting a catch and release {{practice for the}} giant trevally, with this becoming an increasingly popular option for charter boat operators, who have also begun to tag giant trevally <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes.</b> At large sizes, the species {{is more likely to}} be ciguatoxic, so if the fish is kept, it must be disposed of or sent to a taxidermist if it is a trophy fish. A catch and release approach has also been adopted by operators outside of Hawaii, with Australian operators who target the species by popping and jigging rarely keeping any fish. Careful fish handling techniques have also been implemented by anglers so as not to damage the fish; such techniques include supporting the fish's weight, using barbless single, rather than treble, hooks and restricting the time the fish spends out the water to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes,</b> in {{opposition}} to Catastrophism. Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} sailing season, the ships carried cargo along the Northern Sea Route, {{supplying}} the settlements and mining colonies on the East Siberian coast, and made several transit voyages from Europe to the Far East and Canada, each 25-day voyage taking around ten days {{less than a}} similar voyage through the Suez Canal. In winter the SA-15 class freighters mainly supported the Norilsk-Dudinka operation, providing a continuous flow of non-ferrous metal concentrates to the smelters of the Kola Peninsula and other industries within the Soviet Union, but also carried other cargo especially when the ice conditions became too difficult for other vessels. In 1990, Norilsk became the first ship to transport cargo from Japan to Europe via the Northern Sea Route. To promote the utilization of the Northern Sea Route, cargo space on board the SA-15 class ships was also leased to Western shipping companies and several experimental voyages <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes</b> {{were made in the}} 1990s. For years the SA-15 class ships formed the core of the Soviet and later Russian fleet of icebreaking cargo ships.|$|E

25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was {{established}} by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. On 11 February 1992, the Convention was signed by Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, and took effect on 16 February 1993. The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of anadromous species and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the Convention Area. The Convention prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the Convention Area, but allows for some fishing of these species <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes</b> under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC. The Convention also includes measures to reduce incidental catch of anadromous fish in other high seas fisheries and prohibits the retention of these species on board fishing vessels in the Convention Area.|$|E
25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes</b> in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E
25|$|The Lumière Brothers {{had given}} the first {{projected}} showing of a motion picture, La Sortie de l'usine Lumière, at the Salon Indien du Grand Café of the Hôtel Scribe on the Boulevard des Capucines, on 28 December 1895. A young French entrepreneur, Georges Méliés, attended the first showing and asked the Lumière brothers for a iicense to make films. The Lumière Brothers politely declined, telling him that the cinema was <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes</b> and had no commercial value. Méliés persisted and established his own small studio in 1897 in Montreuil, just east of Paris. He became a producer, director, scenarist, set designer and actor, and made hundreds of short films, including the first science-fiction film, A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans la Lune), in 1902. Another French cinema pioneer and producer Charles Pathé, also built a studio in Montreuil, then moved to the Rue des Vignerons in Vincennes, east of Paris. His chief rival in the early French film industry, Léon Gaumont, opened his first studio {{at about the same}} time at the Rue des Alouettes in the 19th arrondissement, near the Buttes-Chaumont.|$|E

Besides, their work did not concern only a closed and restricted circle of specialists and academics. It was addressed to the society of their times, in order to strengthen their national self-knowledge. Besides, Paparrigopoulos' classes at the University, which constituted the raw material for the writing of his memorable History, were frequently published in Pandora magazine, of which he was the co-publisher, {{as well as in the}} Athenian Press. The term Greek-Christian which was devised <b>for</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>purposes,</b> functioned towards the same direction but did not remain a simple instrument of analysis in the hands of specialists. As this term appeared in mid-ninth century exactly, it became a canvass on which the ideology of the Greek state was developed and shaped. The content of education, the orientation of historical studies and the study of tradition (folklore) were organized on this basis. In addition, the Megali Idea (Greek Great Idea) which was nebulous until that time, acquired flesh and bones. The Byzantine Empire, which had now been acclaimed a cultural mold of the Greek state which was still small, became the model for its territorial expansion.|$|E
