30|$|If {{the pulse}} induces {{adiabatic}} dynamics, it shifts the qubit and cavity levels proportionally to ϵ(t)^ 2 / Δ where Δ is the detuning from the respective level [32]. In the original field-free frame, this {{is equivalent to}} shifting the initial wave packet proportionally to {{the square of the}} pulse. Thus, the excitation and population dynamics should smoothly follow the pulse shape. Specifically, the condition for adiabaticity is that if the pulse shape were to be stretched in time, the population dynamics would simply stretch correspondingly. For a given peak amplitude, the larger the detuning of the drive ω_d from the frequencies ω_c, ω_ 2, ω_ 1, the smaller the excitation in the respective Hilbert space. Since the drive is detuned by only 40 MHz from the cavity, the cavity <b>excitation,</b> <b>panel</b> (a), reaches a large value 〈 n 〉≈ 30. The far-detuned right qubit, panel (b), and even farther detuned left qubit, panel (c), only show a small excitation. As indicated by the standard deviations shown as shaded areas in panels (a)-(c), the excitation remains relatively localized in energy. It is noteworthy, however, that the excitation curves (specifically of the cavity) show some imperfections. These ‘wobbles’ can be interpreted as deviations from the expected adiabatic dynamics, e.g. jumping over an avoided crossing between highly excited cavity states. This ultimately results in a small loss of population from the logical subspace, as the system does not perfectly return to its original state. The loss of population for the given example is ε _pop= 5.9 × 10 ^- 3. While such a small deviation is not discernible in the plot of the population in panel (d), it is nonetheless a significant error in the objective of obtaining high fidelity gates below the quantum error correction limit, typically resulting in gate errors below 10 − 3. In principle, cavity population can be suppressed by tuning the qubit parameters and using non-trivial pulse shapes [32].|$|E

One is the averaging over the receiver components (left panel), {{and the other is}} the averaging over the source <b>excitations</b> (right <b>panel).</b> As explained in the ‘First signal test’ section, the transfer function for each station has six components, which is the combination of two components for the source excitations and three components for the receiver. The panel on the left shows the mean amplitude of three components at receivers for transverse and radial excitations of the source. The mean amplitudes for the single sinusoid operation at 10.01  Hz are labeled 10.01  t and 10.01 r for transverse and radial excitations, respectively. Those of the FM operations are labeled FM t and FM r. There is no systematic difference in the mean amplitude between transverse and radial <b>excitations.</b> The <b>panel</b> on the right shows the amplitudes of transverse and radial components of the horizontal motions at receivers averaged over two excitation components of the source.

Extensive damage to the power & control cables and bus ducts took place during this accident. The vertical aluminum ducting above the neutral transformer has completely melted The ducts ending near the <b>excitation</b> <b>panels</b> had been shattered. All the panels of AVR, Field Breaker & thyristor cubicles were completely damaged in the fire. Mechanical failures include fatigue fracture of Blades of the turbine. [1]In this project work, we have analyzed the narora fire accident and performed a root cause analysis and suggest the various alterations which can help prevent such accidents in future. In this paper I have analyzed in depth about the fire accident that {{took place in a}} nuclear power plant at Narora using the Root-Cause method and Top-Bottom analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a recent programme of research, which has {{concentrated on the}} measurement and prediction of the dynamic response of doubly curved composite honeycomb sandwich panels to high intensity, random acoustic <b>excitation.</b> Four <b>panels</b> with varying radii of curvature were tested in a progressive wave tube (PWT) facility at overall sound pressure levels up to 164 dB (re 2 × 10 ? 5 Pa). Several methods are presented to predict the dynamic response of the panels to random acoustic excitation. The first of these was the single-degree-of freedom (SDOF) approximation method, where different assumptions {{with regard to the}} spatial characteristics of the pressure loading are made. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also used to predict the response, where the pressure loading was assumed to consist of a series of travelling waves at grazing incidence to the structure. The results presented for both the SDOF approximation method and the FEA method show good agreement between predicted and measured strain values, which are also presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{with the design}} of an acoustic cavity (transmission suite) for the vibro-acoustic characterization of lightweight panels. This setup has the big advantage of being a small (1150 x 984 x 820 mm) which allows {{the identification of the}} studied behaviour for both structure- and air- borne <b>excitation,</b> on <b>panels</b> of different size (from A 4 to A 2) and thickness (up to 5 cm). Particular effort is made for selecting an optimum geometric configuration. Taking into account the acoustic eigenfrequencies’ occurrences up to the Schroeder frequency and considering the surface averaged sound absorption coefficient (α) this design leads to the smoothest and most uniform distribution of the natural frequencies of the acoustic cavity. The final design results in a non-parallel walled concrete box of moderate dimensions. Specific care is taken for the implementation and building of the test setup. The resulting facility allows the identification of both structure-borne and air-borne acoustic isolation parameters in lightweight panels of different size. ...|$|R

40|$|In-flight {{measurements}} and wind tunnel measurements of pressure fluctuations underneath a {{turbulent boundary layer}} were conducted. The characteristics of turbulent structures in the boundary layer is important for determination of the <b>excitation</b> of aircraft <b>panels</b> and therefore for the generation of cabin noise. A transient pressure transducer array was used in a flight test {{in order to obtain}} properties of the boundary layer concerning the turbulent excitation of aircraft hull at full scale. The array was designed to distinguish between acoustical and convective waves by means of frequency and wavenumber. Another feature of the array was the ability to extract the direction of flow directly out of the transducer phase data. The consideration of flow direction is important when investigating the convective transport of coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer. Using the present array, the alignment of the transducers with the flow is not necessary. A similar array was used in wind tunnel tests at equal conditions...|$|R
3000|$|For {{the present}} example, {{we use the}} final pulse of the {{previous}} section {{as the starting point}} of an optimization with Krotov’s method. Since now the guess pulse already has a relatively high fidelity, both the J_T^sm and J_T^geo functionals may be used interchangeably, as we are only searching in a very small vicinity of the starting point. Both methods converge rapidly to Δ J_T/J_T < 10 ^- 4 in under 200 iterations. The dynamics resulting from the propagation of the [...] 00 〉 state under the pulse obtained from optimization with the J_T^sm functional is shown in panels (e)-(h) of Figure  3. The comparison to the dynamics of the pre-optimized guess pulse in panels (a)-(d) is striking: the excitations now follow the pulse shape smoothly. The non-adiabatic defects, i.e., the wobbles especially in the cavity <b>excitation</b> in <b>panel</b> (a), have been corrected. Consequently, the loss of population from the logical subspace is now reduced to a value of ε _pop= 1.1 × 10 ^- 5. Together with only a slight increase in the concurrence error to ε _C= 5.1 × 10 ^- 5, the overall gate error of the optimized pulse is ε _avg= 3.4 × 10 ^- 5. This is an improvement of half an order of magnitude compared to the direct optimization in Section  3.2. Moreover, the result has been obtained at {{a small fraction of the}} numerical cost. The pre-optimized guess and post-optimized pulse shape, indicated as the blue shaded area in panels (d) and (h), appear visually indistinguishable.|$|R
40|$|International audienceExperiments to {{simulate}} the flow induced vibration and noise radiation from a car window are described. Two cases are considered: flow over a backwards-facing step and flow over a half-cylinder placed on a flat plate. The first configuration represents the flow separation and subsequent flow re-attachment into a turbulent boundary layer generated by the A-pillar of a car. The second configuration {{is representative of the}} turbulent flow over a side window produced by a car wing mirror. Measurements were carried out in an open jet anechoic wind tunnel at ISVR, where a very low noise flow of up to 40 m/s can be achieved. Wall pressure fluctuations were measured using a streamwise array of microphones, from which the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the pressure fluctuations was obtained. The vibrational response of the test panel was measured on a grid of points and noise radiation was measured using sound intensity mapping and a fixed microphone in the acoustic far-field. The data are analysed to determine the relative importance of acoustic and convective <b>excitation</b> of the <b>panel...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} response and radiation from an acoustically loaded aircraft panel is presented. In the experiment, the panel is excited by a normally incident, harmonic wave. Measurements of the panel response and the resulting transmitted pressure are made in both the near- and acoustic far-fields. The numerical computations model the experiment and in particular account for the full coupling between the panel and the surrounding three dimensional acoustic fluid. The results demonstrate that for a sufficiently high <b>excitation</b> level, the <b>panel</b> response becomes nonlinear. The nonlinearity {{is characterized by the}} appearance of harmonics and subharmonics in the power spectral densities of the panel motion and consequently in the resulting acoustic radiation. The primary characteristic of the far-field acoustic radiation is the increase in harmonic content relative to the fundamental and subharmonics with increasing distance from the panel. This is shown to be a result of linear and weakly nonlinear wave propagation effects. The numerical results show that the radiated far-field pressure is strongly dependent on the position of the measurement point with respect to the panel center. The {{experimental and}} numerical results are in good qualitative agreement...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{structural}} interaction {{problems that}} estimate panel vibration from an applied pressure field excitation are quite {{dependent on the}} spatial correlation of the pressure field. There is a danger of either over estimating a low frequency response or under predicting broad band panel response in the more modally dense bands if the pressure field spatial correlation is not accounted for adequately. Even when the analyst elects to use a fitted function for the spatial correlation an error may be introduced if the choice of patch density is not fine enough to represent the more continuous spatial correlation function throughout the intended frequency range of interest. Both qualitative and quantitative illustrations evaluating the adequacy of different patch density assumptions to approximate the fitted spatial correlation function are provided. The actual response of a typical vehicle panel system is then evaluated in a convergence study where the patch density assumptions are varied over the same finite element model.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for the measurement of dynamic strains in complex composite structures. The particular structure {{used in this study}} is an integrally stiffened composite panel for which the stiffeners and skin are fabricated in a single layup and cure process. Surface-mounted FBG sensors are bonded to the panels after curing, whereas embedded FBG sensors are successfully incorporated during the fabrication process. A finite element model was also constructed of the stiffened panel. The panels were subjected to repeated impacts and the post-impact vibration response of the panel was measured through the FBG sensor responses. Little change to the global response of the panel was observed after the repeated impacts, through the dynamic response of the surface-mounted FBGs. Pulsed phase thermography and micro-computer-tomography imaging of the panel confirmed that the damage was localized near the impact locations, producing negligible changes to the global response of the panel. All of the embedded FBG sensors survived the fabrication and multiple impacts; however, as these were embedded close to the neutral axis of the panel, they were not very sensitive to the vibration modes. <b>Excitation</b> of the <b>panel</b> near the first natural frequency did produce a measurable response in the FBG sensors, confirming their functionality...|$|R

40|$|Producing fluid {{structural}} interaction {{estimates of}} panel vibration from an applied pressure field excitation are quite {{dependent on the}} spatial correlation of the pressure field. There is a danger of either over estimating a low frequency response or under predicting broad band panel response in the more modally dense bands if the pressure field spatial correlation is not accounted for adequately. It is a useful practice to simulate the spatial correlation of the applied pressure field over a 2 d surface using a matrix of small patch area regions on a finite element model (FEM). Use of a fitted function for the spatial correlation between patch centers can result in an error if the choice of patch density is not fine enough to represent the more continuous spatial correlation function throughout the intended frequency range of interest. Several patch density assumptions to approximate the fitted spatial correlation function are first evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative illustrations. The actual response of a typical vehicle panel system FEM is then examined in a convergence study where the patch density assumptions are varied over the same model.

40|$|This work is {{intended}} to apprehend which door vibrations contribute to the visible motion occuring during closure,where they emanate from and how they may be abolished. The human ability to distinguish mechanical vibrations is not well-known and should be experimentally investigated. On account on its inertia, the eye perception weakens over frequency and, in particular, no dynamic motion can be discerned over 50 Hz. This determines the upper frequency limit of visibility and rejects the currently assumed value 10 Hz higher. Below 50 Hz, mechanical vibrations may be visible {{as long as their}} amplitude is larger than an experimentally-defined threshold. The frequency domain of interests is deep. During the closure process, the main excitation arises from the water strips that brake the door and transmit energy into inner panels. The resulting vibrations travel towards outer panels because of the strong coupling between the both. Provided that the door natural properties that are likely to be excited from the closure process do not appear below 50 Hz, no external vibrations will be distinguished. Inner panels act as transfer systems between <b>excitation</b> and outer <b>panels,</b> thus their construction must be specifically emphasised. As a rule the current structures are not stiff enough,in particular inner door panels that {{turn out to be a}} source of weakness. Practical ways to improve the construction are discussed and must be further investigated, for instance using FEM calculations, of which consistence is assessed in this work...|$|R
40|$|There {{is not a}} {{complete}} understanding of how damage mechanisms in composite materials react to nondestructive testing inputs. A deeper understanding of composite damage mechanisms and their responses to external vibratory excitation is sought using nonlinear modeling of damping and stiffness characteristics related to the damage. Different types of damping and stiffness single degree-of-freedom models are presented with analysis of their behavior at specific harmonics of the primary resonance of the system. After {{an understanding of the}} approximate behaviors of the models is obtained, experimental tests on a damaged specimen are conducted. An aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel is damaged by applying a heat source to the top face sheet. The expansion of the heated area on the face sheet creates a disbond of the face sheet and the honeycomb core. This damaged panel is tested by exciting the damaged area with a shaker at known frequencies and amplitudes. The resulting responses of the panel are measured and compared with the nonlinear predictive models through a direct comparison of response amplitudes to the analytical solutions and by examination of restoring force curves. The disbonded aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel exhibited behavior similar to a pure quadratic stiffness as well as a smaller influence from a cubic stiffness. The quadratic stiffness {{is the result of the}} facesheet experiencing two distinct stiffness regimes, the first as the facesheet moves away from the core, and second as the facesheet presses into the core. The smaller cubic nonlinearity is thought to come from the additional stiffness imparted into the single degree-of-freedom system by the epoxy fillets that hold the facesheet to the core. As the face sheet vibrates, the epoxy fillets contribute a small additional stiffening as the displacement grows larger. It is also confirmed that the displacement of the damaged area is able to be modeled using single degree-of-freedom models. This enabled the use of single degree-of-freedom equations of motion, which simplified the nonlinear analysis. Two further observations are made with regard to potential damage detection applications. First, that lower frequency <b>excitation</b> of <b>panels</b> may be able to excite the damaged areas more easily for nonlinear measurements than higher frequency excitation. This is supported by the nonlinear analysis showing that additional response peaks are more readily obtained through superharmonic excitation than subharmonic excitation. Second, that smaller damage sizes have higher quadratic and cubic stiffness coefficients, which produced relatively larger responses at the primary resonance when excited at the superharmonic frequencies than the larger damage sizes. These relatively larger responses may be a key in decreasing the size of damage detectable using vibratory excitation. ...|$|R
40|$|The finite and {{boundary}} element {{modeling of}} the curved {{section of a}} composite honeycomb aircraft fuselage sidewall was validated for both structural response and acoustic radiation. The curved panel was modeled in the pre-processor MSC/PATRAN. Geometry models of the curved panel were constructed based on the physical dimensions of the test article. Material properties {{were obtained from the}} panel manufacturer. Finite element models were developed to predict the modal parameters for free and supported panel boundary conditions up to a frequency of 600 Hz. Free boundary conditions were simulated by providing soft foam support under the four comers of the panel or by suspending the panel from elastic bands. Supported boundary conditions were obtained by clamping the panel between plastic tubing seated in grooves along the perimeter of a stiff and heavy frame. The frame was installed in the transmission loss window of the Structural Acoustic Loads and Transmission (SALT) facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The structural response of the curved panel due to point force excitation was predicted using MSC/NASTRAN and the radiated sound was computed with COMET/Acoustics. The predictions were compared with the results from experimental modal surveys and forced response tests on the fuselage panel. The finite element models were refined and updated to provide optimum comparison with the measured modal data. Excellent agreement was obtained between the numerical and experimental modal data for the free {{as well as for the}} supported boundary conditions. Frequency response functions (FRF) were computed relating the input force <b>excitation</b> at one <b>panel</b> location to the surface acceleration response at five panel locations. Frequency response functions were measured at the same locations on the test specimen and were compared with the calculated FRF values.

The validated finite element model was used to predict the surface velocities due to the point force excitation. Good agreement was obtained between the spatial characteristics of the predicted and measured surface velocities.
