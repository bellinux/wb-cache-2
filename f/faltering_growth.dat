Introduction: <b>Growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in Indonesian infant {{started when}} they are less than six month old and {{continued}} untill they grow up. Child care including feeding pattern may as aa caused this problem.  The main factors related with <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> are unbalanced food consumption (macro and micro nutrient) and infectious disease. Objectives: The study was aimed to assess the contribution of infant care to infant <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> before they reach age of nine month old. The study was designed as cohort prospective Fifty-nine babies were followed from birth until nine months old, in Sukaraja Subdistrict, Bogor Regency. Child care aspects being monitored were feeding pattern, nutrition comsumption and health care. Infant growth measured by weight and length gain, based on CDC-NCHS 2000 growth curve. Repeated measured analysis were used to evaluate when <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> begins. Multiple linier regressions were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of child care on infant growth. Result: The result of the study showed that child care significantly contribute infant weight gain and lenght gain when birth weight, birth length, frequency of infection, sex, age of mother, education of mother, nutrition and health knowledge of mother and ratio food to total expenditure were controlled. <b>Growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in weight due to child care starts when they reach two mothers old, and continue until nine months old. <b>Growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in length due to child care starts when they reach five months old, and continue until they the age reach nine months.

30|$|<b>Faltering</b> <b>growth</b> is {{a dynamic}} {{nutritional}} assessment recommended by Mehta et al. [5], but is rarely reported in the literature.

These <b>faltering</b> <b>growth</b> and weight loss rates prior to PICU admission found in our study, are much lower than reported by Valla et al. [22] of 4.8 % and 13.7 %, respectively. This difference may be attributable to the single center design of the Valla et al. study (with potentially different population recruitment), or the less restrictive definition of growth faltering (weight-for-age curve presenting a deceleration of[*]>[*]−[*] 1 z-score in the previous 3  months).

Main concern regarding this {{recommendation is}}, whether EBF supports rapidly growing infant with adequate nutrition. Methods: A cohort of randomly selected new-borns was followed up at two, four and six months, to study feeding pattern and physical growth. Feeding practices and socio-demographic data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Weight & length were measured using standard techniques. Results: EBF rates were very high in this cohort of children. One main reason to stop EBF was <b>growth</b> <b>faltering.</b> Only some children showed a catch up growth by stopping EBF. At two, four and six months, weight faltering rates among EBF babies were, 11. 1 %, 20. 1 % and 13. 2 % respectively. Length faltering had a similar pattern, but with a higher rate at all ages.

Background Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is defined as the effortless regurgitation of gastric contents into the oesophagus. GORD is defined as GOR associated with sequelae (table 1) including <b>faltering</b> <b>growth.</b> 2 View this table: * In this window * In a new window Table 1 Symptoms associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease Physiological reflux is common in both primary and secondary care settings, and usually improves with age. 3 Improvement is due to a combination of factors including growth in the length of the oesophagus, a more upright posture, increased tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter, and a more solid diet. In most cases, diagnosis is based on clinical assessment without the need for invasive testing. Investigation is reserved for those children in whom, for example, there is doubt about the diagnosis, or empirical therapy {{is considered to}} have failed, or for those children with extra-intestinal manifestations, such as acute life threatening events (ALTEs), apnoeas, Sandifer syndrome, asthma or <b>faltering</b> <b>growth,</b> in whom reflux is suspected to be a contributing factor. In children with co-existing problems, such as asthma, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or congenital heart disease, GORD may be part of a complex interaction of pathologies as a primary or secondary phenomena. In such settings children may benefit from the diagnosis and treatment of GORD, and GORD may be improved by optimal treatment of the child’s co-existing problems. Children with isolated GORD can remain symptomatic into adulthood; severe oesophagitis 4 and oesophageal strictures from GORD in childhood have been reported. 5 <br/...|$|E

Little {{is known about the}} quality of infant care provided by remote health services. This study describes the adherence to infant guidelines for anaemia and <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> by remote health staff and barriers to effective service delivery in remote settings. Methods A mixed method study drew data from 24 semi-structured interviews with clinicians working in two remote communities in northern Australia and a retrospective cohort study of Aboriginal infants from these communities, born 2004 – 2006 (n[*]=[*] 398). Medical records from remote health centres were audited. The main outcome measures were the period prevalence of infants with anaemia and <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> and management of these conditions according to local guidelines. Qualitative data assessed clinicians’ perspectives on barriers to effective remote health service delivery. Results Data from 398 health centre records were analysed. Sixty eight percent of infants were anaemic between six and twelve months of age and 42 % had documented <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> by one year. Analysis of the growth data by the authors however found 86 % of infants experienced <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> over 12 months. Clinical management and treatment completion was poor for both conditions. High staff turnover, fragmented models of care and staff poorly prepared for their role were barriers perceived by clinicians’ to impact upon the quality of service delivery. Conclusion Among Aboriginal infants in northern Australia, malnutrition and anaemia are common and occur early. Diagnosis of <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> and clinicians’ adherence to management guidelines for both conditions was poor. Antiquated service delivery models, organisation of staff and rapid staff turnover contributed to poor quality of care.

The body length and weight of 400 healthy babies attending the well-baby care clinic of King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were measured at various determined ages in a cross-sectional study design. Nutritional indicators were calculated and the proportions with low beight-for-age, low weight-for-height and low weight-for-age were compared with the reference population. The results showed a prevalence of 2 per cent of wasted children and 18 per cent of children with stunted growth. A univariate and multivariate analysis of personal and nutritional variables with the standard nutritional indicators identified age, sex, bottle feeding, and type of solid foods as significant risk factors for stunted growth.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} what preventive models or programs {{are most likely}} to improve patterns of <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in children aged under 5 years in remote Australian Indigenous communities. Methods: Nine electronic databases and the websites of key stakeholder, government and non-government agencies were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and for study quality. All types of study design were eligible. Results: 140 studies assessing a diverse range of interventions were identified. Of these, 51 articles referring to 44 individual programs and 7 review articles met the review criteria. The evidence for the effectiveness of many interventions to prevent <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> is not strong, and any observed effects are modest. Community-based nutrition education/counselling and multifaceted interventions involving carers, community health workers and community representatives, designed to meet program best-practice requirements and address the underlying causes of <b>growth</b> <b>faltering,</b> may be effective in preventing <b>growth</b> <b>faltering.</b> Other interventions, such as food distribution programs, growth monitoring, micronutrient supplementation and deworming should only be considered in the context of broader primary health care programs and/or when there is an identified local need. Conclusion: For remote Indigenous communities, development and implementation of programs should involve a consideration of the evidence for potential impact, strength of community support and local feasibility. Given the lack of strong evidence supporting programs, any new or existing programs require ongoing evaluation and refinement. Elizabeth L. McDonald, Ross S. Bailie, Alice R. Rumbold, Peter S.

40|$|Background: <b>Growth</b> <b>faltering</b> remains {{common in}} {{children}} in sub-Saharan Africa and {{is associated with}} substantial morbidity and mortality. Due to a very slow decline in the prevalence of stunting, {{the total number of}} children with stunting continues to rise in sub-Saharan Africa. Identification of effective interventions remains a challenge. Methods: We analysed the effect of 36 years of intensive health interventions on growth in infants and young children from three rural Gambian villages. Routine growth data from birth to age 2 years were available for 3659 children between 1976 and 2012. Z scores for weight-for-age, length-for-age, weight-for-length, mid-upper-arm circumference, and head circumference were calculated using the WHO 2006 growth standards. Seasonal patterns of mean Z scores were obtained by Fourier regression. We additionally defined <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> as fall in Z score between 3 months and 21 months of age. Findings: We noted secular improvements in all postnatal growth parameters (except weight-for-length), accompanied by declines over time in seasonal variability. The proportion of children with underweight or stunting at 2 years of age halved during four decades of the study period, from 38 · 7 % (95 % CI 33 · 5 – 44 · 0) for underweight and 57 · 1 % (51 · 9 – 62 · 4) for stunting. However, despite unprecedented levels of intervention, postnatal <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> persisted, leading to poor nutritional status at 24 months (length-for-age Z score − 1 · 36, 95 % CI − 1 · 44 to − 1 · 27, weight-for-age Z score − 1 · 20, − 1 · 28 to − 1 · 11, and head circumference Z score − 0 · 51, − 0 · 59 to − 0 · 43). The prevalence of stunting and underweight remained unacceptably high (30 · 0 %, 95 % CI 27 · 0 – 33 · 0, for stunting and 22 · 1 %, 19 · 4 to 24 · 8, for underweight). Interpretation: A combination of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions has achieved a halving of undernutrition rates, but despite these intensive interventions substantial <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> remains. We need to understand the missing contributors to <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> to guide development of new interventions.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} thirty five years, debate has evolved about how {{corporatism}} differs from pluralism and about corporatism‘s inadequate notions {{of power and the}} state. The rise of neoliberalism has promoted an even more fatal disdain for the concept both as an analytical construct and as a descriptor of institutions. <b>Faltering</b> <b>growth</b> and surges in unemployment after financial crises in Sweden in 1990 - 93 and in Korea in 1996 - 98 seemed to confirm neo-liberal expectations that all varieties of corporatism (state/authoritarian and societal/democratic) are doomed to decline, and that corporatism in all is guises will converge upon a liberal middle ground. A closer examination of the financial crises during the 1990 s does not entirely dispel the convergence thesis but it is more accurate to conclude that Swedish and Korean institutions of economic policy formation have changed form rather than collapse. Corporatist institutions in these states have been transformed by ideas about networks and governance, interaction between national and international institutions, and shifting alliances among export-oriented and competition-shielded employers, private and public sector unions, and citizens ‘ protest networks.

If supply of mother 2 ̆ 7 s milk or donor milk is inadequate, a breast milk substitute specifically designed for premature infants is the next option. Preterm formula is intended to provide nutrient intakes to match intrauterine growth and nutrient accretion rates and is enriched with energy, macronutrients, minerals, vitamins, and trace elements compared with term infant formulas.

The causes of malnutrition are complex, multidimensional, and population specific. United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has adapted a conceptual framework for facilitating researchers in determining the causes of malnutrition in each area. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine some risk factors of <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> among 3 - 36 month old children in Ahwaz, Iran. Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 180 children 3 - 36 months old in Ahwaz. The subjects were children whose growth curves were horizontal or downward for at least two recent consecutive months. The controls were children with upward growth curves. Data collection was done by face to face interview, family file at the health centers, and direct measurements (mainly for anthropometric measurements). Data analyses were performed by SPSS software. Moreover, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Student’s t-test, and logistic regression were statistical tests which were used according to the type and distribution of the variables. Results: From household variables, the number of family members (P= 0. 013), number of siblings (P= 0. 012), and mother’s educational level (P= 0. 019) showed significant association with <b>growth</b> <b>faltering.</b> Among child variables, the child’s age (P< 0. 001), child’s birth order (P= 0. 031), and birth interval with the next child (P= 0. 004) had significant relationships with <b>growth</b> <b>faltering.</b> Of the child health care variables, the mother’s child care status (P= 0. 017), and the mother’s nutritional knowledge (P= 0. 006) had significant relationships with <b>growth</b> <b>faltering.</b> Finally, the pattern of child nutrition (P< 0. 001), and the age of starting weaning (P < 0. 001) showed significant differences between the two groups.

The southern African historical analysis has shown that an impressive leap in coal production occurred between 1975 and 1985, from about 69 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr) to 179 Mt/yr. By 1989, the cumulative production had reached 4 Gt. Despite this doubling since to just over 8 Gt, the underlying pattern {{has been one of}} <b>faltering</b> <b>growth.</b> Hubbertarian analysis predicts a peak in production rate of about 284 Mt/yr in 2020, at which stage approximately half (12 Gt) of the total resource (23 Gt) will be exhausted. The Waterberg Coalfield (Ellisras Basin) in South Africa may be a remaining large resource, but structural complexity, finely interbedded coal-shale strata at large depths, low grades, high ash content and water scarcity are likely to inhibit its major development. Given South Africa’s heavy dependence on coal for power generation and electricity supply, an anticipated peak production in 2020 will cause problems for future economic growth...|$|E
40|$|When {{writing about}} {{property}} and property rights in his imagined post-capitalist {{society of the}} future, Marx seemed to envisage ‘individual property’ co-existing with ‘socialized property’ in the means of production. As {{the social and political}} consequences of <b>faltering</b> <b>growth</b> and increasing inequality, debt and insecurity gradually manifest themselves, and with automation and artificial intelligence lurking in the wings, the future of capitalism, at least in its current form, looks increasingly uncertain. With this, the question of what property and property rights might look like in the future, in a potentially post-capitalist society, is becoming ever more pertinent. Is the choice simply between private property and markets, and public (state-owned) property and planning? Or can individual and social property in the (same) means of production co-exist, as Marx suggested? This paper explores ways in which they might, through an examination of the Chinese household responsibility system (HRS) and the ‘fuzzy’ and seemingly confusing regime of land ownership that it instituted. It examines the HRS against the backdrop of Marx’s ideas about property and subsequent (post-Marx) theorizing about the legal nature of property in which property has come widely to be conceptualized not as a single, unitary ‘ownership’ right to a thing (or, indeed, as the thing itself) but as a ‘bundle of rights’. The bundle-of-rights idea of property, it suggests, enables us to see not only that ‘individual’ and ‘socialized’ property’ in the (same) means of production might indeed co-exist, but that the range of institutional possibility is far greater than that between capitalism and socialism/communism as traditionally conceived...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives : Estimated intrauterine fetal weight (EIUFW) is {{important}} for reducing prenatal mortality and morbidity through early detection of <b>faltering</b> <b>growth.</b> Our objectives were to develop patterns of ultrasonically determined EIUFW by gestational age, for normal singleton pregnancies, and to assess {{the effect of a}} number of variables on EIUFW. Methods : Ultrasonically, EIUFW was obtained from 600 pregnant women who were at 20 to 42 weeks of gestation (WG). EIUFW was categorized into low weight and normal weight using the tenth and twentieth percentile as the cut-off points. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio and their 95 &#x 0025; confidence limits for a number of risk factors hypothesized to be associated with low fetal weight. EIUFW percentiles (twenty-fifth, fiftieth, and seventy-fifth), by gestational age and sex, were calculated for singleton pregnancies. Results : Up to 32 WG there was no statistically significant difference between male and female fetuses in EIUFW. Between 32 and 39 WG males had significantly (P &# 60;. 05) higher fetal weight than females. Charts of ultrasonically determined EIUFW by gestational age and sex for singleton pregnancies were created. A number of variables were significantly associated with EIUFW such as pregnancy weight gain, maternal hemoglobin level, frequency of antenatal visits, smoking status, and fetal sex. Conclusion : Weight gain during pregnancy should be encouraged for pregnant mothers who gain less than one kilogram per month {{in the second and third}} trimester. A prospective study on a national representative sample in Jordan is needed to generate our own standards for fetal growth...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Growth</b> <b>faltering</b> is {{a common}} health issue in the {{developing}} countries. At times {{we are unable to}} attribute this <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> to lack of adequate nutrients in food or ongoing disease conditions alone. With this study we aim to assess the possibility of the existence of subclinical malabsorption in children with undernutrition. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 161 children from a birth cohort of 377 children who were under follow up from birth for health and disease in three of the urban slums of Vellore. The prevalence of small intestinal enteropathy, as assessed by a 5 hour urinary d-xylose excretion test, was compared between undernourished and well-nourished children. Correlation between undernutrition, d-xylose malabsorption and previous documented illnesses including viral, bacterial or parasitic infections/ infestations was also studied. Results: Xylose test result was abnormal in 41...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, child {{malnutrition}} in Ethiopia has persisted at alarmingly high rates. By applying the conditional nutrition demand approach to household data from three consecutive welfare monitoring surveys {{over the period}} 1996 - 1998, this study identifies household resources, parental education, food prices and maternal nutritional knowledge as key determinants of <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in Ethiopia. Income growth is important for alleviating child stunting, though on its own it will not suffice to reach the international goal of halving each country's level of child malnutrition by 2020. Universalizing access to primary schooling for girls has slightly more promise. However, to reduce child <b>growth</b> <b>faltering</b> in Ethiopia in a significant – and timely-manner, our empirical results indicate that targeted child growth monitoring and maternal nutrition education programs will be needed in conjunction with efforts to promote private income growth and formal schooling...|$|R
40|$|The {{example of}} Central Africa {{shows that in}} a {{markedly}} deprived situation {{the growth of the}} breast-fed infant is impaired right from birth. Mean weight at birth is low. Milk production is also low and early food supplementation is necessary. As a consequence, exposure to infection and parasitosis is increased. The contributions of infection, parasitosis and inadequate food to the <b>faltering</b> of <b>growth</b> in breast-fed infants remains poorly defined. In the environmental and social circumstances described above, it is best to promote exclusive breast-feeding for the first 5 - 6 months of infant life. This is not an easy goal to achieve.
