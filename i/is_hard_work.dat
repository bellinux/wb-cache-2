25|$|Teaching is undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 {{could go to a}} Teacher Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. If students passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. Teaching <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a double shift. Many teachers lack motivation and 60% would move to another job if given the opportunity.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{said that}} to write, you must read extensively, {{both inside and outside}} your chosen genre and to the point of [...] "overflow". He advised that writing <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work,</b> and that writers must [...] "make grammar, {{punctuation}} and spelling a part of your life." [...] However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as [...] "an unavoidable consequence", rather than the reason for writing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} test of the series he was {{dismissed}} for 26 again chasing a wide one when looking set also after 4 centuries were scored by England batsmen in the innings at Lord's, he then scored a hundred in the second innings when England were looking to accelerate. Pietersen posted his highest score of 226 in the second Test at Headingley (it was scored in 262 balls, with 24 fours and 2 sixes), surpassing his previous best of 158 which he had achieved three times. With this score, Pietersen moved ahead of Everton Weekes and Viv Richards to be the batsman with the second-highest run-total out of his first 25 Tests (behind Don Bradman). It is also the highest Test score for England since Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990. This innings subjected the West Indies to an innings and 283 runs defeat, their largest against any team. Pietersen, the Man of the Match, said, [...] "I believe the recipe for success <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work.</b> I've been criticised for throwing my wicket away, and I {{tried to make it}} count here".|$|E
2500|$|To {{signify the}} character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was {{required}} to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work,</b> but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's going to fit in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E
