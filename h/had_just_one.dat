5|$|Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> player {{taken in}} the 2009 draft: cornerback Victor Harris, who was picked by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 157th overall selection. Four Hokies were taken as free-agent {{selections}} after the draft. Defensive end Orion Martin, quarterback Sean Glennon, center Ryan Shuman, and fullback Devin Perez were signed {{to try out for}} various NFL teams.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{fortunes}} declined dramatically {{following the}} victory over Miami. The {{week after that}} win, Tech lost 31–28 to Pittsburgh, then escaped with a one-point win in overtime against Temple University, which <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> win that season. Tech's win against Temple was its last in the regular season. The Hokies lost their final two regular-season games, dropping their overall record to 8–4. To some Virginia Tech fans, the Insight Bowl invitation accepted on December1 was a disappointment after a season that began with hopes {{of participation in the}} national championship game.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{involved}} in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen-SS divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf. On the evening of 11 July, the serviceable armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and assault guns, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf were 77, 95, and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were {{to the north of}} the Psel River with Totenkopf, four were with Leibstandarte, and Das Reich <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for threshing floors. The longer the barn was, the more threshing floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} threshing floors; the earliest <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three threshing floors, allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. In the 2010 Tour, stages classified flat had three intermediate sprint points worth 6, 4, and 2 points to the first three riders across the line. For 2011, flat stages <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> intermediate sprint which was worth 20 points to the rider in first position, and the first 15 score points. The intention was to have riders needing to sprint twice during the day to score well. Points awarded at the finish of flat stages also increased, from 35 points for the winner to 45. Medium mountain stages awarded 30 points to the winner, high mountain stages and the individual time trial gave 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage two. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} a short time for finalizing the {{different}} aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> night to complete shooting and due to the casual nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family to be in it. Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 some paving and {{the walls}} of two unusual {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found in}} other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework, and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but arcuate, with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E
5|$|The Browns were {{expected}} to win their November 9 game against the Brooklyn Dodgers by a wide margin; the Dodgers <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> win, and the Browns scored eight touchdowns when the teams played in September. The Dodgers, however, drove 80 yards on their first possession for a touchdown. Placekicker Phil Martinovich missed the extra point. Cleveland responded as Graham passed to Lavelli for a 72-yard touchdown on the second play from scrimmage on its ensuing possession. Groza kicked through the extra point to give the Browns a 7–6 lead. Cleveland scored again on its next possession, this time a 15-yard pass from Graham to Lew Mayne. After the second touchdown, Graham threw two interceptions and the Browns did not advance the ball past the Brooklyn 42-yard line. The Dodgers, meanwhile, threatened to score numerous times, advancing deep into Cleveland territory. One Brooklyn touchdown by Bob Hoernschmeyer was called back because of a holding penalty. Martinovich contributed to the frustration by missing four field goal tries. He also missed the extra point when the Dodgers did score {{in the fourth quarter}} on a long Monk Gafford rush. The Dodgers' missteps gave the Browns a 13–12 victory, extending their lead over the 49ers for {{the best record in the}} AAFC after San Francisco lost to the Yankees.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{cities in}} New England {{date to the}} last few decades of the 18th century, (e.g. New Haven, Connecticut was {{chartered}} as a city in 1784).

New Hampshire did not have any cities until the 1840s, and for many years prior to the 1860s Vermont <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> city. Even Massachusetts, historically New England's most populous state, did not have any cities until 1822, when Boston was granted a city form of government by the state legislature.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimated}} 13% of Libyan {{citizens were}} unemployed. More than 16% of families had no members earning a stable income, and 43.3% <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one.</b> Despite {{one of the}} highest unemployment rates in the region, there was a consistent labor shortage with over a million migrant workers present on the market. These migrant workers were the bulk of the refugees leaving Libya after the beginning of hostilities. Despite this, Libya's Human Development Index in 2010 was the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia. Libya had welfare systems allowing access to free education, free healthcare, and financial assistance for housing, and the Great Manmade River was built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 1898, George {{was born}} as second son to Rose and Morris Gershwine in their second-floor {{apartment}} on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue.

He <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> given name, {{contrary to the}} American practice by then of giving children a first and a middle name. He was named after his grandfather, a one time Russian army mechanic. He soon became known as George and changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' {{when he became a}} professional musician, and other family members followed suit. After Ira and George, another boy Arthur Gershwin (1900–1981), and a girl Frances Gershwin (1906–1999) were born into the family.|$|E
