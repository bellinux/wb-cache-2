My {{favorite}} is The Art of the Deal, and I also love The Midas Touch which was also co-authored by Robert Kiyosaki." [...] The book inspired Australian entrepreneurs to create a real estate company and name their venture after {{the title of the}} work. Casey Bond wrote for GOBankingRates, [...] "Theoretically, you could <b>just</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> list {{at the end of every}} chapter and get the gist of the book, but I find the value of Midas Touch to be in the storytelling of real-life experiences." ...|$|E

How to turn your Dachshund into a pit bull and yourself into a top-of-the-class student? No problem! <b>Just</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> 50+ humorous guidance and playful instructions in this book that will tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. As the author suggests, [...] "When I was a kid, everybody believed that disciplining a child will create miracles. And sometimes it does. This book is about the fact that everything and everyone can be disciplined. (Except, of course, ourselves, because our personality is as sturdy as the icebergs at the North Pole. When I wrote the first instructions on how to discipline our family members, I suddenly realized: I can discipline anyone from a UFO to the police and the ghost in the attic. And I did, with no mercy!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{manuscript}} {{dropped from}} Henry's hands. A sickening sense of horror overpowered him. The question which {{had occurred to}} his mind {{at the close of}} the First Act of the Play assumed a new and terrible interest now. As far as the scene of the Countess's soliloquy, the incidents of the Second Act had reflected the events of his late brother's life as faithfully as the incidents of the First Act. Was the monstrous plot, revealed in the lines which he had <b>just</b> <b>read,</b> <b>the</b> offspring of the Countess's morbid imagination? or had she, in this case also, deluded herself with the idea that she was inventing when she was really writing under the influence of her own guilty remembrances of the past? If the latter interpretation were the true one, he had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> narrative of the contemplated murder of his brother, planned in cold blood by a woman who was at that moment inhabiting the same house with him. While, to make the fatality complete, Agnes herself had innocently provided the conspirators with the one man who was fitted to be the passive agent of their crime.|$|E

Hayes could not bear that Mr. Bullock should have a chance of seeing, and perhaps making love to Mrs. Catherine in his absence; and though the young woman never diminished her coquetries, but, on the contrary, rather increased them in his presence, it was still a kind of dismal satisfaction to be miserable in her company.|$|E

60|$|Having {{looked at}} the {{portrait}} of his late wife's father {{for a moment and}} smiled, he glanced at the letter in his hand and frowned. Not because he was displeased, but because the writing was cramped and difficult to read. However, the merchant was accustomed to receive such letters from seafaring men on many subjects of interest; he therefore broke the seal and set himself patiently to decipher it. Immediately his countenance became ghastly pale, then it flushed up and became pale again, while he coughed and gasped once or twice, and started up and sat down abruptly. In fact Mr Webster exhibited all the signs of having received a severe shock, and an eye-witness might have safely concluded that he had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> news of some great mercantile loss.
