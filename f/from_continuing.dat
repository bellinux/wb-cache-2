5|$|After Cassandra Cain {{abandoned}} the role a mystery character appeared {{as the new}} Batgirl in the Birds of Prey comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen claimed the empty mantle {{in an attempt to}} honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> in the role. Charlie Gage-Radcliffe acquiesced, but modified her costume and changed her name to Misfit.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} black metal. During the early 1990s when the band was known as Crush Evil, Euronymous, guitarist for the seminal black metal band Mayhem, was planning to stop Crush Evil <b>from</b> <b>continuing.</b> However, this never took place.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Melbourne in 1914. He began life drawing art classes at age 16, but was {{forbidden}} by his father <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> because the subjects were nude. He took up his studies again when he turned 18, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, this time completing his studies to obtain a degree. He also studied under J.S. Watkins in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Metroid: Other M, it was {{reported}} to have a bug where the door in Sector 3 is permanently locked and impassable, preventing players <b>from</b> <b>continuing.</b> Nintendo revealed that a bug is triggered when the player backtracks to the room within Sector 3 where they have previously obtained the Ice Beam. The company has set up a program that allows players affected by the bug to send in an SD card or their Wii console with their save files to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E

5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> the fight, he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long-term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction <b>from</b> <b>continuing.</b> This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> her research.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an explanation}} of why bargainers often terminate negotiations in disagreement in spite of positive expected gains <b>from</b> <b>continued</b> negotiations. The key to the analysis is a model that embeds bargaining activity within a market. Agents are continually faced with the choice between continuing to bargain with an existing partner or searching for a new partner. Bargainers may then terminate negotiations without an agreement, in spite of positive expected. gains <b>from</b> <b>continued</b> bargaining, because seeking a new bargaining partner promises a higher return.

5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> for two days. Instead, {{he prepared}} for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Adlertag did not deter the Luftwaffe <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> its campaign. The assault against RAF airfields {{continued}} throughout August and into September 1940. The battles involved {{large numbers of}} aircraft and heavy losses on both sides. The Luftwaffe failed to develop any focused strategy for defeating RAF Fighter Command. At first, it attempted to destroy RAF bases, then switched to strategic bombing by day and night. It tried to achieve the destruction of several British industries at the same time, switching from bombing aircraft factories, to attacking supporting industries, import or distribution networks such as coastal ports. An attempt was even made against unrelated targets, such as destroying {{the morale of the}} British population.|$|E
5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was recorded by the students themselves. In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except in his apartment). Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E

5|$|The rebels sent envoys to the voivode {{to inform}} him about their grievances, but the envoys were {{captured}} and executed. The voivode invaded the rebels' camp, but the peasants resisted {{and made a}} successful counter-attack, killing many noblemen during the battle. To prevent the rebels <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> the war, the bishop {{and the leaders of}} the noblemen started negotiations with the rebels' envoys. Their compromise was recorded in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. The agreement reduced the tithe by half, abolished the ninth (a seigneurial tax), guaranteed the peasants' right to free movement and authorized them to hold an annual assembly to secure the execution of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some countries, {{the growth}} of men's netball is {{hampered}} by cultural bias against it; when parents see their boys playing it, they actively discourage them <b>from</b> <b>continuing.</b> Despite this, the Cook Islands also has a men's national team that has competed in the 2006, 2009 and 2011 International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament. The popularity of netball is growing amongst men on the island, as sport is an important way of villages keeping in touch with each other.|$|E
5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of the}} road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud to block a possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, the Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E

5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, {{and that he is}} willing to pay Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> to visit the event in the final week.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed <b>from</b> <b>continuing</b> and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in the past was Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E
