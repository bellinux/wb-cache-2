50|$|Consider if {{the best}} {{response}} of the incumbent is to accommodate if the <b>entrant</b> enters. If the incumbent accommodates, the best {{response of the}} <b>entrant</b> is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the <b>entrant</b> enters and the incumbent accommodates if the <b>entrant</b> enters is a Nash equilibrium consistent with backward induction. However, if the incumbent is going to fight, the best response of the <b>entrant</b> is to not enter, and if the <b>entrant</b> does not enter, {{it does not matter}} what the incumbent chooses to do in the hypothetical case that the <b>entrant</b> does enter. Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the <b>entrant</b> enters, but the <b>entrant</b> does not enter is also a Nash equilibrium. However, were the <b>entrant</b> to deviate and enter, the incumbent's best response is to accommodate—the threat of fighting is not credible. This second Nash equilibrium can therefore be eliminated by backward induction.|$|R

40|$|We use {{laboratory}} experiments to evaluate how contestability fares {{in a situation}} where the <b>entrant</b> and the incumbent have their own home markets and opportunities to enter each other’s markets. The disciplining effect in contestable markets depends crucially on hit-and-run entry. If both the <b>entrant</b> and the incumbent firm have their own home markets then the <b>entrant</b> might not like to hit-and-run. Although an <b>entrant</b> can still “hit ” in the incumbent’s market it cannot quite “run ” since the incumbent can enter to “hit ” the <b>entrant</b> in its own market. Our results suggest that the contestability result depends crucially on the relative profits in the <b>entrant’s</b> home and entry markets. We find that if an <b>entrant</b> has its own monopoly market, the <b>entrant</b> and the incumbent tacitly cooperate to achieve profits close to the monopoly level in each market. In contrast, when an <b>entrant</b> is from a more competitive market it exerts considerable disciplining force on the incumbent in the monopoly market...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a dynamic {{game in which}} the players are an incumbent firm in an industry and a potential <b>entrant</b> to that industry. As it stands, the incumbent has a monopoly over the industry and {{does not want to}} lose some of its market share to the <b>entrant.</b> If the <b>entrant</b> chooses not to enter, the payoff to the incumbent is high (it maintains its monopoly) and the <b>entrant</b> neither loses nor gains (its payoff is zero). If the <b>entrant</b> enters, the incumbent can fight or accommodate the <b>entrant.</b> It will fight by lowering its price, running the <b>entrant</b> out of business (and incurring exit costs - a negative payoff) and damaging its own profits. If it accommodates the <b>entrant</b> it will lose some of its sales, but a high price will be maintained and it will receive greater profits than by lowering its price (but lower than monopoly profits).|$|R
50|$|If the <b>entrant</b> enters, {{the best}} {{response}} of the incumbent is to accommodate. If the incumbent accommodates, the best {{response of the}} <b>entrant</b> is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent accommodates if the <b>entrant</b> enters and the <b>entrant</b> enters if the incumbent accommodates is a Nash equilibrium. However, if the incumbent {{is going to play}} fight, the best response of the <b>entrant</b> is to not enter. If the <b>entrant</b> does not enter, it does not matter what the incumbent chooses to do (since there is no other firm to do it to - note that if the <b>entrant</b> does not enter, fight and accommodate yield the same payoffs to both players; the incumbent will not lower its prices if the <b>entrant</b> does not enter). Hence fight can be considered as a best response of the incumbent if the <b>entrant</b> does not enter. Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the <b>entrant</b> does not enter and the <b>entrant</b> does not enter if the incumbent fights is a Nash equilibrium. Since the game is dynamic, any claim by the incumbent that it will fight is an incredible threat because by the time the decision node is reached where it can decide to fight (i.e. the <b>entrant</b> has entered), it would be irrational to do so. Therefore this Nash equilibrium can be eliminated by backward induction.|$|R

40|$|Firms in {{information}} technology (IT) intensive industries rely on IT investments {{to improve the quality}} of their products and services. Competing firms in these industries need to consider two opposing effects when they make IT investment decisions. The declining cost and improving performance of IT over time provides the later <b>entrant</b> a potential cost advantage. On the other hand, the first <b>entrant</b> has the potential to build its market share and retain the market share if consumers incur a cost to switch to the later <b>entrant.</b> In this paper, we analyze the investment strategy of an early <b>entrant</b> that expects the later <b>entrant</b> to have a cost advantage. The results show that in a market with a low (high) switching cost, a decline in IT cost reduces (increases) the investment level of the early <b>entrant.</b> In both types of markets, a higher switching cost mitigates the cost advantage of the later <b>entrant.</b> The results suggest that the early <b>entrant</b> should design a product that imposes a high switching cost.

If, however, the <b>entrant</b> practices "judo economics" and limits its capacity sufficiently, {{it is in the}} incumbent's interest to accommodate entry. The <b>entrant</b> can increase its profits by selling rights (coupons) to its scarce discount output. If the <b>entrant</b> is less efficient, the incumbent will choose to serve coupon holders at the discount price. When this occurs, the <b>entrant</b> sells coupons but no output, and industry production is rationalized. ...|$|R

40|$|Firms often enter {{new markets}} by taking over an incumbent. We analyze a {{potential}} <b>entrant's</b> choice of target under two (exogenously given) takeover mechanisms: (i) auctions, where other incumbents can {{bid for the}} target against the <b>entrant,</b> and (ii) bilateral negotiations between the <b>entrant</b> and the target. The <b>entrant's</b> choice of target depends on the mechanism, {{and it may not}} maximize its ex-post profit (nor consumer welfare). In an auction, the <b>entrant</b> pays a higher price to take over a target with higher synergies, because these impose stronger negative externalities on incumbents and increase their willingness to pay for preventing entry. Auctions increase the price obtained by the target, but reduce welfare compared to negotiations because they may discourage the <b>entrant</b> from acquiring a target with higher synergies...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} product {{differentiation}} decision of a downstream <b>entrant</b> that purchases {{access to a}} bottleneck input from one of two vertically integrated incumbents, who will compete {{with him in the}} downstream market. First, an <b>entrant</b> chooses his product, then the <b>entrant</b> negotiates the access price with two incumbents, and finally the firms compete on retail prices. Counter-intuitively, both the <b>entrant</b> and the access provider prefer that the <b>entrant</b> chooses a product that is a closer substitute of the product of the access provider than of the product of the other incumbent. This occurs because the access provider interacts with the <b>entrant</b> both in the retail market and the wholesale market. We also consider the cases where both parties make the access price offers and where the bargaining stage precedes the location stage. Horizontal differentiation Location Access price...|$|R

Financiers are uncertain of the <b>entrant's</b> true value, but they know the incumbent's true worth. Both firms have to finance a fixed expenditure before starting production.

5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four <b>entrants</b> in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four <b>entrants</b> in the Champions League.
