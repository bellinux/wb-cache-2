25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is <b>frequency</b> <b>weighting</b> in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E

Mechanically, this means that the total number of observations, if we take the <b>frequency</b> <b>weights</b> into account, is 104, 229.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{method of}} the thematic classification of texts {{is based on}} using the <b>frequency</b> <b>weight</b> {{on the list of}} words occurring in texts from the text corpus that determines the theme.

The <b>frequency</b> <b>weight</b> is applied for determining the relevance of the tested text to the theme given via a text corpus: the relevance of the tested text is defined as the value of its <b>frequency</b> <b>weight</b> (see [1]-[3]). In the present work we propose a method of constructing some optimal weights generated via certain variational principles leading to LP (linear programming) problems. A noteworthy feature of those optimal weights is {{a relatively small number of}} words belonging to their supports: in all the examples we considered that number did not exceed 10 percent of the quantity of different words (lemmas) occurring in texts of the corpus, and besides the majority of those words were apparent candidates to be selected as key words of the corpus.

50|$|Ambient {{noise level}} is {{measured}} with a sound level meter. It is usually measured in dB relative to a reference pressure of 0.00002 Pa, i.e., 20 μPa (micropascals) in SI units. A pascal is a newton per square meter. The centimeter-gram-second system of units, the reference sound pressure for measuring ambient noise level is 0.0002 dyn/cm2. Most frequently ambient noise levels are measured using a <b>frequency</b> <b>weighting</b> filter, the most common being the A-weighting scale, such that resulting measurements are denoted dB(A), or decibels on the A-weighting scale.|$|E
50|$|In {{almost all}} countries, {{the use of}} A-frequency-weighting is {{mandated}} {{to be used for}} the protection of workers against noise-induced hearing loss. The A-frequency curve was based on the historical equal-loudness contours and while arguably A-frequency-weighting is no longer the ideal <b>frequency</b> <b>weighting</b> on purely scientific grounds, it is nonetheless the legally required standard for almost all such measurements and has the huge practical advantage that old data can be compared with new measurements. It is for these reasons that A-frequency-weighting is the only weighting mandated by the international standard, the frequency weightings 'C' and 'Z' being optional fitments.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Although {{our current}} weight {{management}} guidelines suggest eating regularly, speculation about whether snacking assists with managing weight occurs widely among the media, weight loss clients and health professionals. We aim {{to examine whether}} there is adequate scientific evidence available to support the manipulation of eating frequently for improving body weight, diabetes and cardiovascular risk markers, and theories that link eating frequently with weight management. Methods: Relevant papers from nutrition and dietetics journals and other sources {{were used to assess}} the association between eating <b>frequency</b> and <b>weight</b> and health. Results: Longer-term evidence suggests eating frequency does not affect weight, glucose, insulin control, hunger or energy expenditure in intentional weight losers and maintainers. There is consistent short-term evidence of an inverse association between blood lipid levels and eating <b>frequency</b> during <b>weight</b> maintenance. Many of the common theories that suggest manipulating eating <b>frequency</b> for <b>weight</b> management are not supported by the literature. Sustaining a change to eating frequency also may be challenging over the longer term. Conclusions: Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating <b>frequency</b> greatly benefits <b>weight</b> and health.
