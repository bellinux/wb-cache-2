5|$|Gustave, in turn, {{had three}} sons. The first, Henry (1862–1914), and third, Wallerand (1866–1914), became {{officers}} in the French Army, serving during the colonial campaigns, including fighting Samory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan.</b> Both {{were killed in the}} early fighting of the First World War. The second son was Adrien, who enlisted in August 1914 as a trooper in the , the regiment in which his son Guy was a cornet.

5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan,</b> Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan,</b> backed by the British, came under threat from {{rebellion}} under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885.|$|E

5|$|Inside the Sudan, {{religion}} {{is an issue}} with growing the game. Most footballers wanting to play are required to wear the hijab and play while fully covered. While football was organised inside the country with 440 men's clubs in 2006, and the first ever women's game being played {{in the country that}} year in February between Tahadi and Sudan University at Sports’ City, Sudan University, development was hindered because a fatwa by the Fiqh Council of Islamic in 2006 condemning the creation of a women's league in Sudan. Still, in the South Sudan in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan.</b> That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game in refugee camps in the Darfur region. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by Al Jazeera.|$|E

Also arrested were U.S. Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Jim Moran (D-Virginia), Rep. John Olver (D-Massachusetts), and Tom Lantos (D-California).

5|$|Seamer {{played the}} best of his cricket while at Oxford University. All four of his {{first-class}} centuries were made for the university side, and his average for Oxford was 35.30, significantly higher than his career average of 20.35. He made his highest score against Free Foresters in his second year, during which he accrued 858 runs, more than double he managed in any other season. On completion of his studies at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of leave. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance. He became a district commissioner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan,</b> and after leaving the service, he taught at Marlborough College and was twice mayor of Marlborough.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan,</b> the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
5|$|On the {{completion}} of his extra year learning Arabic at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service. He continued to play cricket for Somerset during his periods of leave, but it dramatically reduced his availability for the county. During his time at Oxford, Seamer had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset. When Mitchell-Innes graduated from Oxford the year after Seamer, he joined his friend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sudan,</b> where the pair often organised cricket matches, despite the extreme heat. Seamer's duties prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1937, but he appeared eight times the following year through May and early June. His average that season was the highest he achieved after leaving university, recording 20.78 from his 14 innings, though his highest score was 47 runs, scored against Derbyshire. In 1939, the last season of first-class county cricket in England before the Second World War, Seamer played seven times for Somerset. However, unlike his appearances the previous year, {{in which he had}} generally batted as part of the top order, Seamer predominantly appeared in the middle order for the county in 1939, and his highest score was 28.|$|E
