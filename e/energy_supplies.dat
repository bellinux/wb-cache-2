The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars 2 {{features}} {{a number of}} multiplayer modes that can be played online with up to six players. Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents. Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army. Stronghold and Domination are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map. Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment. Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card {{features a}} unit that is deployed on the battlefield. Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and more can be collected as additional <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> are dropped onto the map periodically. There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.|$|E
