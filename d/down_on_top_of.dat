5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the nest and try {{to blend in with}} the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

25|$|Harris's {{nose was}} {{bleeding}} heavily, {{which may have}} caused him to decide to leave the library. Klebold turned and fired a single shot into an open library staff break room, hitting a small television. Before they left, Klebold slammed a chair <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the computer terminal and several books on the library counter, directly above the bureau where Patti Nielson had hidden.|$|E
25|$|Coralee Lever and Vera Jary {{hid behind}} a hessian screen with others. Lever's husband Dennis was fatally {{shot in the}} head. Pauline Masters, Vera Jary's husband Ron, and Peter and Carolyn Nash had {{attempted}} to escape through a locked door but could not. Peter Nash lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> his wife to hide her from Bryant. Bryant moved into the gift shop area where several people, trapped with nowhere to go, were crouched down in the corners. Gwen Neander, trying to escape through the door, {{was shot in the}} head and killed.|$|E
25|$|Both {{sections}} {{struck the}} sea bed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow {{is by far}} the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.|$|E
2500|$|Caterham on the Hill {{is located}} on a {{considerable}} area of upland extending north past adjoining Kenley Aerodrome to Kenley and Hartley Hill in Reedham. [...] This elevated area carries on west until Hooley/Old Merstham and forms a very narrow, fairly steep ridge south of Caterham Valley's centre; east of the centre of Caterham Valley are marginally higher rolling pastures <b>of</b> the North <b>Downs</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a more crevassed smaller mass of upland which forms the village of Woldingham followed by a much larger area of upland stretching from Biggin Hill to Downe and Knockholt, Kent.|$|R

25|$|Mud {{was laid}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Flathead Sandstone as the {{shoreline}} advanced eastward across the Teton area. The resulting soft greenish-gray shale with beds of purple and green sandstone near its base, became the 100 feet (30 m) thick Wolsey Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks that formed when the accumulating mud was briefly {{exposed to the}} air along tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals called brachiopods inhabited these tidal flats {{but as far as}} is known, nothing lived on land. Many shale beds are marked with faint trails and borings of worm-like creatures, and a few contain the remains of tiny trilobites.|$|E
25|$|Barrett went {{up along}} a {{hatchway}} {{to reach the}} starboard side of A Deck where {{there were only two}} lifeboats left. He escaped the sinking ship on lifeboat 13, which was filled with about 65 or 70 people. Lifeboat 15 nearly came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> their lifeboat, but they got out in time. He was put in charge of the lifeboat for about an hour, until he got cold he had to let someone else take over. At one point a woman put a cloak over him, and he was unable to remember anything that took place after that in the lifeboat. At 4:45am Barrett and the others in the lifeboat were rescued by the RMS Carpathia.|$|E
500|$|The stern section {{seems to}} have descended almost vertically, {{probably}} rotating as it fell. Empty tanks and cofferdams imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the poop deck. The section landed {{with such force that}} it buried itself about [...] deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> each other and the hull plating splayed out to the sides. Debris continued to rain down across the seabed for several hours after the sinking.|$|E

500|$|By early 1964, though, the {{continuing}} eruptions {{had built the}} island to such a size that sea water could no longer easily reach the vents, and the volcanic activity became much less explosive. Instead, lava fountains and flows became the main form of activity. These resulted in a hard cap of extremely erosion-resistant rock being laid <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> much of the loose volcanic pile, which prevented the island from being washed away rapidly. Effusive eruptions continued until 1965, by which time the island had a surface area of [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling <b>down...</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> some English kid's head....

2500|$|Under the {{influence}} of the Taliban, men accused of sodomy were sometimes killed by having a wall toppled over them. In February 1998, three men accused of sodomy were taken to the base of a mud and brick wall, which was then toppled over onto them by a tank. A similar death sentence for two men occurred in March 1998. Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Hassan, was reported to say, [...] "Our religious scholars are not agreed on the right kind of punishment for homosexuality. Some say we should take these sinners to a high roof and throw them down, while others say we should dig a hole beside a wall, bury them, then push the wall <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> them." [...] Prior to Taliban rule, the supposedly [...] "Islamic" [...] punishment of having walls toppled onto homosexuals was not precedented.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to popular}} story, {{one day he}} came home early and {{surprised}} his wife who was reading. She put her book <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a bird cage and ran to meet him. He strode across the room, lifted the book and dropped {{it back on the}} bird cage two or three times. Then, he exclaimed: [...] "It works! It works! Don’t you see? If this little cage can hold this heavy book, why can’t an iron or steel cage be the framework for a whole building?" [...] Jenney applied his new idea to the construction of the Home Insurance Building, the first skyscraper in the world, which was erected in 1884 at the corner of LaSalle and Monroe Streets in Chicago. Another source cites the inspiration for the steel skyscraper as coming from vernacular Philippine architecture, where wooden framed construction gave Jenney the idea. The Home Insurance Building was the first example of a steel skeleton building, the first grid of iron columns, girders, beams and floor joists ever constructed.|$|E

[...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen.
