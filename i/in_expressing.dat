Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to <b>in</b> <b>expressing</b> this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E

5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent <b>in</b> <b>expressing</b> opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the differences <b>in</b> <b>expressed</b> emotion among families {{of patients with}} schizophrenia and develop an instrument for expressed emotion. Sample and Setting: A sample of 35 families was selected by using non-probability sampling technique. It was hypothesized {{that there would be}} significant difference <b>in</b> <b>expressed</b> emotion among families of patients with schizophrenia and families of normal subjects. Method: A questionnaire based on Likert Scale technique was used to measure expressed emotion of the families. Those members were selected who have spent at least 35 hours with the patient. Independent t-test was performed to see the difference <b>in</b> their <b>expressed</b> emotion on criticism, hostility, positive remarks, warmth and emotional overinvolvement. Descriptive statistics was used to find out the relationship between demographic variables. Results: The research finding showed a significant difference <b>in</b> <b>expressed</b> emotion between parents of schizophrenics and parents of normal subjects. Conclusion: This is the first study on <b>expressed</b> emotions <b>in</b> Pakistani perspective and provides guidelines for future management in schizophrenia...|$|R

25|$|Another {{mutation}} suspected {{to convey}} the iminoglycinuria phenotype {{may be found in}} the SLC36A1 (PAT1) gene. Identified as the low-affinity intestinal transporter of glycine and imino acids, PAT1 works in cooperation with the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). As absorption and reabsorption of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline occurs through PAT1 as well, it is believed to play another role <b>in</b> <b>expressing</b> the malabsorptive iminoglycinuria phenotype. Recent reports, however, suggest a more diminished role from PAT1 in some cases of the disorder.|$|E
