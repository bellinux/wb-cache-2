5|$|After {{completing}} {{an internship}} {{and a trip}} abroad for postgraduate studies, DeLee was ready {{to set up a}} medical practice by the age of 25. Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with the noted social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided prenatal care to the neighborhood's women, but the babies were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began <b>having</b> <b>their</b> babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E
5|$|As for Edward II himself, his {{dependence}} on the Despensers grew only deeper, and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster's supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) found themselves systematically accused of false charges, being imprisoned and <b>having</b> <b>their</b> lands {{taken over by the}} Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris where they were to be joined by Edward's estranged wife Isabella who was to become Mortimer's lover.|$|E

5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into <b>having</b> <b>their</b> babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs {{aboard the}} ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by <b>having</b> <b>their</b> legs opened with a lancet and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their remains is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds {{because they have}} less ability to move large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians <b>having</b> <b>their</b> populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, {{composed}} as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to {{at least}} partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few process shots were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are <b>having</b> <b>their</b> climactic conversation.|$|E
5|$|Designed both to {{accelerate}} future elections and reduce outside interference, {{the rules of}} Ubi periculum provide for the cardinal electors to be secluded for {{the entirety of the}} conclave, including <b>having</b> <b>their</b> meals passed through a small opening, and for their rations to be reduced to a single meal at the end of three days, or bread and water (with a little wine) after eight days.

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as <b>having</b> <b>their</b> own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began <b>having</b> <b>their</b> silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led the NFL in fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of <b>having</b> <b>their</b> entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led the NFL in rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E

5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each <b>having</b> <b>their</b> own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. <b>Having</b> <b>their</b> muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in <b>having</b> <b>their</b> orders filled, with most <b>having</b> <b>their</b> payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
