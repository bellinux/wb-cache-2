A large proportion is supplied by fishermen from Sassnitz and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, who deliver their catches at agreed fixed prices from their own cutters, using rented fish tanks or by truck to the pier of the modern fish processing centre.

According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is {{the origin of the}} figurative meaning of red <b>herring.</b> In the <b>piece,</b> William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding [...] "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone."
