5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} over {{why she did}} not step up to do Renaissance's pitches, Claire {{answered that}} she would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have done so at the start, but felt she was set up as a scapegoat after Kevin was initially dead set on doing so, but asked her {{later on in the}} task to take over. Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E
25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E

50|$|As the war progressed, the {{attitude}} of the National Socialist authorities towards members of the German princely houses changed.

25|$|The Bengals {{were also}} a team on the rebound. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, quarterback Boomer Esiason and head coach Sam Wyche had openly feuded, and the team {{finished}} with a miserable 4–11 record. A lot of Bengals fans would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see them both leave the team, but they worked out their differences in the offseason, and Esiason ended up having the best season of his career en route to Super Bowl XXIII. During the regular season, he threw for 3,572 yards and 28 touchdowns with only 14 interceptions, while also rushing for 248 {{yards and a touchdown}} on 43 carries. Esiason's performance made him the top-rated quarterback in the league with a 97.4 passer rating and earned him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
500|$|Having {{admired her}} {{performance}} in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page {{in the lead}} role, saying that when he read the screenplay {{for the first time}} he pictured her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had [...] "in mind right from the start" [...] were Olivia Thirlbywho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Junoand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: [...] "This is a movie that’s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn’t make sense." ...|$|E
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or {{on the issues of}} Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.|$|E
50|$|The British Navigation Acts of the 1690’s, {{which further}} {{restricted}} all shipping to British ships and ports, {{cut off the}} Leister Party’s Dutch merchants from their usual shipping agents in Holland.

40|$|Though India and Burma {{shared a}} colonial identity, {{they have since}} {{independence}} had a more complicated and divergent relationship. Burma looks to India to counterbalance China's overweening influence, an interest India shares and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> abet.

2500|$|Gloucestershire added 40 runs on {{the last}} day, and then Kent batted out the day for a draw, {{finishing}} on 229 for 5 declared. Walker and Stevens had time to score half-centuries, and Geraint Jones had some useful batting practice in getting to 36 not out, {{but there was never}} much prospect of a result once the follow-on was saved. Kent captain David Fulton said, [...] "If there had been any realistic chance of a result we would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> go for it. But the pitch has just got flatter, and it was obvious we couldn't really hope to bowl them out quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2001, HBO aired a {{documentary}} entitled A Question of Miracles {{that focused on}} Hinn and a well-documented fellow Word-of-Faith German minister based in Africa, Reinhard Bonnke. Both Hinn and Bonnke offered full access to their events to the documentary crew, and the documentary team followed seven cases of [...] "miracle healings" [...] from Hinn's crusade over the next year. The film's director, Antony Thomas, told CNN's Kyra Phillips {{that they did not}} find any cases where people were actually healed by Hinn. Thomas said in a New York Times interview that [...] "If I had seen miracles , I would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> trumpet it... but in retrospect, I think they do more damage to Christianity than the most committed atheist." ...|$|E

50|$|Handel {{published}} eight keyboard suites in 1720. It is possible, though unproven, {{that some}} of them were written at Cannons.

2500|$|Dmitry Konstantinovich was entranced {{with his}} new position, one of which demanded that he {{traveled}} across Russia and Europe, selecting the finest horses. Acting on his advice, the Imperial Stud purchased Galtee More, who had won the Derby in Great Britain, for an astronomical 200,000 rubles; {{as soon as he}} arrived in Russia, the thoroughbred was put to stud at Tsarskoye Selo. [...] Dmitry Konstantinovich held the post until 1905, when he was replaced with Major-General Alexei Zdnovich. On 10 January 1904, Dmitry Konstantinovich relinquished command of the Horse Guard grenadiers Regiment. Although he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> remain in his post, his eyesight was failing rapidly, in detriment to his military career. Reluctantly he recognized that by remaining he was depriving another, more capable man of advancement. On leaving active service, the grand duke generously gave his dacha at Krasnoye Selo to the Horse Guards Regiment, to be used as an officer’s club.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Nightingale" [...] made Jenny Lind {{known as}} The Swedish Nightingale well before she became an {{international}} superstar and wealthy philanthropist in Europe and the United States. Strangely enough, the nightingale story became a reality for Jenny Lind in 1848–1849, when {{she fell in}} love with the Polish composer Fryderyk Chopin (1810–1849). His letters reveal that he felt [...] "better" [...] when she sang for him, and Jenny Lind arranged a concert in London to raise funds for a tuberculosis hospital. With the knowledge of Queen Victoria, Jenny Lind attempted unsuccessfully to marry Chopin in Paris in May 1849. Soon after, she had to flee the cholera epidemic, but returned to Paris shortly before he died of tuberculosis on 17 October 1849. Jenny Lind devoted the rest of her life to enshrining Chopin's legacy. Lind never recovered. She wrote to Andersen on 23 November 1871 from Florence: [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> die for this my first and last, deepest, purest love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abandoning {{his office}} job, {{he decided to}} instead take up both writing and {{illustrating}} his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as Anon E. Mouse for the local paper Anon, and St. Pancras Panda, a parody of Paddington Bear, for the Oxford-based Back Street Bugle. His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in NME music magazine, and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as Roscoe Moscow published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill) in the weekly music magazine Sounds, earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter Leah, began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income. Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as Maxwell the Magic Cat in the Northants Post, under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child-murderer Gilles de Rais, something he {{found to be a}} [...] "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing Maxwell the Magic Cat until 1986. Moore has stated that he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community. Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them, stating that [...] "After I'd been doing [...] for a couple of years, I realised that I {{would never be able to}} draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist." ...|$|E
