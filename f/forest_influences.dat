40|$|Globally, many forest {{ecosystems}} that undergo harvesting are adapted to natural disturbances such as fire. However, harvested forests can have depleted biodiversity due to different ecological impacts between harvesting and natural disturbance. To minimise the ecological changes due to forest harvesting, management techniques {{have been developed}} that better mimic the effects of natural disturbance. These techniques focus on retaining structural components of the pre-disturbance forest within harvested areas. Retained structures create more mature environmental conditions within the harvested area; these mature conditions encourage recolonisation and development of mature communities. Aggregated retention {{is an example of}} a management technique that retains mature forest elements. It involves the retention of patches (aggregates) of trees within harvested units. Retained aggregates have multiple benefits; they provide areas for mature forest species to persist through the disturbance period (“lifeboating”), and they can create more mature forest like conditions within the harvested area through “forest influence” – edge effects that occur within disturbed forest due to proximity to a nearby standing mature <b>forest.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>influence</b> works through mechanisms such as shading and the reduction of dispersal distance. Aggregated retention and other similar techniques have been implemented across many forest systems throughout the world. However, little is known about how effective they are for various groups of organisms. In Tasmanian forests, aggregated retention has been identified as an effective harvesting method for sustainable harvesting, yet information on how <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> impacts environmental conditions and community structure is limited. Gaining knowledge on how increasing environmental maturity and the ways in which <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> can aid in the return of pre-disturbance biological communities is crucial in the adaptive management of retention harvesting systems both in Tasmania and globally. In this thesis, I investigate the impacts of <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> on important abiotic components, specifically microclimate. I then assess the benefits of increased environmental maturity on recolonisation of bryophyte flora and the role that <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> can have in bryophyte recolonisation. These topics are addressed across four experimental chapters. The first experimental chapter investigates how environmental conditions within harvested forest impacts on the level of maturity of bryophyte communities (Chapter 2). This is achieved by creating a measure of bryophyte community maturity within harvested forest. Various environmental conditions were then tested to see if they impact the recolonisation of mature bryophyte flora. Following on from this, I investigate whether distance from a mature <b>forest</b> edge (<b>forest</b> <b>influence)</b> can adjust the microclimate of disturbed forests (Chapter 3). Patterns in <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> on bryophyte communities are then investigated (Chapter 4) to determine whether plots closer to a mature forest edge experience more rapid recolonisation by bryophytes. These questions are tested by sampling microclimate and bryophyte community composition across mature forest/harvested edges and analysing how condition change with distance from an edge. Additionally, as restoration of harvested areas is highly dependent on successional processes, the benefits of increased maturity and <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> need to be assessed through time. Consequently, Chapters 2 - 4 were based on a chronosequence (space for time) study of sites that were previously clearfelled, to enable temporal impacts to be assessed. Finally, this thesis examines whether isolated aggregates generate the same level of microclimatic <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> as the <b>forest</b> bordering the harvested area (Chapter 5). This comparison will help determine whether aggregated retention silviculture is an effective technique in generating environmental maturity within harvested forest. Results of the thesis showed that mature environmental conditions within harvested areas did increase the maturity of bryophyte community compositions. Microclimate conditions were shown to be of particular importance in determining the community maturity of bryophytes within harvested forest. Results from Chapter 3 then showed that <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> is an ecological process that can create mature forest microclimate conditions. Areas next to a mature forest edge experienced microclimatic conditions that were more similar to mature forest conditions within harvested areas. As well as its impact on microclimate, Chapter 4 showed that <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> also impacted bryophyte communities. Bryophyte communities recover quicker in areas next to an edge compared to areas further away. In the final experimental chapter (Chapter 5), results showed that aggregated retention is an effective method to create microclimate <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> within harvested areas. Overall, I have shown that <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> is effective at creating mature forest conditions within regenerating harvested forest, and that bryophyte recolonisation is aided by increased environmental maturity. This information can be used to refine management techniques, such as aggregated retention, which are designed to encourage <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> for facilitating the successful restoration of harvested areas. The temporal response to <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> and the development of mature environmental conditions shows that future studies on the benefits of retention forestry should consider time since disturbance when reporting results...|$|R

40|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{adversely}} affected by clearcutting of Australian eucalypt forests for timber.

Few studies, however, have addressed how plant genotype affects herbivore population dynamics. In this paper, we use a simulation modeling approach to ask how the genetic composition of a <b>forest</b> <b>influences</b> pest outbreak dynamics, using the example of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and forest tent caterpillars (FTC; Malacosoma disstria). Specifically, we examine how plant genotype, the relative size of genotypic patches, and the rate of insect dispersal between them, affect the frequency, amplitude, and duration of outbreaks. We find that coupling two different genotypes does not necessarily result in an averaging of insect dynamics. Instead, depending on the ratio of patch sizes, when dispersal rates are moderate outbreaks in the two-genotype case may be more or less severe than in forests of either genotype alone. Thresholds for different dynamic behaviors are similar for all genotypic combinations. Thus, the qualitative behavior of a stand of two different genotypes can be predicted based on the response of the insect to each genotype, the relative sizes of the two patches, and the scale of insect dispersal...|$|E

30|$|The {{emergence}} of the supply-side school within the past decade reflects advances in regional climate modelling, new ideas in atmospheric physics and more accurate measurement of water molecules through the hydrological cycle. Prominent scholars within the supply-side school posit that <b>forests</b> <b>influence</b> climate and weather at regional and global scales in ways {{that have not been}} properly acknowledged by climate policy or modelling. The strongest advocates of supply-side thinking challenge both the carbon-centric priority of forest policy and the demand-side perspective of hydrology. Ellison et al. write: “For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product” (Ellison et al. 2017). There is disagreement on how much <b>forests</b> <b>influence</b> hydrological cycles (see van der Ent et al. 2012), but still most researchers in the field believe that it is prudent to preserve forests for their climatic stabilizing role. Despite uncertainty, supply-side scholars argue that the climatic <b>influences</b> of <b>forests</b> should underpin global forest policy. This viewpoint is having its influence on policies from the European Union to the Amazon. A 2012 report for the European Union from researchers at the British Met Office argues that forests “play {{a major role in the}} atmospheric circulation and the water cycle on land and may have a role in mitigating regional climate, desertification and water security problems” (Sanderson et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Fire {{and timber}} {{harvesting}} can diminish {{the extent of}} older forests in the near term. The amount and configuration of mature and regenerating forest in the landscape (landscape structure) influences habitat suitability for mature-forest-associated species. We applied spatial analysis to describe the landscape structure of three wet eucalypt forest landscapes in south–eastern Australia and used the results from empirical biodiversity studies to frame interpretation of possible impacts on habitat suitability. We determined the extent of structurally mature forest, its reservation status, {{and the extent to}} which it may be edge affected. We also assessed how landscape structure potentially impacts the re-establishment of mature-forest-associated species into previously harvested areas through the proximity to (mature <b>forest</b> <b>influence)</b> —and extent of (landscape context) —mature forest in the surrounding landscape. Our analyses were designed to inform forest management initiatives that draw on these landscape-scale concepts. Central Highlands Victoria had less structurally mature eucalypt forest (4 %) compared to North West Tasmania (14 %) and Southern Forests Tasmania (21 %). Detrimental effects of edge influence on structurally mature forest appeared relatively minor. Low levels of mature <b>forest</b> <b>influence</b> combined with low-medium surrounding mature forest cover (landscape context) indicate potential limitations on recolonisation of coupes by mature-forest-associated species.

Although ring detection in hawthorn is difficult, clear dynamics in establishment and growth of this shrub species were found. Establishment was mainly influenced by inundation (length and height). The effect of inundation on establishment is location dependent; positive due to transport and deposition of seeds in higher areas, and negative due to drowning of young plants in lower locations. Extreme climatic events were found to influence establishment including a drought in 2003 and relatively low and high precipitation in 2004 – 2006 and 2007 respectively. These events combined with almost no inundation caused some anomalies in the time series for hawthorn establishment. Once above a certain height, hawthorn is able to withstand various abiotic disturbances occurring in these dynamic river floodplains. Excavated areas are enhancing forest development following hawthorn establishment and therefore these areas should be limited in size (e. g. by deeper and narrower excavations and thus a steeper transition towards the grasslands) ...|$|E

40|$|The natural {{vegetation}} Of the Sudan, ranging from desert scrub to tropical rain {{forests in the}} extreme southwest, {{is related to the}} occurrence of clayey and sandy soils and to rainfall which increases from almost zero southwards to over 1, 200 mm. The southern third of the Sudan is the site of natural forests, while the main consuming centres lie in the populous north. To attain a self-sufficiency level in timber by 1985 plantations should be established at the rate of about 21, 000 feddans annually. For gum Arabic, the country's second export, the operating marketing system should be reviewed to ensure more returns to the tappers. Wholesale deforestation has rendered many formerly inhabited areas in the north a part of the desert; stray fires, grazing and agricultural practices undertaken in the forest have diminished the already limited forest wealth of the country and rendered erosion, sandstorms and desert encroachment serious problems. The adaptation of cultivation to forestry, the completion of fire-lining before early burnings take place and the provision of adequate water centres are urgently required by the situation. Forestry has a more favourable impact on the terrain and climate than other types of land use. For forest plantations established on good quality land, the per unit area financial returns can compete very favourably with those for irrigated cotton, and are higher than those for "dura", wheat, ground nuts and grazing.

40|$|The habitat {{selection}} of the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana has been examined on multiple spatial scales. Habitat variables of territories and random points were measured in the field on a 25 m radius and from GIS layers on scales of 25 m, 100 m, 500 m and 1, 000 m radius. Habitat variables were analysed by a generalized linear model. The ortolan bunting was found on a 25 m radius in areas with a few black pines, with low grass and open patches within the herbaceous layer. On a 100 m radius scale, the probability of occurrence was highest in areas with meadows with large trees, permanent and partly overgrown meadows, and small areas of forests. On a 500 m radius scale, the occurrence of the ortolan bunting was negatively affected by urban areas and their infrastructure and by forests, and positively by partly overgrown meadows and permanent meadows with or without large trees. On a 1, 000 m radius, permanent meadows with or without large trees, {{and the absence of}} large urban areas and infrastructure positively affected the presence of the ortolan bunting. In conclusion, factors influencing habitat selection by the ortolan bunting differ according to spatial scale.

Factors influence habitat selection differently on different scales; a <b>forest</b> <b>influences</b> the probability of a territory positively on a small scale while negatively on larger scales.

With two closely timed fires, dominant boreal conifers such as black spruce (Picea mariana) may be vulnerable to regeneration failures after fire because of the long time required to reach reproductive maturity. I report on the relationship between stand age and seed productivity of black spruce in northern Yukon Territory and central Alaska. I used fire history maps to select sites of various stand ages, including stand ages that would occur in a short fire return interval (less than 80 years) versus longer fire intervals (up to 200 years). At each site, I measured stand density and basal area using the point-center-quarter method. Ten black spruce trees were randomly selected for cone surveys and age analysis. I also selected a subset of five trees for detailed analyses of cone and seed production within yearly cohorts. The results of this study illustrate the strong relationships between stand age and stand basal area with cone and seed production of northern black spruce. The resulting equations can be used to predict the seed capacity and regeneration potential of black spruce stands with known stand basal area or stand age. I estimate, along with the number of seeds required to produce a two year old black spruce seedling on high quality seedbeds, stands burned at an age less than 50 years will likely have reduced black spruce post-fire density. On low quality seedbeds, black spruce forests are more vulnerable to regeneration failures and fire cycles less than 150 years are likely to result in reduced recruitment.

The effects were studied in small (two-turbine) as well as large wind-turbine arrays. For every case, simulations are performed separately for two identical setups, with and without forest. The results of the simulations in the forest case are further compared to the results of the corresponding non-forest case to clearly show the changes in the wake and turbulence structure due to the forest. Moreover, the actual mechanical shaft power produced by each turbine in the small wind-turbine array and by a single turbine in the large array is calculated for the forest and non-forest cases. Aerodynamic efficiency and power losses due to forest are discussed as well. It is found that the loss of actual power due to forest amounts to nearly 20 %. The blade angle of attack is studied for cases with and without forest. It is found that a non-optimal angle of attack in the forest case is responsible for the power loss. Therefore, an active pitch control is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} loss of actual power in the forest...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and composition of a <b>forest</b> <b>influences</b> {{the way in which}} it responds to disturbance. At the same time disturbances such as fire, human activity, and climate variability affect vegetation {{structure and}} composition. (Amo and Hartwell, 1995; Mast et al., 1998; Ehle and Baker, 2003). By understanding how a forest has responded to past disturbance and climate, one can better predict how it might respond to, as well as influence, future disturbances. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between stand structure and age classes of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, disturbance, and climate along the Boise Front Range, located to the north and east of Boise, Idaho. Specifically, this study intended to answer two research questions. First, what is the state (age classes, species present) of individual and collective mixed conifer stands in the Cottonwood Creek drainage? Second, are tree recruitment periods and growth related to disturbance events, specific periods of certain climatic conditions, or elements of both? Over the summer of 2004, trees in each of twelve 30 x 30 meter plots within the 31 km 2 Cottonwood Creek drainage were sampled. Cores were processed according to standard dendrochronological methods, and tree ages, as well as stand composition, were compared with instrumental climate records and fire history for the area. It does appear that there are several influences on stand and age structure in the Cottonwood Creek drainage. First, the ratio of ponderosa pine to Douglas-fir decreases as elevation increases. Second, both precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) influence tree growth in both species. Douglas-fir growth and yearly average precipitation had an r=. 82 (p 3 ̆c. 01) correlation value and an r=. 53 (p 3 ̆c. 02) value for PDSI. Ponderosa pine growth was most highly correlated with prior-year spring precipitation (April-June) (r=. 41) (p 3 ̆c. 05), and correlated with PDSI at almost the same level (r=. 43) (p 3 ̆c. 05). This relationship indicates that both species respond positively to both high precipitation years and years with high (wet) PDSI values. The influence of these climate variables may also be tied to recruitment pulses for both species, but further work should be done to see if a statistical correlation actually exists. Evidence for tree recruitment pulses being tied to the occurrence of wildfires is inconclusive at this time and should be examined further, as should the potential influence of other climate signals, such as the EI Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{are serious}} water {{problems}} in China, which limit the sustainable development {{of society and}} economy, such as the shortage of water resources, the uneven space and time distribution of water resources, water quality deterioration, water environment worsening, frequent drought and flood disasters, severe water and soil loss. Increasing the forest/vegetation coverage is an important approach for solving the water problems. Several large-scaled ecological forestry programs are being carried out in China, and both theoretical and technical supports for the programs are urgently needed. However, the existing forest hydrological research results are not yet sufficient. The research contents are not enough integrated and systematic, the research scale is too small, the studied processes are in separate, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about the water-stability of forest/vegetation, the regional <b>forest</b> hydrological <b>influence</b> can not be accurately predicted. The theory and technology to guide the regulation of forest-water relation and the watershed management are not yet fully developed. Therefore, the key points to be strengthened in future research are suggested: encouraging the multi-section and multi-subject researches, the water consumption and water-stability of forest/vegetation, the mechanism and scale-effect of <b>forest</b> hydrological <b>influences</b> and their scale transformation, the prediction and evaluation of regional <b>forest</b> hydrological <b>influences,</b> the effect on water quality by forest/vegetation, the techniques of vegetation restoration/management as protectio...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{intimate}} significance of trees and woods through research on how people engage with and perform their bodies in different kinds of wooded environments in contemporary Britain. We argue that there are significant, contested and ambivalent affordances provided by woods and forests in contemporary Britain - as providing `live' contact with nature, {{as a source of}} tranquillity, and as providing a distinct `social' space {{in sharp contrast to the}} pressures of modern living. Second, there is considerable variation in the bodily experiences that people gain from woods and <b>forests,</b> <b>influenced</b> by personal and family life-stage, socio-economic circumstance and geographical location. The values people appear to attach to woods and forests arise from the specific `affordances' that the latter could offer for bodily desires. There are, we might say, different `contested' natures of the forest...|$|R
