50|$|On June 1, 2016, Lacuna Coil officially {{announced}} a <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour beginning in October 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Force Catalogue - misleadingly {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the 'European Rapid Reaction Force' ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> {{was built}} upon an earlier {{bilateral}} Franco-British Joint Declaration adopted at St. Malo in December 1998. The St. Malo Declaration {{said that the}} European Union {{ought to have the}} capability for “autonomous action backed up by credible military forces” as part of a common defence policy. The St. Malo Declaration laid the political foundation between France and the Great Britain, which in turn facilitated the launch of the European Security and Defence Policy and the formulation of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour, they {{returned}} to the US for a nationwide tour where they were accompanied by opening acts Ghost Beach, Blondfire, and Strange Talk.|$|R
25|$|A theatric {{performance}} of the rock opera is also planned, but after the release a common <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour with Imperial Age is scheduled for the February - April 2018.|$|R
50|$|The Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Catalogue is {{a listing}} of rapid {{reaction}} forces composed of 60,000 troops managed by the European Union, but under control of the countries who deliver troops for it.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014 the band, {{consisting}} of Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Ashton Irwin, and Calum Hood, announced the <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> dates, and later followed this up with announcements for both Australia and the US.|$|R
50|$|Adele {{announced}} the Western <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> dates on 26 November 2015. After tickets {{went on sale}} on 4 December, many venues reported sell-outs, resulting in extra dates being added in multiple cities on the itinerary.|$|R
5000|$|Following their US tour dates, Hundred Waters began a <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour. On July 14, 2014 Hundred Waters and Interpol {{announced}} {{that they would be}} touring the United States and Canada together during Fall 2014.|$|R
50|$|Nick's <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> {{tour in the}} Fall of 2014 saw {{him play}} 12 shows across Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium & France. The tour {{included}} sold out shows in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne and Amsterdam.|$|R
50|$|The Age of Nero is {{the seventh}} studio album by Norwegian black metal band Satyricon. It was {{released}} on 3 November 2008, through Roadrunner Records. The release was backed by a full <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour opening in Stavanger, Norway on 12 November and ending in Hamburg, Germany on 20 December.|$|R
5000|$|The European Union {{made its}} first {{concrete}} step to enhance military capabilities, {{in line with the}} ESDP, in 1999 when its member states signed the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal.</b> They include the creation of a catalogue of forces, the 'Helsinki Force Catalogue', to be able to carry out the so-called “Petersberg Tasks”. The EU launched the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP) at the Laeken Summit in December 2001. However, {{it became clear that the}} objectives outlined in the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> were not achievable quickly. In May 2004, EU defence ministers approved [...] "Headline Goal 2010", extending the timelines for the EU's projects. However, it became clear that the objectives cannot be achieved by this date too. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé espressed his desperation: “The common security and defense policy of Europe? It is dead.” ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a part of}} {{promotion}} for the 'Steelcrusher' album {{the band}} went on a European tour supporting Napalm Death in April 2014, and followed in October 2014 on their very first <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour.For further tour promotion the band played in many international festivals such as 'RockHarz', 'Rock Your Brain' and 'Brutal Assault'.|$|R
50|$|The kit {{used by the}} Maltese foot soldier {{has changed}} {{drastically}} in recent years. The fiat for change was given to C Company prior to its successful participation in the multi-national Partnership for Peace exercise in 1996. Following Malta’s pledge towards the EU’s Military <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> in 2000, procurement received another boost.|$|R
50|$|The Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was a {{military}} capability target set for 2003 during the December 1999 Helsinki European Council meeting {{with the aim of}} developing a future European Rapid Reaction Force. There was much interest in the idea of a single EU military force, and inexact characterisations of the initiative (which was not much more than some headquarters arrangements and a list of theoretically available national forces) led to imprecise journalistic depictions about a unified European Army. Following the initial declaration in December 1999, the formal agreement on the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was reached on November 22, 2004 and according to statements made by EU officials the first units will be deployable in 2007. Since January, 1st of 2007 60,000 soldiers have been available for a possible European Rapid Reaction Force who are potentially deployable for at least a year.|$|R
50|$|In {{further support}} of the record, they have lined up a {{supporting}} tour of The Amity Affliction in Australia, including two headline shows of their own in the country, and a Canadian tour; all across August and September. Across February and March 2015 Architects have lined-up a <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour with Every Time I Die, Blessthefall and Counterparts supporting.|$|R
5000|$|On May 16, 2013, {{on their}} {{official}} Twitter, The Sounds posted {{a preview of}} their new single [...] "Shake Shake Shake", the first single off of their new album. [...] "Shake Shake Shake" [...] was subsequently released on May 23, 2013. In June, {{it was revealed that}} The Sounds will embark on a <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour in November 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{band played}} their first European show at Hellfest in June 2013. They {{embarked}} {{on their first}} full <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour in November and December 2015 alongside Angelus Apatrida and Distillator which included an appearance at Eindhoven Metal Meeting and culminated in a show at the Camden Underworld in London. In early 2016, the band embarked on an American tour opening for Voivod.|$|R
50|$|On 23 October 2016, {{five days}} prior {{to the release of}} the Lady Wood, Lo {{announced}} North American and <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> Lady Wood Tour, with special guests Phoebe Ryan and Broods, to promote the album. Various South American dates, Australian dates, other miscellaneous concerts, and festival dates were later announced at different times. The tour began on 6 February 2017 in Seattle, Washington.|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 2011, Red Fang was {{announced}} {{as one of}} the openers (the other being The Dillinger Escape Plan) for Mastodon's 2011 and 2012 tours in the United States and Europe respectively. Later in 2012, Red Fang embarked on a <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour with Black Tusk, performing {{for the first time in}} various countries including Russia, Ukraine, and Greece.|$|R
50|$|The EU {{currently}} has a limited mandate over defence issues, with {{a role to}} explore the issue of European defence agreed to in the Amsterdam Treaty, as well as oversight of the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Force Catalogue (the 'European Rapid Reaction Force') processes. However, some EU states may and do make multilateral agreements about defence issues outside of the EU structures.|$|R
5000|$|As the Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> became fulfilled, the European Council of June 2004 {{approved}} to further develop the EU’s military crisis management capability {{and a new}} target was set: the [...] "Headline Goal 2010". EU members made the commitment {{that by the year}} 2010, at the latest, they would be capable of responding [...] "with swift and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach" [...] to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty of the EU and the 2003 EU Security Strategy (i.e. humanitarian and rescue tasks, disarmament operations, support to third countries in combating terrorism, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, and peacemaking). The EU also aims to address the shortfalls from the previous <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> (e.g. gaps related to strategic airlift and sealift) which are still considered to be a limiting factor to the operability of the designated forces, especially in more demanding crisis management operations.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, Hurts {{performed}} a NME Awards show at London's Heaven and a gig at Berlin's Postbahnhof, before {{embarking on a}} twelve-date <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour, which kicked off in Cologne on 14 March and ended in Glasgow on 2 April. The second leg of the tour started on 25 October 2013, visiting countries such as the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Czech Republic, Germany and Luxembourg.|$|R
50|$|Several ceasefires were agreed {{during the}} 1990s, but none lasted, and the {{conflict}} hit <b>European</b> <b>headlines</b> when four French tourists disappeared, both sides blaming each other. Father Augustin Diamacoune Senghor {{had come to}} lead the MFDC and pursued a policy of talks and reconciliation. However, the Senegalese government refused to consider independence for the region, leading some MFDC members to split and restart the fighting.|$|R
50|$|Inequality and inequities have {{significantly}} increased in recent decades, possibly {{driven by the}} worldwide economic processes of globalisation, economic liberalisation and integration. This has led to states ‘lagging behind’ on <b>headline</b> <b>goals</b> such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and different levels of inequity between states have been argued to {{have played a role}} in the impact of the global economic crisis of 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|The Battlegroups {{project is}} not to be {{confused}} with the projected Helsinki <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> force, which concerns up to 60,000 soldiers, deployable for at least a year, and take one to two months to deploy. The Battlegroups are instead meant for more rapid and shorter deployment in international crises, probably preparing the ground for a larger and more traditional force to replace them in due time.|$|R
50|$|The band {{embarked}} on the headlining Mothership Tour in the United States and Canada from September 22 to October 27, 2016. The tour included support from The Contortionist, Hail the Sun, Good Tiger, and The White Noise. A <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour took place from November 3 to November 26, 2016 with special guest appearances from former members Jonny Craig and Kurt Travis {{in honor of}} the band's 10th Anniversary.|$|R
5000|$|The SDGs {{have been}} criticized for being contradictory, because in seeking high levels of global GDP growth, they will {{undermine}} their own ecological objectives. It has also been noted that, in relation to the <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> of eliminating extreme poverty, [...] "a growing number of scholars are pointing out that $1.25 is actually not adequate for human subsistence", and the poverty line should be revised to as high as $5.|$|R
25|$|Toto {{released}} their fourteenth studio {{album and}} their first {{in nine years}} titled Toto XIV on March 20 (Europe), March 23 (UK and Oceania), and March 24, 2015 (North America). To promote the newly finished project, the band started a world tour running with an extensive <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> arena tour including appearances at key festivals, along with a North American tour {{to follow in the}} summer of 2015 and Asia later that year.|$|R
2500|$|They also {{performed}} at the Metaltown Festival and Download Festival in June 2012. From July 13 to August 28, 2012, Trivium took part in Metal Hammer's [...] "Trespass America Festival" [...] headlined by Five Finger Death Punch with additional support from Battlecross, God Forbid, Pop Evil, Emmure and Killswitch Engage. On October 15, 2012, Trivium commenced a <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour, supported by Caliban, As I Lay Dying and Upon A Burning Body.|$|R
50|$|Toto {{released}} their fourteenth studio {{album and}} their first {{in nine years}} titled Toto XIV on March 20 (Europe), March 23 (UK and Oceania), and March 24, 2015 (North America). To promote the newly finished project, the band started a world tour running with an extensive <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> arena tour including appearances at key festivals, along with a North American tour {{to follow in the}} summer of 2015 and Asia later that year.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004 Zao {{released}} The Funeral of God—a concept {{album that}} imagined {{a world where}} God had chosen to abandon mankind. Ferret heavily advertised the album, the group made their first music video (for [...] "The Rising End"), and went on several tours of the US, resulting in the biggest selling Zao album to date. Though they had played a few shows there before, Zao did their first ever extensive <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> tour with this lineup.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band played}} on the Red Bull Studios Live Stage at Download on Sunday 15 June 2014. In March and April 2015 they {{supported}} Australian band Karnivool on their UK and <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour. They played at Hevy music festival on Saturday 15 August. In due to Mike Malyan's back and shoulder injury https://www.facebook.com/thisismonuments/videos/10152908075736114/, he {{decided to leave the}} band. On 11 August 2015 Anup Sastry, former Intervals drummer was announced as a new drummer https://www.facebook.com/thisismonuments/photos/a.407067821113.190224.304610696113/10152910242766114/?type=3&permPage=1 ...|$|R
25|$|In January 2007, Bring Me the Horizon {{were able}} to set their sights beyond the UK, when they {{replaced}} Bury Your Dead on Killswitch Engage's <b>European</b> <b>headline</b> tour. The slot became available after Bury Your Dead were forced to withdraw by the departure of their vocalist, Mat Bruso, from the band. Bring Me The Horizon's presence on the tour was poorly received by fans of Killswitch Engage, with concert attendees regularly throwing bottles at the band before they even started playing their set.|$|R
50|$|In October 2015, {{the band}} {{announced}} the <b>European</b> <b>headlining</b> dates, and later followed this up with announcements for both Asia and North America. The 101 dates announced represented a sizable increase from their debut tour a year earlier, {{primarily due to}} {{the addition of the}} Asian leg as well as new venues in Europe, the United States and Mexico. However, the band halved its Canadian appearances to only two shows; the band would not be revisiting any cities in Western Canada.|$|R
50|$|In spring 2006, Endstille {{embarked}} on a highly successful <b>European</b> tour <b>headlined</b> by Dark Funeral and Naglfar, and supported by Finnish death metal band Amoral.|$|R
