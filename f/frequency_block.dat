40|$|Image improvement, {{through the}} use of the Fourier {{transform}} property of lenses using various <b>frequency</b> <b>blocking</b> filters, was investigated to determine possible utilization of this technique to enhance low contrast fingerprint image characteristics. Ten basic fingerprint patterns were degraded in contrast and then used as the object t(x,y) in an optical spatial filtering setup. A series of <b>frequency</b> <b>blocking</b> filters were used in an effort to improve the degraded object image. Visual comparison of the filtered images obtained by using a double band <b>frequency</b> <b>blocking</b> filter, which produced the most satisfactory images, shows improved overall contrast. Random ridge enhancement was achieved, which varied from pattern to pattern, but at the same time, degradation also occurred randomly from smeared-out and blemished sections.

5|$|DAB radio {{stations}} in the United Kingdom are broadcast {{on a number of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> on VHF Band III. The original plan devised in Wiesbaden for the framework of DAB in Europe was to allocate <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> 11B to 12D for UK DAB broadcasting. However, as part of its Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for DAB and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10B to 10D and 11A. Block 5A has also been reserved for the launch of local ensembles. In 2015, additional blocks were opened up for small scale DAB trials for an initial period of nine months. Ofcom reitreated the use of a number of <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> between 7D and 9C for any future roll-out of small scale DAB multiplexes in its final report regarding the small scale DAB multiplexes published in September 2016.|$|R

5000|$|United Kingdom [...] ( [...] ITU Region 1 [...] ) The UK was {{allocated}} 11 <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> {{of varying}} bandwidths in January 2013. Full information {{is contained in}} the United Kingdom entry above.|$|R
50|$|Each {{region with}} access to digital radio {{has a number of}} multiplexes set aside for {{commercial}} and community radio services. In these multiplexes, two-ninths of the bandwidth are reserved for community broadcasters, while the rest is used for commercial broadcasters. Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane have been provided with two such multiplexes, which broadcast on frequency blocks 9A (202.928 MHz) and 9B (204.640 MHz), allowing a greater number of stations, while Adelaide and Perth currently have just one commercial/community multiplex each, both broadcasting on <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> 9B. Canberra has only one <b>frequency</b> <b>block,</b> 10B (211.648 MHz) which is shared with ABC and SBS, and Darwin's trial multiplex also broadcasts on <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> 10B.|$|E
50|$|The ABC and SBS operate {{digital radio}} {{services}} in all current DAB+ broadcasting markets on <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> 9C (206.352 MHz), While most services are national, the ABC provides the local ABC Local Radio station for their respective location.|$|E

50|$|Since the 500 MHz <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> (18.3-18.8 GHz) used by DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 on {{downlink}} {{were not}} intended for DBS broadcasting, existing equipment cannot receive them without a B-Band Converter (BBC). DirecTV supplies BBCs with all 5-LNB Ku/Ka-band dish systems.|$|E
50|$|The Radio <b>Frequency</b> <b>Block</b> sends and {{receives}} signals to/from portable devices (via the air interface) and converts between digital data and antenna signal.Some {{of the main}} functions are D/A and A/D conversion, up/down conversion, carrier selection, linear power amplification, diversity transmit and receive, RF combining and RF filtering.|$|E
50|$|IEEE 802.11n, however, {{can more}} than double the range. Range also varies with {{frequency}} band. Wi-Fi in the 2.4 GHz <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> has slightly better range than Wi-Fi in the 5 GHz <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> used by 802.11a (and optionally by 802.11n). On wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas which have higher gain in particular directions. Outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometers through the use of high gain directional antennas at the router and remote device(s). In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as FCC Part 15 in the US. Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 dBm (100 mW).|$|E

5|$|A future {{roll-out}} {{of small}} scale DAB multiplexes would be performed {{with a number}} of DAB <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks,</b> subject to business users migrating away from those frequencies and also subject to Parliamentary approval through the Broadcasting (Radio Multiplex Services) Bill 2016-17 which gained royal assent on April 27, 2017.

50|$|MXR West Midlands was a {{regional}} commercial digital radio multiplex in the United Kingdom, which served the West Midlands.

50|$|Canberra is {{not part}} of the {{official}} DAB+ rollout, but is part of the technical trials on regional broadcasting happening in Canberra and Darwin. In Canberra, where due to bandwidth limitations, only a subset of ABC and SBS stations are broadcast, on <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> 10B (211.648 MHz) - along with commercial stations.

50|$|Two new VHF, 9A and 12, {{have since}} been made {{available}} and are being used primarily for digital services (e.g. ABC in capital cities) but also for some new analogue services in regional areas.

40|$|Seasonal and interannual {{variations}} of blocking in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are discussed using 25 years of NCEP and 14 years of ECMWF data sets. Both {{the data sets}} show that the highest <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency</b> occurs near New Zealand, but ECMWF data seem to show higher <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency.</b> There are large interannual variations in <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency</b> over east and west Pacific, the principal regions of blocking in the SH. Linear correlation coefficients (CC) between the <b>frequency</b> of <b>blocking</b> and the Southern Oscillation Index show mostly negative values, indicating that blocking increases during the El Nino events. A significant value (at 95 % level) of CC is found only for the west Pacific in the austral autumn season. Two sets of three high and low <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency</b> years are selected to explore the possible causes for interannual variations. Mak's energy equations are {{used to examine the}} differences in energetics. To maximize the differences, two extreme years of blocking, a year of high <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency,</b> 1984, and a year of low <b>blocking</b> <b>frequency,</b> 1990, are considered. It is found that the generation of kinetic energy by barotropic processes on intraseasonal timescales is higher in 1984 than in 1990. This shows that the configuration of seasonal mean (deformation) field supports higher incidence of blocking in 1984 than in 1990. Pages: 4625 - 463...|$|R
50|$|The local {{oscillator}} frequency determines what block of incoming frequencies is downconverted to the frequencies expected by the receiver. For example, to downconvert the incoming signals from Astra 1KR, which transmits in a <b>frequency</b> <b>block</b> of 10.70-11.70 GHz, {{to within a}} standard European receiver's IF tuning range of 950-2,150 MHz, a 9.75 GHz {{local oscillator}} frequency is used, producing a block of signals in the band 950-1,950 MHz.|$|E

50|$|The 1850-1990 MHz PCS band {{is divided}} into six <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> (A through F). Each block is between 10 MHz and 30 MHz in bandwidth. License (A or B) is granted for Major Trading Areas (MTAs). License (C to F) is granted for Basic Trading Areas (BTAs). License (G), where issued, is granted for Economic Areas (EAs). There are 51 MTAs, 493 BTAs and 175 EAs in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, UK regulator, Ofcom, {{announced}} {{permission for}} 11 new <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks,</b> following representations from the RSGB and subsequent Ofcom {{discussions with the}} 'Primary User' of 5 MHz in the UK, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD). Although the MoD was unable to permit a continuous band, this allocation of seven channels was substantially increased to eleven frequency 'blocks' (or 'bandlets'), integrating the existing channels. These became active on 1 January 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Centre gap {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} of FDD-based frequency arrangement represented by the gap between <b>frequency</b> <b>blocks</b> assigned for downlink and uplink respectively in the FDD-based arrangement as illustrated in Figure 5.
