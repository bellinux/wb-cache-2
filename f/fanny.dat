5|$|Although Gilbert Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft lived {{together}} happily for brief periods {{before and after}} the birth of <b>Fanny,</b> he left Wollstonecraft in France {{in the midst of the}} Revolution. In an attempt to revive their relationship, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia on business for him, taking the one-year-old <b>Fanny</b> with her, but the affair never rekindled. After falling in love with and marrying Godwin, Wollstonecraft died soon after giving birth in 1797, leaving the three-year-old <b>Fanny</b> in the hands of Godwin, along with their newborn daughter Mary.|$|E

Little Annie <b>Fanny</b> is a humorous satire of contemporary American {{society and its}} sexual mores. Annie <b>Fanny,</b> the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.|$|E

When he refuses, she arranges to have his fortune transferred to his younger brother, Robert. On hearing this, Colonel Brandon offers Edward the parish on his estate, feeling sympathy for the unfortunate but honorable Edward.|$|E

A pretty miller's {{daughter}} of 18, Tilda puts up with <b>Fanny's</b> pettiness because of their childhood friendship but later breaks off their friendship after she realises the extent of <b>Fanny's</b> selfishness. She is rather coquettish but settles down happily with John Browdie.|$|R

5|$|On his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood {{tells his}} son {{from his first}} marriage, John, {{to take care of}} his second wife and three daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, since they will inherit nothing. John's greedy and snobbish wife <b>Fanny</b> convinces him to give his half sisters {{practically}} nothing financially; John and <b>Fanny</b> immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. <b>Fanny</b> invites her brother Edward Ferrars to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but <b>Fanny</b> haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from their travels, the Workmans lectured all over Europe. <b>Fanny</b> lectured in English, German, or French, as the occasion required. At one talk in Lyon, France, 1000 people {{crowded into the}} auditorium and 700 were turned away. In 1905 <b>Fanny</b> became the second woman to address the Royal Geographical Society. (Isabella Bird Bishop {{had been the first}} in May 1897.) Her talk was mentioned in The Times.|$|E

50|$|As sole {{executor}} of <b>Fanny's</b> will, Kent ordered a coffin, but fearful of being prosecuted should {{the nature of}} their relationship become known, asked that it remain nameless. On registering the burial he was, however, forced to give a name, and he gave her his own. <b>Fanny's</b> family was notified and her sister Ann Lynes, who lived nearby at Pall Mall, attended the funeral at St John's. When Ann learned of the terms of <b>Fanny's</b> will, which left her brothers and sisters half a crown each and Kent the rest, she tried but failed to block it in Doctors' Commons. The bulk of Kent's inheritance was <b>Fanny's</b> £150 share of her dead brother Thomas's estate. This also included some land owned by Thomas, sold by the executor of his estate, John Lynes, and Kent received <b>Fanny's</b> share of that too (almost £95). Her family resented this. Legal problems with Lynes's sale meant that each of Thomas's beneficiaries had to pay £45 in compensation to the purchaser, but Kent refused, claiming that he had already spent the money in settling <b>Fanny's</b> debts. In response to this, in October 1761 John Lynes began proceedings against Kent in the Court of Chancery. Meanwhile, Kent became a stockbroker and remarried in 1761.|$|R

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– <b>Fanny,</b> Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. <b>Fanny</b> became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} have a career in music, so <b>Fanny</b> remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, <b>Fanny</b> Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but <b>Fanny</b> Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and <b>Fanny</b> frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} he was sick and gout-ridden. He had surgery for gout, and his {{remaining}} friends, including novelist <b>Fanny</b> Burney (the daughter of Charles Burney), came to keep him company. He was confined to his room from 14 December 1783 to 21 April 1784.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} {{and his new}} wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from <b>Fanny</b> Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. <b>Fanny,</b> left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them every two weeks, and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left <b>Fanny</b> as his sole heir. In November 1986, <b>Fanny</b> closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Hergé was {{involved}} in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; she had to have a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named <b>Fanny</b> Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, {{with the rest of the}} studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for <b>Fanny,</b> but was also experiencing strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with <b>Fanny</b> to Germaine.|$|E
