There is, arguably, {{a limited amount of}} guidance in the CfE literature to advise and support secondary teachers in the practical implications of the planning, preparation and implementation of <b>interdisciplinary</b> learning and <b>teaching.</b> This paper examines this guidance and insights from research literature and presents the findings from a research project, Searching for Meaning, which focused on science and religious education teachers collaborating in planned <b>interdisciplinary</b> learning and <b>teaching</b> in secondary schools. The paper identifies some of the key factors for effective <b>interdisciplinary</b> learning and <b>teaching</b> between science and religious education. These include: support from the school leadership; openness to interdisciplinary work and willingness to learn about other disciplines; teamwork, dialogue and joint planning and the need for time and support for teachers. These findings are potentially significant for other forms of <b>interdisciplinary</b> learning and <b>teaching...</b>|$|R

50|$|One of the {{foremost}} scholars of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>teaching</b> techniques is James Beane, who advocates for curriculum integration, which is curriculum that is collaboratively designed around important issues. It has four major components: the integration of experiences, social integration, the integration of knowledge, and integration as a curriculum design. It differs from other types of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>teaching</b> in that {{it begins with a}} central theme that emerges from questions or social concerns students have, without regard to subject delineations (Beane, 1997).|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of Internet information technology, professional teaching softwares and simulation system {{are set up}} in higher vocational colleges.

To build a shared "interconnection ", professional and practical teaching platform is the urgent problem of college. Only by this, it can break through the limitation of the practice sites shortage, and promote the sharing of professional teaching resources. By using the virtualization and cloud computing technology, this paper constructs the <b>interdisciplinary</b> practical <b>teaching</b> platform under cloud environment, which can effectively solve the above problems in higher vocational colleges, thus to innovate the practical teaching mode. 1...|$|R
