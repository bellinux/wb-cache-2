40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the fault diagnosis problem in IP networks. We provide a lower bound {{on the average}} number of probes per edge using variational <b>inference</b> <b>technique</b> proposed in the context of graphical models under noisy probe measurements. To obtain the bounds, we construct a graphical model using Bayesian networks. The advantages of the variational <b>inference</b> <b>technique</b> are the explicit choices of a simplifying conjugate function and a computationally tolerable approximation to address the intractable detection problem for large networks. We propose an entropy lower (EL) bound by drawing similarities between the coding problem over binary symmetric channel and the diagnosis problem and compare it against the variational lower bound. In addition, we discuss scalable and non-scalable scenarios in the presence of noise. Simulation results demonstrate that indeed the variational <b>inference</b> <b>technique</b> can provide a linear growth of {{the average number of}} probes per edge {{as a function of the}} network size. 1...|$|E

40|$|Sudoku is a {{very simple}} and {{well-known}} puzzle that has achieved international popularity in the recent past. This paper addresses the problem of encoding Sudoku puzzles into conjunctive normal form (CNF), and subsequently solving them using polynomial-time propositional satisfiability (SAT) <b>inference</b> <b>techniques.</b> We introduce two straightforward SAT encodings for Sudoku: the minimal encoding and the extended encoding. The minimal encoding suffices to characterize Sudoku puzzles, whereas the extended encoding adds redundant clauses to the minimal encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that, for thousands of very hard puzzles, <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> struggle to solve these puzzles when using the minimal encoding. However, using the extended encoding, unit propagation is able to solve about half of our set of puzzles. Nonetheless, for some puzzles more sophisticated <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> are required. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceContext: Finite State Machine (FSM) {{inference}} from execution traces {{has received}} a lot of attention over the past few years. Various approaches have been explored, each holding different properties for the resulting models, but the lack of standard benchmarks limits the ability of comparing the proposed techniques. Evaluation is usually performed on a few case studies, which is useful for assessing the feasibility of the algorithm on particular cases, but fails to demonstrate effectiveness in a broad context. Consequently, understanding {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> remains a challenging task. Objective: This paper proposes CARE, a general, approach-independent, platform for the intensive evaluation of FSM <b>inference</b> <b>techniques.</b> Method: Grounded in a program specification scheme that provides a good control on the expected program structures, it allows the production of large benchmarks with well identified properties. Results: The CARE platform demonstrates the following features: (1) providing a benchmarking mechanism for FSM <b>inference</b> <b>techniques,</b> (2) allowing analysis of existing techniques w. r. t. a class of programs and/or behaviors, and (3) helping users in choosing the best suited approach for their objective. Moreover, our extensive experiments on different FSM <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> highlight that they do not behave in the same manner on every class of program. Characterizing different classes of programs thus helps understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the studied techniques. Conclusion: Experiments reported in this paper show examples of use cases that demonstrate the ability of the platform to generate large and diverse sets of programs, which allows to carry out meaningful <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> analysis. The analysis strategies the CARE platform offers open new opportunities for program behavior learning, particularly in conjunction with model checking techniques.

For this purpose, 90 female learners attending the Jahad Daneshgahi Center in Qom took a piloted sample KET test, 60 of whom were selected as homogenous learners. They were randomly divided into two experimental groups-one learning new vocabulary items through lexical translation technique and the other with the lexical <b>inferencing</b> <b>technique.</b> They were given a pre-test on vocabulary to ensure that the participants had no prior knowledge of the target words.

40|$|Many {{theories}} of human cognition postulate {{that people are}} equipped with a repertoire of strategies to solve the tasks they face. This theoretical framework of a cognitive toolbox provides a plausible account of intra- and interindividual differences in human behavior. Unfortunately, it is often unclear how to rigorously test the toolbox framework. How can a toolbox model be quantitatively specified? How can the number of toolbox strategies be limited to prevent uncontrolled strategy sprawl? How can a toolbox model be formally tested against alternative theories? The authors show how these challenges can be met by using Bayesian <b>inference</b> <b>techniques.</b> By means of parameter recovery simulations and the analysis of empirical data {{across a variety of}} domains (i. e., judgment and decision making, children's cognitive development, function learning, and perceptual categorization), the authors illustrate how Bayesian <b>inference</b> <b>techniques</b> allow toolbox models to be quantitatively specified, strategy sprawl to be contained, and toolbox models to be rigorously tested against competing theories.
