The purpose of this investigation is to increase the understanding of how <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> affect project performance. A procurement model including eight hypotheses is first developed {{on the basis of a}} literature review and then tested through multivariate statistical techniques based on empirical data collected through a survey investigation of 106 Swedish construction clients. The results of hierarchical regression analyses show that cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> positively affect collaboration among project actors and that collaboration in turn have positive effects on project performance. In general, however, cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> do not have direct effects on project performance. Godkänd; 2009; 20091005 (andwan...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, {{public works}} are {{contracted}} {{more and more}} in integrated ways. In recent literature, it is argued that <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> will influence project performance. Even more, the procurement climate itself is found to influence the project performance by strengthening or altering the relationship between <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure</b> and project performance. In this paper, the relationship between <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> and 9 ̆ 6 climate and project cooperation is defined, project cooperation being an important indicator for project performance. The results of the literature study and the qualitative survey show a clear need for a <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure</b> not merely based on the project itself, but also on collaboration and soft parameters. In-depth case studies are used to analyze abovementioned relationships and find more detailed descriptions. The <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure,</b> <b>procurement</b> climate and project cooperation of three projects were assessed: KOSMOS STAKAN, 2 nd Coen Tunnel, Houten-Castellum alliance. The added value of a collaborative procurement climate is emphasized by the in-depth case study results. Based on those results, suggestions for further research are given...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the implementation of <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the King William’s Town Education District. In spite of {{the provisions of the}} Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996 and Public Finance Management Act No 1 of 1999 (PFMA), in respect of the provision of services, procurement in the King William’s Town Education District is flawed. The study explored the legislative framework governing <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the District, the extent of compliance and non compliance with <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> and the causes of flawed <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> A descriptive case study was used to describe, analyse and interpret a particular phenomenon, in this case the <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> in the King William’s Town Education District. Purposive sampling was chosen for this study to create an understanding of the research problem, and to complement the case study method in eliminating any potential bias in the data. Respondents included mainly the managers in the District, who are instrumental in the implementation of procurement processes in the District. Self administered interviewing schedules were used for respondents to answer without the assistance of the researcher. The study found out that the District was lagging behind in respect of compliance to <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> monitoring and evaluation, and accountability. Based on the above findings, the study recommended the following: (a) strengthening accountability in all managers and public servants, (b) professional training and education of personnel and managers {{in order to be able}} to implement procurement processes, (c) establishment of compliance office, (d) introduction of complaints mechanisms, and (e) effecting monitoring and control mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> do {{not always}} proceed {{according}} to the rules. Entrepreneurs who miss a contract because of a fault of the contracting entity can go to court. In this field {{there have been two}} directives adopted {{at the level of the}} European Union that sets preconditions to the national legal systems of Member States. Arthur van Heeswijck has examined the conformity of the Dutch system of legal protection of entrepreneurs in <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> with European law and the consistency of those rules. The Dutch system of legal protection is broadly in line with European law, but the Public Procurement Act 2012 contains a number of gaps. For example, contracting authorities are under the EU Procurement Directives obliged to motivate the decision to withdraw a <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure.</b> This obligation has not been implemented in the Public Procurement Act 2012. In some cases, entrepreneurs are entitled to reimbursement of the tender costs, if the contracting authority has made a mistake. The Dutch legislation lacks this provision. The cohesion of the Dutch system of judicial can be improved too. For example, in European <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> contracting authorities are obliged to keep documents which have been received from tenderers confidential. Without justification, a similar provision lacks for national <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> A provision for confidentiality should be laid down in the general part of the Public Procurement Act 2012, which is applicable to all documents, regardless of the nature of the procedure...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative arrangements, such as partnering, have {{received}} {{increased interest in}} recent years. Several studies show however that cooperative relationships are not easily achieved in construction. Implementation of cooperative relationships requires changes in several elements of the traditional <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is therefore to propose and test a sequential model regarding clients' cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> We especially ask: what elements in clients' <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> facilitate the establishment of cooperation and trust in their relationships with contractors? The model was tested through structural equation modelling. The empirical data required for the test were collected through a survey responded to by 87 Swedish professional construction clients. The empirical results show that cooperative <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> are triggered by clients' wish to involve contractors early in specification, which has a simultaneous effect on procedures regarding bid invitation and compensation. Furthermore, these simultaneous effects breed a certain kind of partner selection based on task-related attributes, which also has a direct positive effect on trust and above all on cooperation in client-contractor relationships. Besides these implications from the model, the improvement of measurements for future modelling is discussed. Cooperation, partnering, procurement, SEM,...|$|R

Public procurement is at the forefront of most reform efforts given that it plays a significant role in promoting accountability and transparency. This study relies on survey data of procurement professionals to delineate the current status of <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure</b> in Kenya. Findings suggest that <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> as enshrined in the public procurement and disposal act has not yet led to significant transformative changes. Unethical practices, weak legislations and penalty and failure to educate the general public on the dangers of corruption were identified as the primary obstacles of effectively implementing <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure.</b> These findings suggest that in order to enhance quality service delivery, top leadership of the country, policymakers, procurement professionals and general public must {{take an active role in}} adoption of the processes across political, institutional and behavioral domains.
