40|$|In this {{technical}} note we provide data {{useful for the}} clinical application of the target-induced Natural Killer (NK) loss (TINKL) assay. The TINKL assay is a sensitive flow cytometry-based assay for measuring NK cell function. Loss of NK cells from the lymphocyte gate occurs following culture with K 562 (the prototypic target cell <b>for</b> natural <b>killing)</b> and antibody-coated target cells (<b>for</b> antibody-dependent <b>killing).</b> By analysis of multiple samples of PBMC from single donors we document the intra-experimental variability and the inter-experimental variability of the assay. The intra-experimental coefficient of variation (CV) was on average 11 % <b>for</b> natural <b>killing</b> and 3 % <b>for</b> antibody-dependent <b>killing,</b> compared to 14 % and 9 % respectively for the inter-experimental variation. Analysis of a 123 normal healthy adults shows large variability in the functional capacity of NK cells in the population both <b>for</b> natural <b>killing</b> (CV 33 %) and antibody-dependent killing (CV 27 %) ...|$|R
