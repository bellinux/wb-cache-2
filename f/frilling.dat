6000|$|Then I {{would draw}} their {{attention}} to the fresh beauties that kept sweeping into view, and they would glance round and say [...] "charming," [...] "sweetly pretty," [...] and immediately go off into raptures over each other's pocket-handkerchiefs, and mourn with one another over the decadence of cambric <b>frilling.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{considering}} {{only its}} type material, Medusaceratops is unique among Chasmosaurinae in having only three epi-parietals (<b>frill</b> spikes) on each {{half of the}} <b>frill.</b> The first <b>frill</b> spike pair is large {{and the second is}} smaller, and both are uniquely widened at base, pachyostotic, curve down the sides of the <b>frill,</b> and are depressed down the front of the <b>frill.</b> The third <b>frill</b> spike pair is small and triangular, unmodified in comparison to other early chasmosaurine, but similarly depressed, and is bordering to the squamosal bone. The highly broadened and curved first <b>frill</b> spike pair of Medusaceratops closely resembles the third pair of the <b>frill</b> ornamentation of Albertaceratops, however Medusaceratops (and all chasmosaurines) differs in lacking tab-shaped, frequently overlapping fourth to seventh pairs of the <b>frill</b> ornamentation of centrosaurines.|$|R
50|$|The {{bones of}} the <b>frill</b> are {{modified}} elongate hyoid types that form rods which expand the <b>frill.</b> Secondarily the <b>frill</b> {{can serve as a}} form of camouflage when relaxed; there is no standard coloration to the body, but it is usually darker than the <b>frill.</b>|$|R
25|$|Protoceratops was a quadrupedal dinosaur {{that was}} {{partially}} characterized by its distinctive neck <b>frill</b> {{at the back}} of its skull. The <b>frill</b> itself contained two large parietal fenestrae (holes in the <b>frill),</b> while its cheeks had large jugal bones. The exact size and shape of the neck <b>frill</b> varied by individual; some specimens had short, compact <b>frills,</b> while others had <b>frills</b> nearly half the length of the skull. The <b>frill</b> consists mostly of the parietal bone and partially of the squamosal. Some researchers, including Peter Dodson attribute the different sizes and shapes of these bones to sexual dimorphism, as well as the age of the specimen, at the time of death.|$|R
60|$|Her fingers {{went back}} to the <b>frilling,</b> and she turned her head sullenly away from me. I had been met in this manner, in the course of plying the good work, {{hundreds}} of times. She merely stimulated me to try again. In my dauntless zeal for her welfare, I ran the great risk, and openly alluded to her marriage engagement.|$|E

Mary Garth might do some work for me now, I should think. Her sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I know about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric <b>frilling</b> double-hemmed. And it takes a long time." ...|$|E

No question of marriage seemed to be disturbing the mind of this juvenile husband of hers. The primum mobile of his gravitation was apparently the equatorial telescope which she had given him, and which he was carefully adjusting by means of screws and clamps. Hearing her movements he turned his head.|$|E

50|$|It is the {{precursor}} breed {{from which the}} modern Oriental <b>Frill</b> was created via selective breeding methods. The Old Fashioned or Original Hünkari (Oriental <b>Frill)</b> possess less exaggerated features unlike the Oriental <b>Frill</b> of today. They can still feed their own young, called squabs, by regurgitation, because their beaks have not been bred down to such an extremely short and blunt shape as in the new style show birds. There is therefore no need for foster feeders, of another long-beaked breed, such as homers, to feed the Classic Oriental <b>Frill</b> squabs. The old style Hünkari (Oriental <b>Frill)</b> is still a good flyer as it is not bred in larger sizes.|$|R

[...] "If it had been Miss Verinder's nightgown, {{she would have had}} to buy lace, and <b>frilling,</b> and Lord knows what besides; and she wouldn't have had time to make it in one night. Plain long cloth means a plain servant's nightgown. No, no, Mr. Betteredge--all that is clear enough. The pinch of the question is--why, after having provided the substitute dress, does she hide the smeared nightgown, instead of destroying it? If the girl won't speak out, {{there is only one way}} of settling the difficulty. The hiding-place at the Shivering Sand must be searched--and the true state of the case will be discovered there." ...|$|E
60|$|When her {{cup of tea}} went up to her {{the next}} morning, I {{followed}} it in. I sat by her bedside and said a few earnest words. She listened with languid civility. I noticed my serious friend's precious publications huddled together {{on a table in}} a corner. Had she chanced to look into them?--I asked. Yes--and they had not interested her. Would she allow me to read a few passages of the deepest interest, which had probably escaped her eye? No, not now--she had other things to think of. She gave these answers, with her attention apparently absorbed in folding and refolding the <b>frilling</b> on her nightgown. It was plainly necessary to rouse her by some reference to those worldly interests which she still had at heart.|$|E
60|$|She {{was about}} eight-and-twenty, with large bones, large features, large feet and hands, large eyes and no hair. Her large eyes were limpid and almost colourless; {{they seemed to}} be very little {{affected}} by light, and to stand unnaturally still. There was also that attentive listening expression in her face, which is seen in the faces of the blind; but she was not blind, having one tolerably serviceable eye. Her face was not exceedingly ugly, though it was only redeemed from being so by a smile; a good-humoured smile, and pleasant in itself, but rendered pitiable by being constantly there. A great white cap, with a quantity of opaque <b>frilling</b> that was always flapping about, apologised for Maggy's baldness, and made it so very difficult for her old black bonnet to retain its place upon her head, that it held on round her neck like a gipsy's baby. A commission of haberdashers could alone have reported what the rest of her poor dress was made of, but it had a strong general resemblance to seaweed, with here and there a gigantic tea-leaf. Her shawl looked particularly like a tea-leaf after long infusion.|$|E

Originally, the No <b>Frills</b> brand was only used for its peanut butter, honey and potato chips but expanded its range to more than 800 products in packaged groceries and perishables.|$|R
50|$|A neck <b>frill</b> is the {{relatively}} extensive margin {{seen on the}} back of the heads of reptiles with either a bony support such as those present on the skulls of dinosaurs of the suborder Marginocephalia or a cartilaginous one as in the frill-necked lizard. In technical terms, the bone-supported <b>frill</b> is composed of an enlarged parietal bone flanked by elongated squamosals and sometimes ringed by epoccipitals, bony knobs that gave the margin a jagged appearance. In the early 1900s, the parietal bone was known among paleontologists as the dermosupraoccipital. In some genera, such as Triceratops, Pentaceratops, Centrosaurus and Torosaurus, this extension is very large. Despite the neck <b>frill</b> predominantly being made of hard bone, some neck <b>frills</b> are made of skin, as is the case with the frill-necked lizard of today that resides in Australia. The use of the neck <b>frill</b> in dinosaurs is uncertain; it may have been used for thermoregulation or simply as a defense mechanism. Indeed, during battles for territory, competing Triceratops crashed heads together with their elongated horns and the neck <b>frill</b> may have been employed as a kind of shield, protecting the rest of the animal from harm. However, usage of the neck <b>frill</b> in modern reptiles is better documented. Two chief and disparate examples are the horned lizards (genus Phrynosoma) with a bony <b>frill,</b> and the frill-necked lizard (genus Chlamydosaurus) with a cartilaginous <b>frill.</b> The frill-necked lizard's <b>frill</b> is mainly made up of flaps of skin, which are usually coloured pink, supported by cartilaginous spines. Similar to the portrayal of the dinosaur Dilophosaurus in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, frill-necked lizard puff out these neck <b>frills</b> on either side of its head when threatened. The lizards often raise their <b>frills</b> when battling for territory or when coming into contact with another lizard, especially during mating season. There is, however, no evidence that suggests that Dilophosaurus neither had nor didn't have the same abilities, as many of its features in the Jurassic Park film were mostly fictional.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{had a case}} {{some little}} time ago which {{was out of the}} ordinary," [...] says the surgeon. [...] "There was a famous beauty in London Society--I mention no names--who used to be {{remarkable}} a few seasons ago for the very low dresses which she would wear. She had the whitest of skins, and most beautiful of shoulders, so it was no wonder. Then gradually the <b>frilling</b> at her neck lapped upwards and upwards, until last year she astonished every one by wearing quite a high collar {{at a time when it}} was completely out of fashion. Well, one day this very woman was shown into my consulting-room. When the footman was gone she suddenly tore off the upper part of her dress. 'For God's sake do something for me!' she cried. Then I saw what the trouble was. A rodent ulcer was eating its way upwards, coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of it was flush with her collar. The red streak of its trail was lost below the line of her bust. Year by year it had ascended and she had heightened her dress to hide it, until now it was about to invade her face. She had been too proud to confess her trouble, even to a medical man." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Thorpe {{arrived with}} her two little girls, the neatest of creatures, still wearing her weeds, as indeed widows engaged in any {{business}} used to do for life {{as a sort of}} protection. Under her crape borders showed the smoothest of hair, and her apron was spotlessly white. The two little girls were patterns, with short cut hair, spotted blue frocks and checkered pinafores in the week, lilac frocks on Sundays; white capes on that same day, and bonnets of coarse straw, tied down with green ribbon, over little bonnet caps with plain net <b>frilling,</b> the only attempt at luxury apparent in their dress. Their names were Jane and Mary, and they looked very pretty and demure, though there was a little mischief in Mary's eyes. Nothing could look nicer or more promising {{in the eyes of the}} sisters when they took her to her cottage, nor could any one be better pleased than she to work under her own young ladies, and to have so peaceful a home for her little daughters. She was introduced to her future scholars on Sunday in the wash-house, and very shy and awkward did they look, nor were the numbers as large as usual.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was dressed}} with an exquisitely {{expressive}} economy of outlay. The plainest straw bonnet procurable, trimmed sparingly with the cheapest white ribbon, {{was on her}} head. Modest and tasteful poverty expressed itself in the speckless cleanliness and the modestly proportioned skirts of her light [...] "print" [...] gown, and in the scanty little mantilla of cheap black silk which she wore over it, edged with a simple <b>frilling</b> of the same material. The luster of her terrible red hair showed itself unshrinkingly in a plaited coronet above her forehead, and escaped in one vagrant love-lock, perfectly curled, that dropped over her left shoulder. Her gloves, fitting her like a second skin, were of the sober brown hue which is slowest {{to show signs of}} use. One hand lifted her dress daintily above the impurities of the road; the other held a little nosegay of the commonest garden flowers. Noiselessly and smoothly she came on, with a gentle and regular undulation of the print gown; with the love-lock softly lifted from moment to moment in the evening breeze; with her head a little drooped, and her eyes on the ground--in walk, and look, and manner, in every casual movement that escaped her, expressing that subtle mixture of the voluptuous and the modest which, of the many attractive extremes that meet in women, is in a man's eyes the most irresistible of all.|$|E

60|$|So if Mrs. Glegg's front to-day {{was more}} fuzzy and lax than usual, {{she had a}} design under it: she {{intended}} the most pointed and cutting allusion to Mrs. Tulliver's bunches of blond curls, separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness {{on each side of}} the parting. Mrs. Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg's unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered support. Mrs. Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house to-day,--untied and tilted slightly, of course--a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit, and happened to be in a severe humor: she didn't know what draughts there might be in strange houses. For the same reason she wore a small sable tippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and was very far from meeting across her well-formed chest, while her long neck was protected by a chevaux-de-frise of miscellaneous <b>frilling.</b> One would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them Mrs. Glegg's slate-colored silk gown must have been; but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear.|$|E
60|$|Lydgate {{was late}} in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other surgeons, {{and several of the}} {{directors}} had arrived early; Mr. Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still absent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had been generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred in action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him {{as if he had been}} a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is probable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas of <b>frilling</b> and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted; conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of judgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general presumption against his medical skill.|$|E
60|$|Maggy sat at {{her work}} in her great white cap with its {{quantity}} of opaque <b>frilling</b> hiding what profile she had (she had none to spare), and her serviceable eye brought to bear upon her occupation, on the window side of the room. What with her flapping cap, and what with her unserviceable eye, she was quite partitioned off from her Little Mother, whose seat was opposite the window. The tread and shuffle of feet on the pavement of the yard had much diminished since the taking of the Chair, the tide of Collegians having set strongly {{in the direction of}} Harmony. Some few who had no music in their souls, or no money in their pockets, dawdled about; and the old spectacle of the visitor-wife and the depressed unseasoned prisoner still lingered in corners, as broken cobwebs and such unsightly discomforts draggle in corners of other places. It was the quietest time the College knew, saving the night hours when the Collegians took the benefit of the act of sleep. The occasional rattle of applause upon the tables of the Snuggery, denoted the successful termination of a morsel of Harmony; or the responsive acceptance, by the united children, of some toast or sentiment offered to them by their Father. Occasionally, a vocal strain more sonorous than the generality informed the listener that some boastful bass was in blue water, or in the hunting field, or with the reindeer, or on the mountain, or among the heather; but the Marshal of the Marshalsea knew better, and had got him hard and fast.|$|E

The Ceratopsinae or Chasmosaurinae are generally characterized by long, triangular <b>frills</b> and well-developed brow horns.

6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a {{consignment}} of Celebros every month or two since then, and, dispose of them quietly as I may, they are accumulating in the cupboard. I despise myself; but my guile was kindly meant at first, and every thoughtful man will see the difficulties {{in the way of}} a confession now. Who can say what might happen if I were to fling that cupboard door open in presence of my wife? I smoke less than I used to do; for if I were to buy my cigars by the box I could not get them smuggled into the house. Besides, she would know--I don't say how, I merely make the statement--that I had been buying cigars. So I get half a dozen at a time. Perhaps you will sympathize with me when I say that I have had to abandon my favorite brand. I cannot get Villar y Villars that look like Celebros, and my wife is quicker in those matters than she used to be. One day, for instance, she noticed that the cigars in my case had not the gold ribbon round them, and I almost fancied she became suspicious. I explained that the ribbon was perhaps a little ostentatious; but she said it was an intimation of nutty flavor: and now I take ribbons off the Celebros and put them on the other cigars. The boxes in which the Celebros arrive have a picturesque design on the lid and a good deal of lace <b>frilling</b> round the edge, and she likes to have a box lying about. The top layer of that box is cigars in gold ribbons, placed there by myself, and underneath are the Celebros. I never get down to the Celebros.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dosson made no {{observation}} whatever {{about their}} grave bland visitor; he listened in genial unprejudiced silence. It {{was a sign}} of his prospective son-in-law's perfect comprehension of him that Gaston knew this silence not to be in any degree restrictive: it didn't at all mean he hadn't been pleased. Mr. Dosson had nothing to say because nothing had been given him; he hadn't, like his so differently-appointed young friend, a sensitive plate for a brain, and the important events of his life had never been personal impressions. His mind had had absolutely no history with which anything occurring in the present connexion could be continuous, and Mr. Probert's appearance had neither founded a state nor produced a revolution. If the young man had asked him how he liked his father he would have said at the most: [...] "Oh I guess he's all right!" [...] But what was more touchingly candid even than this in Gaston's view was the attitude of the good gentleman and his daughters toward the others, Mesdames de Douves, de Brecourt and de Cliche and their husbands, who had now all filed before them. They believed the ladies and the gentlemen alike to have covered them with frank endearments, to have been artlessly and gushingly glad to make their acquaintance. They had not in the least seen what was manner, the minimum of decent profession, and what the subtle resignation of old races who have known a long historical discipline and have conventional forms and tortuous channels and grimacing masks for their impulses--forms resembling singularly little the feelings themselves. Francie took people at their word when they told her that the whole maniere d'etre of her family inspired them with an irresistible sympathy: that was a speech of which Mme. de Cliche had been capable, speaking as if for all the Proberts and for the old noblesse of France. It wouldn't have occurred to the girl that such things need have been said as for mere <b>frilling</b> and finish. Her lover, whose life affected her as a picture, of high price in itself but set in a frame too big and too heavy for it, and who therefore might have taken for granted any amount of gilding, yet made his reflexions on it now; he noticed how a manner might be a very misleading symbol, might cover pitfalls and bottomless gulfs, when it had reached that perfection and corresponded so little to fact. What he had wanted was that his people should be as easy as they could see their way to being, but with such a high standard of compliment where after all was sincerity? And without sincerity how could people get on together when it came to their settling down to common life? Then the Dossons might have surprises, and the surprises would be painful in proportion as their present innocence was great. As to the high standard itself there was no manner of doubt: there ought to be preserved examples of that perfection.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Garth {{was not at}} the office, and Fred rode on to his house, {{which was}} a little way outside the town--a homely place with an orchard in front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now {{surrounded}} with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends have. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had four brothers and one sister, were very fond of their old house, from which all the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant expectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom he was rather more in awe than of her husband. Not that she was inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her present matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by over-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth, and learned self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what is unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her husband's virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences cheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in teapots or children's <b>frilling,</b> and had never poured any pathetic confidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr. Garth's want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been like other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or eccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as [...] "your fine Mrs. Garth." [...] She was not without her criticism of them in return, being more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and--where is the blameless woman?--apt to be a little severe towards her own sex, which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the other hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her resistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her consciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent were above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family dinner, and darned all the stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in a peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with their book or slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could make an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders [...] "without looking,"--that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone--that, in short, she might possess [...] "education" [...] and other good things ending in [...] "tion," [...] and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a useless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a firm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from looking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary Mrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin.|$|E
2500|$|The large <b>frills</b> and nasal {{horns of}} the ceratopsians {{are among the}} most {{distinctive}} facial adornments of all dinosaurs.
