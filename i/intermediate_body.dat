60|$|It is of {{no avail}} to say that such a {{delegated}} body can not have all the requisites of good government; above all, can not have that complete and over-operative identity of interest with the governed which {{it is so difficult}} to obtain even where the people to be ruled are in some degree qualified to look after their own affairs. Real good government is not compatible with the conditions of the case. There is but a choice of imperfections. The problem is, so to construct the governing body that, under the difficulties of the position, it shall have as much interest as possible in good government, and as little in bad. Now these conditions are best found in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>body.</b> A delegated administration has always this advantage over a direct one, that it has, at all events, no duty to perform except to the governed. It has no interests to consider except theirs. Its own power of deriving profit from misgovernment may be reduced--in the latest Constitution of the East India Company it was reduced--to a singularly small amount; and it can be kept entirely clear of bias from the individual or class interests of any one else. When the home government and Parliament are swayed by such partial influences in the exercise of the power reserved to them in the last resort, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>body</b> is the certain advocate and champion of the dependency before the imperial tribunal. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>body,</b> moreover, is, in the natural course of things, chiefly composed of persons who have acquired professional knowledge of this part of their country's concerns; who have been trained to it in the place itself, and have made its administration the main occupation of their lives. Furnished with these qualifications, and not being liable to lose their office from the accidents of home politics, they identify their character and consideration with their special trust, and have a much more permanent interest in the success of their administration, and in the prosperity of the country which they administer, than a member of a cabinet under a representative constitution can possibly have in the good government of any country except the one which he serves. So far as the choice of those who carry on the management on the spot devolves upon this body, their appointment is kept out of the vortex of party and Parliamentary jobbing, and freed from the influence of those motives to the abuse of patronage for the reward of adherents, or to buy off those who would otherwise be opponents, which are always stronger with statesmen of average honesty than a conscientious sense of the duty of appointing the fittest man. To put this one class of appointments as far as possible out of harm's way is of more consequence than the worst which can happen to all other offices in the state; for, in every other department, if the officer is unqualified, the general opinion of the community directs him in a certain degree what to do; but in the position of the administrators of a dependency where the people are not fit to have the control in their own hands, the character of the government entirely depends on the qualifications, moral and intellectual, of the individual functionaries.|$|E

60|$|In some {{representative}} constitutions, {{the plan has}} been adopted of choosing {{the members of the}} representative body by a double process, the primary electors only choosing other electors, and these electing the member of Parliament. This contrivance was probably intended as a slight impediment to the full sweep of popular feeling, giving the suffrage, and with it the complete ultimate power, to the Many, but compelling them to exercise it through the agency of a comparatively few, who, it was supposed, would be less moved than the Demos by the gusts of popular passion; and as the electors, being already a select body, might be expected to exceed in intellect and character the common level of their constituents, the choice made by them was thought likely to be more careful and enlightened, and would, in any case, be made under a greater feeling of responsibility than election by the masses themselves. This plan of filtering, as it were, the popular suffrage through an <b>intermediate</b> <b>body</b> admits of a very plausible defense; since it may be said, with great appearance of reason, that less intellect and instruction are required for judging who among our neighbors can be most safely trusted to choose a member of Parliament than who is himself fittest to be one.|$|E
60|$|It {{is in no}} way unjust {{that public}} {{officers}} thus selected and trained should be exclusively eligible to offices which require specially Indian knowledge and experience. If any door to the higher appointments, without passing through the lower, be opened even for occasional use, there will be such incessant knocking at it by persons of influence that it will be impossible ever to keep it closed. The only excepted appointment should be the highest one of all. The Viceroy of British India should be a person selected from all Englishmen for his great general capacity for government. If he have this, {{he will be able to}} distinguish in others, and turn to his own use, that special knowledge and judgment in local affairs which he has not himself had the opportunity of acquiring. There are good reasons why the viceroy should not be a member of the regular service. All services have, more or less, their class prejudices, from which the supreme ruler ought to be exempt. Neither are men, however able and experienced, who have passed their lives in Asia, so likely to possess the most advanced European ideas in general statesmanship, which the chief ruler should carry out with him, and blend with the results of Indian experience. Again, being of a different class, and especially if chosen by a different authority, he will seldom have any personal partialities to warp his appointments to office. This great security for honest bestowal of patronage existed in rare perfection under the mixed government of the crown and the East India Company. The supreme dispensers of office--the governor general and governors--were appointed, in fact though not formally, by the crown, that is, by the general government, not by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>body,</b> and a great officer of the crown probably had not a single personal or political connection in the local service, while the delegated body, most of whom had themselves served in the country, had, and were likely to have, such connections. This guaranty for impartiality would be much impaired if the civil servants of government, even though sent out in boyhood as mere candidates for employment, should come to be furnished, in any considerable proportion, by the class of society which supplies viceroys and governors. Even the initiatory competitive examination would then be an insufficient security. It would exclude mere ignorance and incapacity; it would compel youths of family to start in the race with the same amount of instruction and ability as other people; the stupidest son could not be put into the Indian service, as he can be into the Church; but there would be nothing to prevent undue preference afterwards. No longer, all equally unknown and unheard of by the arbiter of their lot, a portion of the service would be personally, and a still greater number politically, in close relation with him. Members of certain families, and of the higher classes and influential connections generally, would rise more rapidly than their competitors, and be often kept in situations for which they were unfit, or placed in those for which others were fitter. The same influences would be brought into play which affect promotions in the army; and those alone, if such miracles of simplicity there be, who believe that these are impartial, would expect impartiality in those of India. This evil is, I fear, irremediable by any general measures which can be taken under the present system. No such will afford a degree of security comparable to that which once flowed spontaneously from the so-called double government.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a general {{framework for the}} manual teleoperation of kinematically redundant space-based manipulators. It is proposed {{to break down the}} task of controlling the motion of a redundant manipulator into a sequence of manageable sub-tasks of lower dimension by imposing constraints on the motion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> of the manipulator. This implies that the manipulator then becomes a non-redundant kinematic chain and the operator only controls a reduced number of degrees of freedom at any time. However, by appropriately changing the imposed constraints, the operator can use the full capability of the manipulator throughout the task. Also, by not restricting the point of teleoperation to the end effector but effectively allowing direct control of <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> of the robot, it is possible to teleoperate a redundant robot of arbitrary kinematic architecture over its entire configuration space in a predictable and natural fashion. It is rigourously proven that this approach will always work for any kinematically redundant serial manipulator regardless of its topology, geometry and of the number of its excess degrees-of-freedom. Furthermore, a methodology is provided for the selection of task and constraint coordinates to ensure the absence of algorithmic rank-deficiencies. Two novel algorithms are provided for the symbolic determination of the rank-deficiency locus of rectangular Jacobian matrices: the Singular Vector Algorithm and the Recursive Sub-Determinant Algorithm. These algorithms are complementary to each other: the former being more computationally efficient and the latter more robust. The application of the methodology to sample cases of varying complexity has demonstrated its power and limitations: It {{has been shown to be}} powerful enough to generate complete sets of task/constraint coordinate pairs for realistic examples such as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System and a simplified version of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator...|$|R
