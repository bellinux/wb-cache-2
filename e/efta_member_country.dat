40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{problems facing}} electronic legislation development (especially legislation processes of publishing acts) in EU and <b>EFTA</b> <b>member</b> <b>countries.</b> All European countries were publishing acts officially on paper {{until the end}} of year 2000. The way of publishing acts officially was the same in all Europe countries, except that some counties had one “official journal” in which legal acts and other official documents and legal notices were published, and other countries had separate legal gazettes for acts publishing and an official gazette for publishing other official documents and legal notices. At the beginning of 2001 Norway started to publish acts officially in digital form, and only 12 - 20 times a year paper editions to present the statutes and regulations enacted since the publication of the previous issue are published. In 2002 Estonia decided to finish the publishing of paper editions, and started to publish acts only electronically. Till 2011 more than 10 European countries started to publish acts officially in digital format. Author discusses the advantages, principles, and legitimate expectation of electronic legislation. For future electronic legislation information systems developments the following principles should be a guide: broad/universal and equal access to legislation, reliability of the means of publicity, integrity of information, easy access to the requisite information. The advantages of digital act forms, and internet based publications are instantaneous outreach to the public, free of charge, information easily accessible and retrievable, voluminous technical acts easier to handle, no printing costs, more environmentally-friendly, more and more people use ICT to seek information, no time constraints to the availability of data, legal certainty will be granted. The author thinks that before creating future digital legislation information systems, some procedures shall be done. If we want to have pan-European information systems of legislation, EU should adopt standards for better information exchange, and for legislation process unification. The author thinks that non-consolidated versions of law acts are old fashioned, and are not suitable for modern digital legislation. Countries should change procedures of legislation, only consolidated versions of acts would be adopted, used and officially recognized. The article talks about technical issues of digital legislation information systems, legal XML, semantic search, Web 2. 0. (for example: user comments) and Web 3. 0. (for example: user rankings, other possible search) and artificial intelligence technologies shall be used. Author focus also is on an interesting project in Sweden—lagen. nu. It is a unique practice, based on the same idea like Wikipedia: cost free, users make content, open source software and the most user friendly service available at the moment in legislation services. Some experience could be taken in to government projects, for example involving users to create better content and better legislation...|$|R

5000|$|As EEA {{membership}} is currently only open to <b>EFTA</b> or EU <b>members,</b> {{the consent of}} existing <b>EFTA</b> <b>member</b> states {{is required for the}} microstates to join the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr Støre, the then Foreign Minister of Norway which is an <b>EFTA</b> <b>member</b> state, said that EFTA/EEA membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their integration into the internal market because their requirements differed from those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified association would be better suited for them. [...] Espen Barth Eide, Støre's successor, responded to the Commission's report in late 2012 by questioning whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway was open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decide to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision on the matter. [...] Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another <b>EFTA</b> <b>member</b> state, was willing to discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not impede the functioning of the organisation. However, he suggested that the option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside both the EFTA and the EU, should be given consideration.|$|R

It allows the EFTA-EEA states to participate in the EU's Internal Market without being members of the EU. They adopt almost all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture and fisheries. However, they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process.
