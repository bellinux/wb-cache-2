5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> deep breath, {{and slowly}} pressed on the trigger. The buck stood {{still as a}} stone.|$|E
5000|$|I do them as {{directly}} as possible. If I {{am working}} from a cartoon, photograph or whatever, <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> small picture—the size that will fit into my opaque projector ... <b>I</b> don't <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> picture {{in order to}} reproduce it—I do {{it in order to}} recompose it ...

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> little {{breath of}} relief. I was {{reckless}} whether {{she heard it}} or not. Suddenly she paused.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> skin {{bag from}} the pocket of my coat, and poured some out upon the table, which he {{examined}} carefully.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> little {{nearer to}} her. It {{seemed to me}} that she was very pale, and there was trouble in her face.|$|E

60|$|I {{passed out}} of the restaurant, and ascended to my own room. There <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> sheet of paper toward me and wrote.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} promptly. There {{was a little}} murmur of voices. My guests {{gathered}} round me. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> long breath and continued on my mendacious career.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{so-called}} “trumping preemption” {{is in fact}} overdetermination or early preemption, and is thus not a distinctive form of redundant causation. <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> novel lesson from cases thought to be trumping: that the boundary between preemption and overdetermination should be reconsidered...|$|R
60|$|From {{this short}} Hint, thus repeated, <b>I</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> new Thesis, namely, That Devil is most {{dangerous}} {{that has no}} Cloven-Foot; or, if you will have it in Words more to the common Understanding, the Devil seems to be most dangerous when he goes without his Cloven-Foot.|$|R
60|$|His {{subordinates}} {{took the}} hint, and bolted down the hollow {{as hard as}} they could ride, while <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> deep breath and turned towards the rescue party.|$|E
60|$|His kisses {{fell upon}} my lips, {{and my head}} fell upon his shoulder. Then <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> sigh of deep content, and I felt that I had done well.|$|E

60|$|I paid my {{bill and}} departed. The commissionnaire {{pushed open the}} door, whistle in hand. He looked at me a little curiously. Without doubt he had watched my attempt to speak to Delora. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> half-sovereign from my pocket.|$|E
60|$|I {{stuck out}} my head, and escaped by a hair's-breadth. This time <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> dozen shots or more, {{and heard the}} Selenites {{shouting}} and twittering as if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar again.|$|E
60|$|The pearls for {{the ring}} were soon {{selected}} by Rupert, and approved of by Grace, after which I assumed {{the office of}} dividing the remainder myself. <b>I</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> chair, took the box from Rupert, and set about the task.|$|E
