40|$|Mandala is {{a system}} for using images to represent, access, and {{organize}} web information. Images from a web page represent {{the content of the}} page. Double-clicking on an image signals a web browser to display the associated page. People identify groups of images visually and share them with Mandala by dragging them between windows. Groups of image representations are stored as <b>imagemaps,</b> making it easy to save visual bookmarks, site indexes, and session histories. Image representations afford organizations that scale better than textual displays while revealing a wealth of additional information. People can easily group related images, identify relevant images, and use images as mnemonics. Hypermedia systems that use image representations seem less susceptible to classic hypertext problems. When image representations are derived from a proxy server cache, the resulting visualizations increase cache hitrates, access to relevant resources, and resource sharing, while revealing the dynam [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{geographic}} information system (GIS) is a powerful decision-support platform for environmental modeling and policy formulation. Before any analysis can be made, however, cartographic features need to be extracted from images and maintained in a database. The process of populating the database {{is estimated to be}} 60 - 80 % of the cost of implementing a GIS. This bottleneck will only increase with the unprecedented flow of images provided by such programs as NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. This paper presents research issues of creating an adaptive <b>imagemapping</b> tool that uses machine learning to automate the process of cartographic feature extraction. This tool works by watching the user select a sample subset of desired features, then uses these features to train a learning algorithm. Such a tool would allow a novice user to quickly create an automated feature-extraction program model that is, due to the embedded learning, easily adaptable to changing parameters such as resolution, lightin [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background HealthCyberMap [URL] aims at mapping {{parts of}} health {{information}} cyberspace in novel ways {{to deliver a}} semantically superior user experience. This is achieved through "intelligent" categorisation and interactive hypermedia visualisation of health resources using metadata, clinical codes and GIS. HealthCyberMap is an ArcView 3. 1 project. WebView, the Internet extension to ArcView, publishes HealthCyberMap ArcView Views as Web client-side <b>imagemaps.</b> The basic WebView set-up does not support any GIS database connection, and published Web maps become disconnected from the original project. A dedicated Internet map server {{would be the best}} way to serve HealthCyberMap database-driven interactive Web maps, but is an expensive and complex solution to acquire, run and maintain. This paper describes HealthCyberMap simple, low-cost method for "patching" WebView to serve hypermaps with dynamic database drill-down functionality on the Web. Results The proposed solution is currently used for publishing HealthCyberMap GIS-generated navigational information maps on the Web while maintaining their links with the underlying resource metadata base. Conclusion The authors believe their map serving approach as adopted in HealthCyberMap has been very successful, especially in cases when only map attribute data change without a corresponding effect on map appearance. It should be also possible to use the same solution to publish other interactive GIS-driven maps on the Web, e. g., maps of real world health problems. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} format of the "SPOT scene" digital products which are produced and distributed by SPOT IMAGE. This format is also called the "CAP format", since it has been designed to be produced by the Centre d’Archivage et de Prétraitement (CAP) located at SPOT IMAGE premices, in Toulouse. This format concerns the SPOT scenes which are processed at level 1 A, 1 B or 2 A. For other digital products (level 2 B, Ortho-images, <b>Imagemaps</b> like SPOTViewÒ), the format is the GIS-Geospot format (or “DIMAP”format) which is outside the scope of this document. This format is capable of handling the additionnal Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) band of SPOT 4. In the following, all specific to SPOT 4 will be with this font, in italic (titles or comments in “Times” italic are not to be considered as “SPOT 4 specific”) It has to be noticed that the previous format, defined in the document SI/AT/ 85. 0113 {{as well as in the}} Volume 2, chapter 2 of the SPOT Users Handbook will still be delivered for the following reasons : 1) there is an existing stock of old SPOT scenes, already processed at level 1 B, which are available only with the old format, 2) and it is impossible to convert the old one into the new one and vice-versa, because of the different characteristics of the Level 1 B geometric modelisation...|$|R

[...] is formed of slightly older formations of gabbro and pegmatite, intruded by dikes of basalt and diabase. Most of the dikes are oriented north-northeast (NNE), suggesting they formed {{at a time of}} east-southeast-west-northwest (ESE-WNW) extension. This is parallel to the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL), a major regional feature that passes just north of Bremerton which some believe shows strike-slip (horizontal) motion, but a connection with the OWL is yet to be shown. Sharp downwarping of these formations has created numerous faults, including the dip-slip (vertical movement) Gold Creek fault that separates the two mountains. Strands of the Seattle fault, which east of here trend nearly due west-east, appear to turn to the southwest in the vicinity of Green Mountain.|$|E

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{aimed to}} find {{an answer to the}} following question: 'How to design a grid shell for the canopy of a stadium that uses performance based densification to enhance the performance of the structure?'. De Nieuwe Kuip in Rotterdam is used as a case study to put the findings into practice. In order to answer this question a literature study into the application of wood, steel and FRP has been performed. In addition to that, a literature research into types of graded structures has been performed. This research showed that Voronoi and Delaunay are the most promising for the generation of a graded grid structure. Voronoi was chosen as it most resembles the desired look of a bone structure. The densification of the graded structure is based on an <b>imagemap</b> that has been created by analysing several performances. This performance map is a greyscale image that follows the form of the overall shape of the canopy in which lighter colours represent large openings and darker colours represent smaller openings. Three methods to generate a graded Voronoi based on this <b>imagemap</b> were tested. The first method is based on Lloyd’s algorithm, the second method is based on Force Driven Circle Packing and the last method is a Smart Circle Packing based on mesh relaxation techniques and mathematical theorems. The last method proved to be most suitable for the task. Lastly, the created abstract grid of lines was translated to a real structure. It has been structurally optimized and analysed and technical details were created. Architecture, Urbanism and Building Science...|$|E

Based on using readily-authored UML diagrams as multi-ended links, we hypertexturally connect two distinct areas of documentation: design documents and javadoc program code doc-umentation. Connecting the distinct areas is essential {{because it could}} help new developers in getting productive and supports de-velopment processes where both design and implementation change continuously. We also describe the lightweight implementation {{as a supplement to}} a Free Software toolchain. To achieve bi-directional linking, the implementation after-treats HTML pages generated by other tools, injecting into referred pages links back to the referring <b>imagemap</b> of each UML diagram. Each diagram also servers as a spatial con-text for navigation within target nodes. The software is currently a part of and in use at our software project. We mention how the scopes of the navigation system and software could be widened to hypertext document types outside the needs of our software project...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is the {{formation}} of new capillaries sprouting from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis occurs {{in a variety of}} normal physiological and pathological conditions and is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory angiogenic factors. The control of this balance may fail and result in {{the formation}} of a pathologic capillary network during the development of many diseases. Therefore, we developed the angiogenesis database (AngioDB), which can provide a signaling network of angiogenesis-related biomolecules in human. Each record of AngioDB consisted of 12 fields and was developed by using a relational database management system. For the retrieval of data, Active Server Page (ASP) technology was integrated in this system. Users can access the database by a query or <b>imagemap</b> browsing program. The retrieving system also provides a list of angiogenesis-related molecules classified by three categories, and the database has an external link to NCBI databases. AngioDB is available via the Internet at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A WebToon is a cartoon-style {{table of}} {{contents}} for HTML documents on the web, using imagemaps that are pictures of people talking. The people have word balloons above their heads; the word balloons serve as links to relevant pages. A WebToon adds the human touch to web interfaces, and makes web pages more approachable, interesting, and easier to navigate. Basically, to make a WebToon, you create a one-page collection of imagemaps featuring people talking. The talk is in word balloons that link to a relevant part of a document. The imagemaps are combined in a table that fits on one page. First organize your long document into chapters. Sketch a storyboard with one panel (image) for each chapter. Take photos of people acting out your storyboard. Use image-processing software such as Adobe Photoshop to crop and enhance your photos. Use a new image layer to add words that briefly describe each chapter. Use another layer to put white balloons behind the words. Make each image into a client-side <b>imagemap.</b> Organize the imagemaps with an HTML table. This report explains {{the details of how}} to make a WebToon...|$|E
