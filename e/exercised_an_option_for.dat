40|$|Background. Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is a serious}} disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Scientific findings showed that physical <b>exercise</b> is <b>an</b> <b>option</b> <b>for</b> treatment of these patients. This study’s objective is to investigate the effects of supervised aerobic and/or resistance physical training on inflammatory markers in subjects with T 2 DM. Methods. A systematic review was conducted on four databases, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and Scopus, and manual search from 21 to 30 November 2016. Randomized clinical trials involving individuals diagnosed with T 2 DM, who have undergone supervised training protocols, were selected in this study. Results. Eleven studies were included. Studies that evaluated control group versus aerobic exercise reported controversial results {{about the effectiveness of}} physical training in modifying C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokine levels. The only variable analyzed by the six studies in comparison to the control group versus resistance exercise was CRP. This protein showed no significant difference between groups. Between the two modes of exercise (aerobic and resistance), only one study demonstrated that aerobic exercise was more effective in reducing CRP. Conclusion. The evidence was insufficient to prove that aerobic or resistance exercise improves systemic levels of inflammatory markers in patients with T 2 DM...|$|R

Search Methods Fourteen databases were searched up to November 2010 with the terms tai chi, taichi, tai ji, taiji, taijichuan, cardiac, heart, coronary, myocardial, and atrial fibrillation in the title, abstract, or key words. No language restrictions were imposed. The quality and validity of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were evaluated using the Jadad Scale. The strength of the evidence for all included studies was evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Results Nine studies including 5 RCTs and 4 nonrandomized controlled clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Three studies examined the effectiveness of TC exercise for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), and 6 studies examined the effectiveness of TC exercise among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Overall, these studies demonstrated favorable effects of TC exercise for the patients with heart disease.

40|$|Mortgage option theoretic {{research}} generally {{focuses on}} the valuation of the default and prepayment options. Exercise of the delinquency option is often regarded as an interim step before terminal states of mortgage default or cure and of limited option value in its own right. However, in the current US housing crisis, borrowers may choose to defer a mortgage payment in order to mitigate a cash flow problem or improve their equity position. This option is available when the lender does not automatically foreclose on the delinquent borrower. Invariably, a negotiation commences between lender and borrower, each motivated by different sets of objectives. We model those negotiations by considering future unavoidable foreclosure costs. We derive closed form solutions for the optimal ex ante mortgage loan terms, such as LTV and coupon payment, offered by a lender to a borrower with <b>a</b> strategic delinquency <b>option.</b> We then compare the optimal ex post exercise, {{in terms of the}} borrower’s book LTV, of the delinquency option to the <b>exercise</b> of <b>a</b> default <b>option</b> <b>for</b> borrowers with heterogeneous expectations.

40|$|Allyn M Susko, G Kelley Fitzgerald Department of Physical Therapy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this review article is to explore the role of {{therapeutic}} exercise in managing the pain associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Therapeutic exercise is often recommended as a first-line conservative treatment for knee OA, and current evidence supports <b>exercise</b> as <b>an</b> effective pain-relieving intervention. We explore {{the current state of}} evidence for <b>exercise</b> as <b>a</b> pain-relieving intervention for knee OA. Next, the mechanisms by which knee OA pain occurs and the potential ways in which exercise may act on those mechanisms are discussed. Clinical applicability and future research directions are suggested. Although evidence demonstrates that exercise reduces knee OA pain, optimal exercise mode and dosage have not been determined. In addition, it is not clearly understood whether exercise provides pain relief via peripheral or central mechanisms or a combination of both. Published clinical trials have explored a variety of interventions, but these interventions have not been specifically designed to target pain pathways. Current evidence strongly supports <b>exercise</b> as <b>a</b> pain-relieving <b>option</b> <b>for</b> those with knee OA. Future research needs to illuminate the mechanisms by which exercise reduces the pain associated with knee OA and the development of therapeutic exercise interventions to specifically target these mechanisms.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the radial bone strength, sitting balance ability and global {{self-esteem}} of wheelchair martial arts practitioners and healthy control participants. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Nine wheelchair martial art practitioners with physical disabilities and 28 able-bodied healthy individuals participated in the study. The bone strength of the distal radius was assessed using the Sunlight Mini-Omni Ultrasound Bone Sonometer; sitting balance was quantified using the modified functional reach test (with reference to a scale marked on the wall); and the self-administered Rosenberg self-esteem (RSE) scale was used to measure the global self-esteem of the participants. The velocity of the ultrasound wave (speed of sound, m/s) traveling through the outer surface of the radial bone was measured and was then converted into a T-score and a Z-score. These ultrasound T-score and Z-score that represent bone strength; the maximum forward reaching distance in sitting (cm) that represents sitting balance; and the RSE total self-esteem score that indicates global self-esteem were used for analysis. Results: The results revealed that there were no statistically significant between-group differences for radial bone-strength, maximum forward reaching distance, or self-esteem outcomes. Conclusions: The wheelchair martial arts practitioners had similar radial bone strength, sitting balance performance and self-esteem to able-bodied healthy persons. Our results imply that wheelchair martial arts might improve bone strength, postural control and self-esteem in adult wheelchair users.

40|$|We {{find that}} {{employee}} stock option deductions lead to large aggregate tax savings for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and also affect corporate marginal tax rates. For Nasdaq firms, including the effect of options reduces the estimated median marginal tax rate from 31 % to 5 %. For S&P firms, in contrast, option deductions do not affect marginal tax rates to a large degree. Our evidence suggests that option deductions are important nondebt tax shields and that <b>option</b> deductions substitute <b>for</b> interest deductions in corporate capital structure decisions, explaining in part why some firms use so little debt. THIS PAPER EXPLORES the corporate tax implications of compensating employees with nonqualified stock options. Corporations deduct the difference between current market and strike prices when <b>an</b> employee <b>exercises</b> <b>a</b> nonqualified stock <b>option.</b> <b>For</b> option-intensive companies with rising stock prices, this deduction can be very large. We focus {{on the effects of}} options on the year 2000 marginal tax rates (MTRs) for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and the implications for debt policy. 1 Understanding the tax implications of options is increasingly important because the proportion of compensation paid in stock options has soared in recent years. A perspective on the magnitude of options compensation and its increase over time can be gained from papers like the one by Desai (2002), who reports that in 2000 the top five officers of the 150 largest U. S. firms received options with grant values exceeding $ 16 billion, which he estimates is a tenfold increase over the decade.

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness {{of aerobic exercise}} in the water with walking/jogging for women with fibromyalgia (FM). Methods. Sixty sedentary women with FM, ages 18 - 60 years, {{were randomly assigned to}} either deep water running (DWR) or land-based exercises (LBE). Patients were trained for 15 weeks at their anaerobic threshold. Visual analog scale of pain, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Beck Depression Inventory, Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF- 36), and a patient's global assessment of response to therapy (PGART) were measured at baseline, week 8, and week 15. Statistical analysis included all patients. Results. Four patients dropped out from each group. Both groups improved significantly at week 15 compared with baseline, with an average 36 % reduction in pain intensity. for PGART, 40 % of the DWR group and 30 % of the LBE group answered much better at posttreatment. FIQ total score and FIQ depression improvements in the DWR group were faster (week 8) than the LBE group and kept improving (week 15; P < 0. 05). Only the DWR group showed improvements in SF- 36 role emotional (P = 0. 006). No significant between-group differences were observed for peak oxygen uptake and other outcomes. Conclusion. DWR is <b>a</b> safe <b>exercise</b> that {{has been shown to be}} as effective as LBE regarding pain. However, it has been shown to bring more advantages related to emotional aspects. Aerobic gain was similar for both groups, regardless of symptom improvement. Therefore, DWR could be studied as <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>option</b> <b>for</b> patients with FM who have problems adapting to LBE or lower limbs limitations.

40|$|A low fat, high {{carbohydrate}} diet {{in combination}} with regular exercise is the traditional recommendation for treating diabetes. Compliance with these lifestyle modifications is less than satisfactory, however, and a high carbohydrate diet raises postprandial plasma glucose and insulin secretion, thereby increasing risk of CVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and diabetes. Moreover, the current epidemic of diabetes and obesity has been, {{over the past three}} decades, accompanied by a significant decrease in fat consumption and an increase in carbohydrate consumption. This apparent failure of the traditional diet, from a public health point of view, indicates that alternative dietary approaches are needed. Because carbohydrate is the major secretagogue of insulin, some form of carbohydrate restriction is a prima facie candidate for dietary control of diabetes. Evidence from various randomized controlled trials in recent years has convinced us that such diets are safe and effective, at least in short-term. These data show low carbohydrate diets to be comparable or better than traditional low fat high carbohydrate diets for weight reduction, improvement in the dyslipidemia of diabetes and metabolic syndrome as well as control of blood pressure, postprandial glycemia and insulin secretion. Furthermore, the ability of low carbohydrate diets to reduce triglycerides and to increase HDL is of particular importance. Resistance to such strategies has been due, in part, to equating it with the popular Atkins diet. However, there are many variations and room for individual physician planning. Some form of low carbohydrate diet, {{in combination with}} <b>exercise,</b> is <b>a</b> viable <b>option</b> <b>for</b> patients with diabetes. However, the extreme reduction of carbohydrate of popular diets (< 30 g/day) cannot be recommended for a diabetic population at this time without further study. On the other hand, the dire objections continually raised in the literature appear to have very little scientific basis. Whereas it is traditional to say that more work needs to be done, {{the same is true of}} the assumed standard low fat diets which have an ambiguous record at best. We see current trends in the national dietary recommendations as a positive sign and an appropriate move in the right direction...|$|R
