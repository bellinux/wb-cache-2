I am quiet. There is only one man who is vocal and he may be in trouble: [...] world chess {{champion}} [...] Kasparov.

2500|$|Sociobiology was {{initially}} met with substantial criticism. Several of Wilson's colleagues at Harvard, such as Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, were strongly opposed to his ideas regarding sociobiology. Gould, Lewontin, {{and others from}} the Sociobiology Study Group from the Boston area wrote [...] "Against 'Sociobiology'" [...] in an open letter criticizing Wilson's [...] "deterministic view of human society and human action". Although attributed {{to members of the}} Sociobiology Study Group, it seems that Lewontin was the main author. In a 2011 interview, Wilson said, [...] "I believe Gould was a charlatan. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ... seeking reputation and credibility as a scientist and writer, and he did it consistently by distorting what other scientists were saying and devising arguments based upon that distortion." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2017 BFI London Film Festival, Guadagnino {{stated that}} he was open {{to the idea of}} a sequel in 2020, {{suggesting}} it might be in the style of Richard Linklater's Before trilogy, whilst telling the story of Oliver and Elio as they aged. [...] "If I paired the age of Elio in the film with the age of Timothée, in three years’ time, Timothée will be 25, as would Elio by the time the second story was set," [...] he said. In the novel, Elio and Oliver reunited 15 years later, when Oliver is married. Guadagnino said that Elio probably wouldn’t be gay in the potential sequel: [...] "I don’t think Elio is necessarily going to become a gay man. He hasn’t found his place yet. I can tell you that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would start an intense relationship with Marzia [...] again.” Guadagnino is also interested in the politics of the 1990s, saying [...] "it would be the beginning of the Berlusconi era in Italy and it would mean dealing with the war of Iraq.” ...|$|E

The second time--and not very long after--I saw him well dressed, lounging like any other young man on a Sunday afternoon, and <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took the liberty of bowing to me then because I had once looked at him under a misapprehension." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1816 or 1817, James Greenleaf made known {{to his wife}} his desire to return to Washington, D.C., to live full-time. Ann Greenleaf, however, was unwilling to do so. In an 1817 letter to her friend and trustee, William Tilghman, she wrote: [...] "It would be unkind of me to say to Mr. Greenleaf, that I never shall be {{reconciled}} to a residence in Washington, D.C., and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not suspect that such are my sentiments, but I say to you my dear Sir unhesitatingly, that I dislike Washington... I love retirement, particularly the retirement of Allentown." [...] Nonetheless, Ann accompanied her husband to the District of Columbia for short periods. They spent Christmas 1821 in the city, and {{during the winter of}} 1826 they rented a home (owned by William H. Crawford) on 14th Street NW just north of Thomas Circle. They also spent the summer of 1828 in the city, living at Washington House at 222 North Capitol Street. During the first two decades of the new century, Greenleaf continued to repair many of his personal relationships. By 1830, he had reconciled with most of his family. He spent Christmas 1830 at the Washington home of his brother-in-law, William Cranch. During this stay, he also reunited with Noah Webster {{for the first time in}} years.|$|E
2500|$|Levinas {{pointed to}} the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first {{commanded}} Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, {{he would not have}} listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, [...] "transcending ethics" [...] seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in Fear and Trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always {{in one way or another}} ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in Stages on Life's Way. I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, “These things I said not unto you from the beginning … I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now” – so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.

60|$|We {{could not}} quicken the {{movements}} of the sluggish craft fret as we might, and when, as balm to my impatience, I would have talked with Hiram concerning the possibilities of the future, he showed no further inclination to converse on the matter, thus proving, as <b>I</b> <b>believed,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was more anxious concerning the outcome of the venture than he would permit us to see, all of which was most gratifying because it accorded well with my desires.|$|R

I had heard often of John of Gamala, and deemed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a brave and skilful warrior; {{and it seemed}} {{impossible}} that young man could be he. As to what I {{am going to do}} with him, I have nothing to do but what he has himself demanded--namely, to be sent to Titus. He produced the signet ring of Caesar; said that it was given to him by the general, himself; and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> told him <b>that,</b> if <b>he</b> presented it to a Roman at any time, he would lead him to his presence. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had stolen the ring, or had got it from somebody that had stolen it; and he then told me of the story, very much as you have told it--save <b>that</b> <b>he</b> said <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> was well-nigh conquered by Titus, and sprang upon him, Caesar's foot slipped, and <b>he</b> fell--hinting <b>that</b> his success was the result of accident, rather than his own effort. He spoke by no means boastingly of it, but as if it was the most natural thing in the world." ...|$|R
