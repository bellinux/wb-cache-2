40|$|Many {{metabolomic}} applications use gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) under standard 70 eV {{electron ionization}} (El) parameters. However, {{the abundance of}} molecular ions is often extremely low, impeding the calculation of elemental compositions for the identification of unknown compounds. On changing the beam-steering voltage of the ion source, the relative abundances of molecular ions at 70 eV El were increased up to ten-fold for alkanes, fatty acid methyl esters and trimethylsilylated metabolites, concomitant with 2 -fold absolute increases in ion intensities. We have compared the abundance, mass accuracy and isotope ratio accuracy of molecular species in El with those in chemical <b>ionization</b> (CI) <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> as reagent gas under high-mass tuning. Thirty-three peaks of a diverse set of trimethylsilylated metabolites were analyzed in triplicate, resulting in 342 ion species ([M+H](+), [M-CH(3) ](+) for CI and [M](+), [M-CH(3) ](+center dot) for EI). On average, CI yielded 8 -fold more intense molecular species than El. Using internal recalibration, average mass errors of 1. 8 +/- 1. 6 mm/z units and isotope ratio errors of 2. 3 +/- 2. 0 % (A+ 1 /A ratio) and 1. 7 +/- 1. 8 % (A+ 2 /A ratio) were obtained.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown {{in our previous}} investigations {{that the presence of}} oxygen is required for the benzene methylation <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> over zeolite catalysts in a high pressure batch reactor. Thus, a two-step mechanism involving the formation of methanol intermediate by methane partial oxidation followed by benzene methylation with methanol in the second step was postulated. This paper now presents the results of further investigation that provide more evidence that the catalytic benzene methylation <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> does occur and that the reaction is limited by the amount of oxygen. Further support is therefore given to the two-step oxidative reaction mechanism. Suggestions for further work in this area are also given...|$|R

In wetlands with lower water tables, the movement of oxygen in and out of the soil can increase the oxidation of methane and the inhibition of methanogenesis, nulling the relationship between methane emission and NEP because methane production becomes dependent upon factors deep within the soil.|$|R

40|$|Selective {{catalytic}} reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) in flue gas or engine exhaust gas with hydrocarbons as the reductant has {{great potential for}} less expense, less pollution, and easier operation than SCR <b>with</b> ammonia. <b>Methane</b> is the preferred reducing gas because of its low cost and low toxicity. Stable, low-cost catalysts for SCR <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> are required to demonstrate this technology for controlling NO{sub x} emissions. Several cobalt and nickel catalysts on synthetic clay and uranium oxide supports were investigated for their activities in reducing NO{sub x} <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> {{in the presence of}} air. The efficiency of the synthetic clay-supported nickel and cobalt catalysts for nitric oxide (NO) reduction <b>with</b> <b>methane</b> as the reducing gas was poor. The nickel oxide-uranium oxide catalyst, which was chosen for its high stability, was also ineffective. Results from the two-step experiments conducted at two temperatures produced some interesting information on the reactions of <b>methane</b> <b>with</b> the catalysts and the reactivity of the carbonaceous intermediate. The carbonaceous material formed from methane dissociation at 450 {degrees}C not only reduces NO to N{sub 2 }O at lower temperatures, but also prevents oxidation of NO to NO{sub 2 }. Unfortunately, the carbonaceous forms that reduce the NO are not available for reactions at 400 {degrees}C in the presence of oxygen. A two-step process employing this chemistry would be difficult because the catalyst would have to be cycled between the two temperatures. Also the desired reduction to nitrogen is not very efficient...|$|R
