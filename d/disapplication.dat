According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood {{in the way of the}} granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the <b>disapplication</b> of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have [...] "conferred upon them rights directly contrary to Parliament's sovereign will". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.|$|E

In order to enhance the understanding and location of the court system in our country, was first traced the historical evolution {{of the system of}} administrative justice in Italy through a comparison with the experience of other European states and a description of the many important steps that led to the recognition of separation between the courts and the administrative judge.

Starting from the court which was set up under Law No 2248 of 1865, and in particular the estimates contained in Articles 4 and 5 of Annex E of the same, the study focused in particular on the <b>disapplication</b> by the courts.

40|$|In several European countries, prisons {{have been}} created solely to house foreign {{national}} prisoners without leave to remain. Contrary to contemporary international human rights law and standards on prison management, {{there seems to be}} a trend towards the <b>disapplication</b> of rehabilitative theory and practice for this group of prisoners. In particular, they do not seem to receive the same preparation for release and reintegrative support as other prisoners. This paper explores the role international standards and oversight bodies have in upholding rehabilitation as the foundational objective for prison management in foreign national only prisons. It outlines the changes to the prison estate, policy and regime that have resulted from the increasing focus on removal within both the prison and penal process. The consequences of the <b>disapplication</b> of rehabilitation for prisons, prison officers, prisoners and society itself are analysed before the paper moves to examine the role oversight bodies could and should play in the protection of the rights of this vulnerable category of prisoner and the primacy that should be accorded to rehabilitative theory and practice. It concludes by asking whether such standards and oversight have inverted the panopticon by placing the trigger for international reactions in the hands of prisoners and NGOs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{understanding}} of Article 106 (2) TFEU using composite legal and economic interrogative frameworks. Article 106 (2) provides that under specified conditions, any Treaty rule may be disapplied with respect to services of general economic interest (‘SGEIs’). The underlying research tests two principal claims concerning Article 106 (2). The first is that it is the central Treaty provision for reconciling EU and Member State interests concerning SGEIs, and the second, {{is that it is a}} strict exception. The purely legal component of the analysis comprises internal and external accounts of Article 106 (2). The former concerns its operation on a standalone basis, with the latter dissecting its interaction with other TFEU derogation mechanisms. The internal analysis reveals the seeming volatility of the manifest error standard and considers the effects of enduring difficulties concerning proportionality review. The external account discloses the ubiquitous contingency of Article 106 (2), resulting in it being side-lined in a variety of ways. In overall terms, Article 106 (2) is shown not to be the central Treaty mediating mechanism for SGEIs that it may be capable of being. The combined legal and economic component of the thesis is based on deploying the theory of market failure and its analogue, government failure, in order to test whether Article 106 (2) is a strict exception. Market failure is used to assess SGEI verification. Government failure is used to assess the <b>disapplication</b> of other Treaty provisions under Article 106 (2). The market failure analysis reveals that manifest error control is strict for efficiency related market failures, for EU circumscribed distributional objectives, and occasionally, elsewhere. The government failure analysis discloses significant but avoidable weaknesses in <b>disapplication</b> review, but with pronounced change over time, including a relative recent partial revival of its strictness following Altmark. In the aggregate, the combination of legal and economic analysis shows Article 106 (2) not to be a strict exception, except in limited circumstances. In the light of the findings on centrality and strictness, proposals for the reorientation of Article 106 (2) are made...|$|E
40|$|It {{is legally}} more complex to {{regulate}} the non-economic aspects of the Single Market, such as {{a high level of}} consumer protection, than to ensure market access by operators. The latter can frequently be ensured by the <b>disapplication</b> of national rules obstructing one of the free movements provisions, whereas the former may require the courts to practically redraft a rule of national law. Ensuring compliance with Community standards will depend to a large extent on the willingness of the national courts to creatively construe their domestic law in order to give effect to Community law. Private law sanctions, in particular injunctions, are useful as a policing mechanism in this context. In cross-border situations in particular, civil remedies are potentially effective instruments of enforcement, both for the benefit of private actors and public bodies. The main part of this paper will be a detailed discussion of four illustrative cases, including the Konsumentenombudsman case of July 1997. Before doing so, the legal framework is sketched; afterwards, the most relevant legislative development will be examined...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} analysis of the UK coalition Government’s educational computing policies. It argues that such policies must be viewed {{in relation to the}} broader ideological intent underpinning their development and the neo liberal orientation that seeks to further privatise and marketise education. In examining the related justificatory discourse, it is argued that the ideological origins of policy direction are masked through the selective use of selective and questionable ‘evidence’ to support policies facilitating the further encroachment of vested industry interests. Furthermore, the symbolic re-presentation and repositioning of technology in schools through the <b>disapplication</b> of ICT Programmes of Study and a new emphasis on the teaching of computer science, not only diverts the purpose of education and educational technology further toward the needs of industry but may also lead to computer science being constructed as an elitist and selective subject. This is likely to have profound implications in terms of equality, with schools, individuals and groups who have less economic, social and cultural capitals being most at risk of a new form of digital exclusion...|$|E

It has no direct {{regulatory}} powers, but is entrusted with developing norms of food safety, which are to inform the material content of EC food law. The hope is that its independence and expertise will restore popular confidence both in the EU and in the food we eat. The irreducible nature of lay-expert conflicts about hazard suggests that a more likely scenario is that such disputes become recast as opposition to EC law. Such conflict {{is most likely to}} manifest itself in national courts through challenges to or non-compliance with EC law. The current principles for resolution of such conflicts are hopelessly outmoded. The article, therefore, argues for a constitutional resettlement, which sets out principles germane {{to the nature of the}} EC regime, namely that of a multi-level regulatory State. It argues for a new defence of regulatory balance. Individuals could argue for the <b>disapplication</b> of EC norms where these violated a valued local regime which had given consideration to the issues raised in the EC legislation and whose positive value to its subjects exceeded its negative impact on the interests protected by the EC legislation...|$|E
40|$|The Taricco case {{is about}} VAT fraud. Since VAT revenue forms {{part of the}} EU’s own resources, VAT fraud {{is a matter of}} Union law. 1 As a consequence, the duty to provide {{effective}} sanctions for violations of EU law applies to cases of VAT fraud. Because the duty under EU law to provide effective sanctions is usually based on Article 4 (3) TEU, the primacy of Union law clearly precludes the application of national rules that would render sanctions ineffective. Matters are more complicated, however, when the <b>disapplication</b> of the national rules would violate a fundamental right that is protected by national constitutional law. 2 In that case, underlining the precedence of the duty to provide effective sanctions exposes the inherent tension between effective sanctions and fundamental rights. 3 It moreover reveals that a tension exists between EU law’s principles of effectiveness and primacy on the one hand, and fundamental rights as protected by national constitutions on the other. 4 This tension is clearly visible when EU law requires the imposition of criminal penalties, because these sanctions, by definition, have a serious impact {{from the perspective of the}} individual. In the field of criminal law it is therefore widely acknowledged that fundamental rights provide legitimate grounds for limiting the effectiveness of sanctions...|$|E
40|$|After {{the entry}} into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights (‘the Charter’) has found a place among the formal sources of EU law, {{and has become a}} {{standard}} of review for the validity of EU acts. It became legally binding for EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, but also to the Member States. Even after the {{entry into force}} of the Charter’, some doubts regarding its legal effects are still looming large. Among them is whether, and to what extent, the Charter applies to national measures that are connected to EU law but are not intended to implement it directly. This legal uncertainty affects the position of individuals seeking to assert their fundamental rights before a national judge. In particular, whereas the application of the Charter warrants <b>disapplication</b> of the conflicting national measures, the same remedy is often not available when plaintiffs rely only on other fundamental rights instruments (like the European Convention on Human Rights or national constitutions). There {{is no doubt that the}} borderline between EU law and national law is not always easy to establish in a concrete case. This article discusses theoretical and practical problems arising out of the application and interpretation of Article 51 (1) of the Charter, according to which the Charter is addressed to the Member States ‘only when they are implementing Union law’...|$|E
40|$|Aquesta ponència forma part del Workshop internacional de doctorands organitzat pel Programa de Doctorat en Dret de la UAB i la Facultat de Dret de la UAB, amb el suport de l’École Européenne de Droit de l’Université Toulouse CapitoleIn the Taricco judgment, the ECJ {{held that}} Article 325 TFEU {{requires}} the national courts {{to disregard the}} Italian rules of limitation periods if their application prevents the imposition of effective and deterrent penalties in {{a significant number of}} cases of serious fraud affecting EU financial interests. In Italy, some courts considered that the <b>disapplication</b> imposed by the ECJ runs counter to the fundamental principles of the Italian constitutional system, including the principle of strict legality in criminal matters, formally recognized in the Italian Constitution. Consequently, the ICC had been requested by these judges to exercise the “counter-limits” power in order to prevent the enforcement of the ECJ ruling in Taricco. The ICC sought a preliminary reference from the ECJ on the interpretation of the Article 325 TFUE, making some important statements on the principle of legality. In particular, the ICC stated that this principle is an expression of a supreme principle of the legal order, which has been posited in order to safeguard the inviolable rights of the individual, by clarifying also that this principle does not grant the courts the power to create new criminal law in place of that established by legislation approved by Parliament. Awaiting the ECJ’s decision on the case, there are already several points {{on the issue of the}} “Judiciary creation of law and dialogue between judges” around which is possible to discuss and confront different legal traditions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the findings of}} the research financed under the Research Project of Relevant National Interest (PRIN) prot. n. 200832 PPPJ, on the issue of “European integration through Procedural Law", which the author coordinated from 2012 as National and Local Unit Supervisor. In this perspective, the paper firstly underlines that the role of the Italian Constitutional Court has been increasingly restrained not only by EU rules having direct effects, but also by general principles to which the Court of Justice grants the same effects, as long as they justify «in any case» the <b>disapplication</b> of inconsistent national rules. Starting from this finding, the paper points out that the Constitutional Court gives nonetheless broad consideration to EU law issues and shows, in so doing, a remarkable opening towards «external» sources of law, as the constitutional judgment No. 80 / 2011 clearly confirms. In this view, the Court has recently suggested that the provisions of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights could work as «special» parameters (“norme interposte”) for the purpose of constitutional review of legislation, in order to ensure an adequate level of protection to the rights thereby established. In the same view, the Court has also significantly rethought its relation with the European Court of Justice and it has referred to the ECJ both questions of interpretation and of validity of EU law, although so far only in the course of «principal» proceedings (i. e. proceedings started by the State or other «privileged» applicants) and not yet in the course of «incidental» proceedings (i. e. proceedings concerning questions raised by national courts), despite the unanimous opinion of legal scholarship. The Constitutional Court has finally asserted its capability to play a role within the European integration process by reserving its power (through the application of the so-called counter-limits theory) to review the Italian legislation implementing the European Treaties in the unlikely hypotheses of their contrast with the fundamental principles of the national constitutional order or with the fundamental rights of the individuals...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} do Italian courts adapt the {{national}} legal instruments (principles, rules and legal techniques) regarding state structure {{to the requirements of}} EU law? This paper aims to give an answer to this question by providing an overview of the most emblematic cases of “re-adaptations” operated by the Italian courts in order to ensure the respect of the structural principles of EU law. In doing so, I will distinguish two kinds of principles/rules (i. e. normative enunciations) and instruments/techniques (here understood as operative emanations of the normative enunciations) originally conceived for other goals and in a second moment used by the Italian Courts in order to comply with the EU law requirements. The first group is composed of those principles/rules and techniques expressly conceived for governing the relationship between Regions and State, provided with a more substantive (i. e. non-procedural) nature and reshaped over the years by the Italian Constitutional Court. The second group is composed of principles/rules and techniques characterizing the proceedings before the Italian Constitutional Court (which also serves as final arbiter in the conflicts between Regions and State) that are provided with a genuine procedural nature and that have been used, over the years, by the Italian Constitutional Court in order to guarantee first of all the supremacy of the constitution and, episodically, the primacy of EU law. These principles and techniques do not concern exclusively the relationship between State and Regions but they can, of course, be used in order to guarantee the respect of EU law even in cases involving regional legislation. Keeping this mind I have structured this contribution as follows: First, I will explain the reasons why research like this is “difficult”, while secondly I will move to the analysis of the two groups of legal instruments mentioned above. Some final remarks will be presented {{at the end of the}} paper. I. Overview of the research. II. The substantive principles concerning the relationship between State and Regions: 1.

The progressive abandonment of the impermeability doctrine: the extension of the “interposition technique”. V. Final remark...|$|E
40|$|Capital {{maintenance}} rules {{are part of}} a legal capital regime that consists of rules on raising capital and rules on maintaining it. The function of these rules is the protection of the corporation’s creditors. This is evidenced by the fact that in public as well as private companies the provisions on legal capital are not open to <b>disapplication</b> or variation even with unanimous shareholder consent. Thus, providing the company with a minimum of funding and ensuring equal treatment of shareholders are mere reflexes of creditor protection or, at best, ancillary purposes of legal capital. Legal capital is part of a corporation’s equity. The key feature of equity is that it ranks behind the claims of other stakeholders in the distribution of a corporation’s assets. Consequently, equity will also be the first part of a corporation’s funds to be depleted by losses. Capital {{maintenance rules}} seek to enforce this order of priority of different groups of stakeholders by restricting distributions to shareholders. Such restrictions are not unique to legal systems that have adopted a legal capital regime. A prominent example of a statute that has eliminated mandatory legal capital is the Delaware General Corporation Law. § 154 DCGL leaves it up to the directors to decide whether any part of the consideration received by the corporation for its shares shall be attributed to capital. Thus, a Delaware corporation need not have any stated capital. This has significant impact on the funds available for distribution to shareholders. Pursuant to § 170 (a) DGCL dividends may only be paid out of surplus or, in the absence of surplus, out of net profits of the current or the preceding fiscal year. § 154 DGCL defines surplus as the excess of a corporation’s net assets over the amount of its capital, and net assets as the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities. A corporation without stated capital may, therefore, distribute all of its net assets to its shareholders and continue business without any equity on its balance sheet. This highlights the difference between the different approaches to creditor protection in Germany and the U. S. Both legal systems acknowledge the priority of creditors over shareholders in corporate distributions. However, German law seeks to give creditors additional comfort by requiring companies to raise and maintain additional layers of assets above and beyond those corresponding to the company’s liabilities that may not be depleted by way of distributions to shareholders. While private companies must merely raise and maintain their stated capital, public companies are required to raise and maintain additional equity accounts unavailable for distributions to shareholders such as the share premium account 1 and the legal reserve. 2 In recent years a number of objections have been raised against this concept of creditor protection. Critics argue that contractual arrangements are a more efficient means for protecting the interests of creditors. 3 Capital maintenance does not prevent creditors from negotiating for more stringent protection of their claims such as collateral or financial covenants. It does, however, provide a minimum standard of protection for the benefit of creditors who lack the commercial experience or the bargaining power or who, like tort victims, are simply unable to negotiate for contractual safeguards. Capital maintenance ensures that their protection against excessive distributions does not depend on large creditors who are free to waive covenants that, in effect, benefit all creditors in exchange for individual arrangements that work exclusively in their favour...|$|E
