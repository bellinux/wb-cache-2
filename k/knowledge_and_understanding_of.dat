Promotion tests vary from school to school, but may include such elements as the execution of patterns, which combine various techniques in specific sequences; the breaking of boards to demonstrate the ability to use techniques with both power and control; sparring and self-defense to demonstrate the practical application and control of techniques; physical fitness usually with push-ups and sit-ups; and answering questions on terminology, concepts, and history to demonstrate <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the art.

25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E

He begins in naivety, gradually discovering his profound errors in judgement. In this sense, the novel {{can be thought}} of as a Bildungsroman, or coming of age story. Since the novel is presented as Ai's journey of transformation, Ai's position as the narrator increases the credibility of the story. The narration is complemented by her writing style, described by a reviewer as [...] "precise, dialectical—always evocative in its restrained pathos" [...] which is [...] "exquisitely fitted to her powers of invention".|$|E
500|$|Like {{many of his}} Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard [...] "proceeds on the {{assumption}} that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa are a noble, civilising enterprise". Although Haggard penned a number of novels that portrayed Africans in a comparatively realistic light, She was not among their number. Even in King Solomon's Mines, the representation of Umbopa (who was based on an actual warrior) and the Kukuanas, drew upon Haggard's <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Zulus. In contrast, She makes no such distinctions. Ayesha, the English travellers, and the ancient inhabitants of Kôr are all white embodiments of civilisation, while the darker Amahagger, as a people, illustrate notions of savagery, barbarity, and superstition. Nonetheless, the [...] "racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear", given that Ayesha is in origin an ancient Arabian, Leo is descended from, and physically resembles a blond Hellenistic Greek, while Holly is said to resemble a baboon in facial appearance – an animal Victorians typically associated with black Africans. Whilst critics like Wendy Katz, Patricia Murphy, and Susan Gubar have analysed the strong racist undercurrent in She, Andrew Stauffer has taken note of the qualifications through which [...] "the novel suggests deeper connections among the races, an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid".|$|E
