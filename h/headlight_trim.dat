50|$|Introduced in 1978, the ER was {{produced}} through the 1980s with relatively few detail changes. In 1984, the headlights and front turn signals were switched from round to rectangular units. In 1991, the driver's compartment was redesigned, {{with a much}} larger windshield. During the late 1990s, this model was distinguished from MVP-series ERs by its optional black plastic <b>headlight</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Both the Levin and Trueno {{variants}} {{were offered}} {{with either a}} 2-door coupe or 3-door liftback (sometimes called hatchback) body style. The Levin and Trueno were generally identical, apart from fixed, rectangular headlights on the Levin and pop-up headlights on the Trueno. Minor bodywork changes were made in 1986 which resulted in different tail lights, front and rear bumpers, corner and <b>headlight</b> <b>trim</b> lights, and grilles, are the main differences for both Levin and Trueno models, along with the coupe and hatchback styles. The models sold between 1983-1985 are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zenki" [...] (前期, lit. early period), and the models sold from 1986-1987 are referred to as [...] "kouki" [...] (後期, lit. latter period).|$|E
5000|$|The Scout II is most {{identifiable}} by its different front grilles. The 1971-1972 Scout II {{shared the}} same grille, three horizontal bars between the headlights and chrome rings around the headlights. 1973 Scout II's had 14 vertical bars between the headlights, a split in the middle, seven bars on each side surrounded by chrome trim pieces and an [...] "International" [...] model plate low on the left side. 1974-75 Scout II grilles {{were the same as}} 1973, {{with the addition of a}} vertical bar trim overlay. The 1975 had chrome and black square trim rings around the headlights. 1976 had the same <b>headlight</b> <b>trim</b> rings as 1975, a chrome center grille of 15 horizontal bars split into three sections was used in this year only. 1977-79 Scout II's used the same grille between the same headlight bezels the new chrome grille had two large horizontal bars with three vertical support lines and the [...] "International" [...] nameplate moved up to the center of the grille on the left side. In 1980, the final year of production for the Scout, the grille was a very distinctive design, available with black or silver, a one piece grille with square headlights, made of ABS plastic. Both grille color options had imprinted chrome trim around the headlights and an [...] "International" [...] name located on the left side.Starting with late 1974 Scout IIs disc and power brakes were standard features. Early 1974 models had disc brakes as a rarely selected option. A three-speed automatic transmission was optional.|$|E
50|$|The Argenta {{was closely}} {{based on its}} {{predecessor}} Fiat 132. All body panels and windows except the doors were new. Other changes included new trim, wheels, dashboard, mirrors and rectangular <b>headlights.</b> <b>Trim</b> level was raised compared to the previous 132 and the contemporary 131 Mirafiori, with power steering, electric windows and door locking. Some markets had a large manually-sliding steel sunroof, others had air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as a}} full body, the {{standard}} Leader features included a <b>headlight</b> <b>trimmer,</b> an extendable lifting handle for easy centrestand use, and a permanent windscreen mounting. Factory listed options included: integrated-design hard-luggage 'panniers', the first flashing indicators on a British motorcycle, a dash-mounted parking light, windscreen top-extension (adjustable on the move), a rear rack and a clock aperture built into a 'dashboard' (closed-off by an Ariel badge when not fitted).|$|R
50|$|A {{downside}} was {{an increase}} in the car's insurance group from 9 to 12. The exterior look was amended as the 406 featured more pronounced ribs, clear <b>headlights,</b> chrome <b>trim</b> and a new honeycomb grill. The rear lights were finished in red with a strip of the car's paint colour across the centre.|$|R
5000|$|Explorers {{initially}} came in 4 trim levels: {{the base}} model XL (which was later {{replaced with the}} XLS trim package as the base trim), XLT, Sport (only available on 3-door model), and the upscale Eddie Bauer edition. For the 1993 model year, engine output was increased by [...] {{for a total of}} [...] The Limited edition, added for the 1993 model year, was available only in the 5-door body style and was positioned {{at the top of the}} lineup above the Eddie Bauer edition. It featured automatic headlights, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, foglamps, a center roof console with compass and outside thermometer, unique wheels and grille, and an automatic transmission as standard equipment. The grill and <b>headlight</b> <b>trims</b> on the Limited edition were paint-matched to the body color, unlike the chrome (XLT) or black plastic (XL) versions on other trim levels.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Avenger {{initially}} {{was similar to}} the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the 'Super' (two <b>headlights,</b> vinyl <b>trim,</b> 1.5 L single carburettor engine, manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd's added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor 'TC' model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back 'tombstone' front seats, special bright paint colours and new wheel trims, among other detail changes. This was loosely based on the UK GT but lacked that car's 'Rostyle' wheels, using locally-made, look-alike pressed aluminium wheel trims instead.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota's {{large family}} car lineup in Europe was quite {{confusing}} when {{looking over the}} past 25 years. The 1970 through 1983 Carina sister models had been sold in most of Europe, but in 1984 they were replaced with the [...] "Carina II" [...] - which was really the 1983 model Corona as sold in Japan with alterations to the <b>headlights,</b> grille and <b>trim</b> (the Carina in Japan {{at that time was}} a similar but boxier vehicle.) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{completely}} new generation body design emerged with the HQ series in July 1971, {{including the new}} Monaro 'LS' (commonly believed to mean [...] "Luxury Sports") model which featured four <b>headlights</b> and chrome <b>trim</b> rings taken from the Holden Premier sedan. There were no longer any six-cylinder versions of the Monaro GTS, just the locally manufactured 4.2 L (253 cu in) or optional 308 cuin L V8s or the top level GTS350 coupé, equipped with an imported 350 cuin L Chevrolet motor.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 the grille was {{redesigned}} with wider {{spaces between}} the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the <b>headlights.</b> The <b>trim</b> of the Series 75 long wheelbase model was distinctive from other lines. A horizontal rub molding ran from the front parking light housings to {{the trailing edge of}} the front door and stopped. A full length vertical air slot-style fenderbreak molding was placed directly behind the rear gap of the back doors. The two moldings did not meet at right angles. A Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid. The high headroom appearance was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine continued to feature auxiliary seats for extra passenger carrying capacity and the Imperial limousine had a hydraulically operated glass driver's partition. Engine output was increased to 250 hp (186 kW). An optional dual-four barrel carb setup boasted 270 hp (201 kW). Hydramatic automatic transmission was now standard equipment.|$|R

[...] Tailamps and rear reflector bar were slightly reshaped. [...] All models were renamed from Eighty Eight Royale to Eighty Eight and Eighty Eight LS ( [...] which migrated from an 88 Royale trim). [...] The LSS continued with the same changes to the exterior as other models, the addition of Aurora styled seats, but the same center console was retained for one more year.

5000|$|The Crown range now {{included}} the 4-door station wagon, pick-up (rare), double cab pick-up (very rare) {{and the new}} two-door hardtop [...] "personal luxury car". In 1969 the Crown received a facelift for the <b>headlight,</b> grill and <b>trim</b> arrangement. The Crown S used the two-litre 'six', but due to sportier tuning it produced more power than the larger 2M, [...] at 5,800 rpm versus [...] at 5,200 rpm. The commercial versions were fitted with the six-cylinder [...] "M" [...] engine (M-C) produce , while the four-cylinder 5R had {{to make do with}} [...] This generation was the only one to use a double-hinged tailgate, as the next generation converted to an overhead-lifting hatchback door.|$|R
5000|$|Catallo {{bought the}} vehicle in 1956 for $75 in Michigan {{when he was}} 15 years old. Catallo {{replaced}} the original stock Ford engine (unlike The Beach Boys song lyrics, which mention [...] "a flathead mill") with a newer Oldsmobile V-8, chopped and channelled to lower the top by 6 in. Much of the original customizing work, including the stacked <b>headlights,</b> side <b>trim,</b> and grille was done by an auto shop owned by Mike and Larry Alexander in the Detroit suburb of Southfield. After Catallo moved to Southern California, additional work, including the chopped top, was done in 1960-61 at 'Kustom City', George Barris's noted North Hollywood auto customizing shop. This led to the magazine cover and two years later, the shot was featured as the cover for The Beach Boys' fourth album. Catallo sold the coupe {{a few years later}} but, urged by his son Curt, was able to buy it back in the late 1990s for $40,000. The car had since been additionally modified but was restored by Catallo with many of the original part, so it is again virtually identical to the famous photo. In 2000, the hot rod won the 'People's Choice' award at the Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance.|$|R
5000|$|November 1978 brought {{minor changes}} to the Laurel, {{including}} squaring off of the front <b>headlights.</b> The highest <b>trim</b> level, [...] "Medalist", received air conditioning in addition to its OHC four-cylinder two-litre diesel engine. The 1800 cc cars switched to the newer Z18 crossflow engine and all Laurels now met the Showa 53 (1979) gasoline vehicle emission regulations. Later, in October 1979, a two-litre four-cylinder gasoline option (Z20-series) was added in several markets. Also new were the options of automatic transmission and the SGL equipment grade on diesel vehicles. In February 1980 an electric sunroof and the a hardtop version of the Medalist was added. This was the first year in which a sunroof was a model option. In July 1980 Limited a special edition [...] "gold medalist" [...] top-of-the-line trim was released.|$|R
50|$|Duke and Duchess of Croydon: In another {{instance}} the Duke and Duchess of Croydon are {{hiding out in}} the hotel as {{they are responsible for}} a gruesome hit-and-run accident which made the headlines. The Duke had gone to a night club and the Duchess reaches the club to find her husband. On their way back the Duke hits a woman and her daughter and both the woman and her daughter died. However, in the accident the <b>headlight</b> and the <b>trim</b> ring of the car were damaged. The Duke and Duchess arrived back at the hotel and {{try to find a way}} out, so that there not the slightest suggestion of them being involved in an accident. When the room-service waiter arrives in the presidential suite with dinner, the Duchess intentionally hits him so that her dress gets spoiled. The Duchess creates a big issue over this, just to make her presence felt so that it can be interpreted that she was in the hotel. But the chief house officer Ogilvie gets a hint of it and tries to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. They finally reach an agreement that Ogilvie would drive their Jaguar to Chicago and a total of twenty-five thousand dollars would be paid to him. By the time the police identify the car with the broken <b>headlight</b> and <b>trim</b> pieces, Ogilvie would be out of New Orleans. The travel was supposedly on Thursday night at 1 am. Ogilvie gets a written note from the Duchess asking for permission to drive her car out of garage in case the garage officer asks for it. The moment he is driving the car out of hotel, Peter enters the hotel and they make eye contact, though Peter did not think much of it at the time. However, recollecting all the events - a Jaguar being driven by Ogilvie belonging to the Duke and Duchess - the broken headlight of the Jaguar - the fuss created by Duchess about the waiter - all establish a link towards the involvement of the Duke and Duchess. Peter inquires from the garage officer and is informed that Ogilvie had a written note from the Duchess and so was allowed to drive the car away, but somehow the note got misplaced. Peter informed police captain Yolles of the incident, but they could not prove it without any evidence. After working hard, the incinerator officer, responsible for garbage recycling, manages to find the note. When the note is shown to the Duchess, she frowns. The Duke then decides to admit his crime and decides to leave and steps into elevator no 4.|$|R

50|$|Quattro car {{production}} was 11,452 vehicles {{over the period}} 1980-1991, and through this 11 year production span, despite some touch-ups, there were no {{major changes in the}} visual design of the vehicle. For the 1983 model year, the dash was switched from an analogue instrument cluster, to a green digital liquid crystal display (LCD) electronic instrument cluster. This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster. The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a whole new dash layout, new steering wheel design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned at this time. In 1985 the dash changed slightly with harder foam and lost a diagonal stripe, the dash switches were varied slightly and the diff lock pull knob gave way to a two-position turning knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.External styling received very little modification during its production run. Originally, the car had a flat fronted grille featuring four separate headlamplenses, one for each of the low and high beam units. This was altered for the 1983 model year, and replaced with combined units featuring a single lens, but housing twin reflectors. This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the 'facelift model' and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, <b>headlights,</b> and <b>trim</b> and badging changes. Max speed was 124 mph. The RR 20v Quattro also featured a new three spoke steering wheel design, leather covering for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets. There was also a full length leather-wrapped centre console running {{all the way to the}} rear seats. The 20v was also the first Ur-Q to have 'quattro' script interior with partial leather seats. The floor on the driver's side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl 'quattro' decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated 'Audi', 'Audi rings' and 'quattro' emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated 'Audi rings'.|$|R
