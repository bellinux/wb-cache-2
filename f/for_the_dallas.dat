5|$|In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, {{making the}} team the clear {{favorites}} in the NFL. They {{won the first}} 13 {{games of the season}} and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Cowboys.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E

5|$|Groth {{was looking}} {{to stay in the}} major league in 1948. He spent spring {{training}} on the Indians' roster, and originally made a great impression on the team. However, he was one of seven Indians stricken with dysentery in early April, causing him to miss some time. By the end of spring training, Groth was optioned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, the Indians' AAA-class minor league affiliate. He spent the season with the Orioles, and his pitching performances included a 13–0 victory over the Newark Bears, as well as a 1–0 victory where Groth limited the Bears to three hits. Groth finished the season with Baltimore having amassed 29 pitching appearances, 27 of them starts, a 12–12 record and a 4.48 ERA, while also pitching in two games <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Eagles.
