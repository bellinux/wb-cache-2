40|$|Abstract. A {{residential}} building, a brick/concrete structure {{built up}} in 1990 s was used for many years. Since a deep foundation pit construction was being done in the north, the residents were worrying about {{the cracks in the}} building and its safety. Therefore, the following works were done such as the spot checks of the building engineering quality were done; the test and analysis were carried out over the cracks development after the foundation pit was backfilled, the influence assessment of the foundation construction under the mutual effects of pilings and anchor rods over the residential building structure was also conducted; finally the recheck calculation and safety evaluation were made over the building structure. The result shows that the <b>foundation</b> <b>digging</b> leads to new cracks on the nearby residential building but does not endanger its structural safety; after the foundation was backfilled, the hidden danger on the building’s northern side slop was eliminated and the structure cracks tend to be stable; the complete engineering structure is safe and in conformity with the requirements of safety and anti-vibration during the construction period, however, the multiple-pore slabs ’ piecing affects the structural integrity and vibration proof performance...|$|E

A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A [...] Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base {{with the aid of}} a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary.|$|R

5000|$|... 'Traditional underpinning,' {{the mass}} {{concrete}} underpinning method is nearly 100 years in age, and the protocol has not changed. This underpinning method strengthens an existing structure's <b>foundation</b> by <b>digging</b> boxes by hand underneath and sequentially pouring concrete in a strategic order. The final result {{is basically a}} foundation built underneath the existing foundation. This underpinning method is generally applied when the existing foundation is at a shallow depth, however, the method still works very well even at fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep. The method has not changed since its inception with its use of utilitarian tools such as shovels and post hole diggers. Heavy machinery is not called for in this method due to the tight nature of the boxes being dug. There are several advantages to using this method of underpinning including {{the simplicity of the}} engineering, the low cost of labor to produce the result, and the continuity of the structure's uses during construction.|$|R
50|$|He {{began his}} career as a teacher, {{eventually}} becoming principal of Weston Collegiate Institute in 1899, and in 1901 assistant principal of the Hamilton Street School (now known as Queen Alexandra Middle School). Around that time, he became a building contractor and real estate developer, and quit teaching in 1906 to go into business full-time. During this transition, he had been known to take his students out to the construction sites to <b>dig</b> <b>foundations</b> by shovel. After developing and building over 400 stores and houses east of the Don River by 1920, his real estate properties made him the second-highest taxpayer in Toronto behind Timothy Eaton, the founder of Eaton's.|$|R
50|$|Petnica {{was founded}} at the {{beginning}} of the 15th century. The oldest known written document is Petnica Psalms from 1488, which mentions not only the existence of the village of Petnica, but also the monastery and school there. The Turks burned the monastery in the 18th century, but the church, last renovated in 1864, is still standing. When <b>digging</b> <b>foundations</b> for building stations, excavators discovered the remains of the old cemetery in Petnica ("Bobija") that were transferred to today's church. Today, in the back yard of a large research station in Petnica, there are still two of the three school buildings raised in 1925.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, some Jesuits {{dreamt of}} {{providing}} a university for Dalits within 25 years. The dream began to materialize rather sooner when the funds were found to <b>dig</b> <b>foundations</b> and start building floor by floor. The first classrooms were occupied in 2012 and the building was completed three years later. This building represents a culmination of the Jesuits' vision for elevating and empowering the Dalits. Since the Mission began the Fathers and teachers have had great belief in the students' abilities that has been, and is being realised {{as a result of}} years of hard work {{on the part of the}} students and their lecturers.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{settlers}} had a chief, {{whose job}} it was to defend the settler generation from danger. It therefore {{stands to reason that}} a castle or fortified building must have stood near the village. In the meadowlands below the village, called [...] "Im Burggipfel" [...] or [...] "Am Burggipfel", sandstone foundations may be found, still stuck in the ground. Local inhabitants reported having dug these up in the countryside, and gave accounts of having seen <b>foundations.</b> Some <b>digging</b> unearthed sandstone walls, about 40 cm thick, and it was realized that they once had enclosed a yard of about 40 m². Furthermore, some sandstone slabs were identified, which had once marked a forecourt, as was a gateway arch, near which were found horseshoes and horses' bones. The entrance to the castle must have faced towards the village. The Riedesel Archive yields the information that the ruins, still recognizable in the 18th century as a Schultheiß's [...] "dilapidated stately home", were cleared away. It seems likely that it was a castle with a moat, the more so as the surrounding area of meadowland is still crossed by several streams, and as some places are boggy moorland. However, documentary evidence for this castle is very scanty.|$|R
50|$|Eastwood left Fort Ord in {{the spring}} of 1952 and moved back up to Seattle where he worked as a {{lifeguard}} for some time. However, as he had little money and few friends in Seattle, he moved down to Los Angeles. During this time he worked managing an apartment house in Beverly Hills by day (into which he then moved) and worked at a Signal Oil gas station by night. In June 1953, Eastwood met 22-year-old secretary Margaret Neville Johnson on a blind date. They married shortly before Christmas 1953 in South Pasadena with friend Harry Pendleton as his best man, and honeymooned in Carmel. After concluding his part-time work, he briefly attended Los Angeles City College and held several jobs <b>digging</b> <b>foundations</b> for residential swimming pools, which he continued in between his early films.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was on the}} day {{on which}} they were expected, when the workmen were <b>digging</b> <b>foundations,</b> and {{clearing}} away rubbish, that the foreman begged Mr. Winslow {{to come out to}} see something they had found. [...] Clarence came back, very grave and awe-struck. It was an old oak chest, and within lay a skeleton, together with a few fragments of female clothing, a wedding ring, and some coins of the later Stewarts, in a rotten leathern purse. This was ghastly confirmation, though {{there was nothing else to}} connect the bones with poor Margaret. We had some curiosity as to the coffin in the niche in the family vault which bore her name, but both Clarence and Mr. Fordyce shrank from investigations which could not be carried out without publicity, and might perhaps have disturbed other remains.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the application of}} Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) control to the Lancaster University Computerised Intelligent Excavator (LUCIE), which is being developed to <b>dig</b> <b>foundation</b> trenches on a building site. Previous work using LUCIE {{was based on the}} ubiquitous PI/PID control algorithm, tuned on-line, and implemented in a rather ad hoc manner. By contrast, the present research utilizes new hardware and advanced model-based control system design methods to improve the joint control and so provide smoother, more accurate movement of the excavator arm. In this article, a novel nonlinear simulation model of the system is developed for MATLAB/SIMULINK, allowing for straightforward refinement of the control algorithm and initial evaluation. The PIP controller is compared with a conventionally tuned PID algorithm, with the final designs implemented on-line for the control of dipper angle. The simulated responses and preliminary implementation results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach...|$|R

5000|$|After 1830, {{residential}} development took {{place to the}} east of St John’s Church along the northern side of the precinct. This construction cut into the Priory burial grounds, most significantly Regency Priory Crescent (originally known as [...] "New Crescent"). Despite its grand façade, this collection of houses is somewhat random at the back {{with a wide range of}} rear elevations. The individual gardens of Priory Crescent end at a private lane to the south which is linked to the original path connecting the Gatehouse to the Priory. This Gatehouse was rotated 90 degrees and moved just a few metres from its original location in order to widen the road. The current gate is the smaller arch that pedestrians would have walked through, rather than the larger one (used for traffic such as horses and carts). The builders sold the human bones, teeth and skulls that they excavated whilst <b>digging</b> <b>foundations.</b> Priory Street was built in several stages with Mount Street projected southwards into the Priory precinct.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the work on this project {{was placed in the}} hands of Peter Kerr who designed the building and who acted as Clerk of Works. Most active members contributed their own brand of labouring towards the building - either in <b>digging</b> <b>foundations,</b> laying floors and joists, and other less specialist building jobs. The more sophisticated work, plumbing, brick laying, roofing, etc., was given out on a contract basis, so in the end the building cost what, even in 1960, was the ridiculous figure of about £4,500. The design allowed for future development and improvements and it is to the eternal credit of those involved in the original project that we have such a fine clubhouse today. Also in 1959, Roger Markland joined the Club and in his years at Moor was a prolific points-scorer and contributed to many of the Club's activities. He was also very involved in the building of the present pavilion.|$|R
6000|$|Close by the Lion of Lucerne is {{what they}} call the [...] "Glacier Garden"--and it is {{the only one in the}} world. It is on high ground. Four or five years ago, some workmen who were <b>digging</b> <b>foundations</b> for a house came upon this {{interesting}} relic of a long-departed age. Scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon. The soil was removed, and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey. This track was perforated by huge pot-shaped holes in the bed-rock, formed by the furious washing-around in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers. These huge round boulders still remain in the holes; they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in those old days.|$|R
50|$|About 1834 {{he started}} the study and the {{geological}} investigation of his region - Sarthe and Mayenne. He never stopped working on them until his death. These investigations, and discussions with Louis Cordier, drove him to Anjou (Maine-et-Loire)where coal was craft mined. Thus, in 1839, Triger seriously began {{to look at the}} Loire river and the way to reach solid rock underneath about 20 meters of water lodged soil. After having read many articles on compressed air, he was convinced that he could use it in order to dig through this layer of soil. His success does not lie on the idea of using compressed air, but in the invention of the airlock - to pass from the compressed zone to the zone of ambient air pressure. And especially the finding of a practical way to utilize the technique on an industrial scale. With the financial and administrative support of Emmanuel de Las Cases, 5 steel tubes (the definitive shaft lining) were drilled by this invention, which was subsequently adapted and applied over and over again to <b>dig</b> <b>foundations,</b> bridges and many tunnels.|$|R

By 1988 the school had 300 students. The curriculum, which is determined by the Ministry, includes English, Swahili, geography, history, agriculture, chemistry, physics, biology, political science, mathematics and religion - Christian, Islamic and Bahá'í studies included, by representatives of different religions. Each student takes part in regularly scheduled activities in self-reliance such as carrying bricks, planting bananas, <b>digging</b> <b>foundations,</b> watering and weeding his own trees, etc. Several of the founding staff were pioneers to Tanzania - one from Iran, [...] one from Lebanon, one from Australia, and three from America. There was also local staff hired as teachers. The school is affiliated with a local teacher training college and also provides services to the local community.|$|R

Then they quarrelled among themselves as to the best way of getting the man out, and the result was that the poor fellow was suffocated, though he might easily have been rescued by prompt action. But that was not the end of it! The relations and friends of the man came down, made Eastern howling and lamentation over him, and laid his corpse at the door of my cottage, holding me responsible for his life, and demanding compensation!

5000|$|His first {{literary}} effort, {{a description}} of the Crown Inn at Rochester and its cellars, was printed with a view and plan in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1789, under the pseudonym of 'Antiquitatis Conservator'. He had previously contributed drawings for one or two plates. In 1795 Denne communicated to the Society of Antiquaries a letter on the subject of watermarks in paper, enclosing drawings by Fisher of sixty-four specimens, together with copies of several autographs and documents discovered by him in a room over the town hall at Rochester. By Fisher's care the records were afterwards placed in proper custody.

50|$|The central {{octagonal}} tower, {{with its}} vast internal {{open space and}} its pinnacles and lantern above, forms the most distinctive and celebrated feature of the cathedral. However, what Pevsner describes as Ely's 'greatest individual achievement of architectural genius' came about through a disaster at {{the centre of the}} Cathedral. On the night of 12-13 February 1322, possibly as a result of <b>digging</b> <b>foundations</b> for the Lady Chapel, the Norman central crossing tower collapsed. Work on the Lady Chapel was suspended as attention transferred to dealing with this disaster. Instead of being replaced by a new tower on the same ground plan, the crossing was enlarged to an octagon, removing all four of the original tower piers and absorbing the adjoining bays of the nave, chancel and transepts to define an open area far larger than the square base of the original tower. The construction of this unique and distinctive feature was overseen by Alan of Walsingham. The extent of his influence on the design continues {{to be a matter of}} debate, as are the reasons such a radical step was taken. Mistrust of the soft ground under the failed tower piers may have been a major factor in moving all the weight of the new tower further out. The large stone octagonal tower, with its eight internal archways, leads up to spectacular timber fan-vaulting that appears to allow the large glazed timber lantern to balance on their slender struts. The roof and lantern are actually held up by a complex timber structure above the vaulting which could not be built in this way today because there are no trees big enough. The central lantern, also octagonal in form, but with angles offset from the great Octagon, has panels showing pictures of musical angels, which can be opened, with access from the Octagon roof-space, so that real choristers can sing from on high. More wooden vaulting forms the lantern roof. At the centre is a wooden boss carved from a single piece of oak, showing Christ in Majestry. The elaborate joinery and timberwork was brought about by William Hurley, master carpenter in the royal service.|$|R
