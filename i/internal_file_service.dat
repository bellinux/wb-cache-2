5000|$|When Musson's lease expired, the 24-hour {{restaurant}} and nightclub relocated in May 1962 aboard the Charles Van Damme, a decommissioned paddlewheel ferryboat docked at Waldo Point. [...] Before {{the end of}} the year, Musson ran into financial trouble when the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Service</b> <b>filed</b> a $4,497 lien against the business for failure to pay employee withholding taxes. Her difficulties were compounded when the ferryboat's owner Donlon T. Arques filed for eviction of the restaurant for non-payment of rent. The restaurant made front-page headlines on March 16, 1963, when a late-night 40-person melee erupted between a motorcycle club and other patrons; weapons included car jacks, pipes, steel bars, furniture, and a fishbowl. Several people were arrested, and one person was taken to the hospital after being hit in the head with an axe. Musson shut down the restaurant in April after being cited for non-compliance with sanitation laws, and improper sewage disposal. Juanita's Galley was finally evicted from the ferryboat in July. Following her eviction, a $250,000 lawsuit was filed against Musson by the motorcycle club member who had been hit in the head with an axe during the March brawl. In late 1963, a $30,000 lawsuit was filed against her by a woman who claimed to have been injured in a fall at the restaurant.|$|R
