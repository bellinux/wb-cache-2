5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France {{during the second half of}} the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely <b>evoked</b> <b>by</b> the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{was celebrated}} by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous {{retrospective}} exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power <b>evoked</b> <b>by</b> his work {{led directly to}} Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio {{was a friend of}} Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is <b>evoked</b> <b>by</b> Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E

Namely, permutation (immutatio) and addition (adiectio).|$|R

5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is <b>evoked</b> <b>by</b> light which triggers the medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570nm.|$|E

Anxiety in turn affects acute pain, such that heightened anxiety reduces pain threshold, which may limit a physician’s ability {{to complete a}} procedure. Anxiety and pain experienced by patients prior to and during {{medical procedures}} also impact negatively on postoperative outcomes, e. g., post-operative pain, poorer recovery, increased analgesic use, increased physical complaints, and reduced immune function (e. g., Kain et al., 2000; Kielcolt-Glaser et al., 1998; Osborn & Sandler, 2004) ...|$|R
5000|$|Describing the {{phenomenon}} of witnessing several prominent Bay Area theorists using body art {{and other types of}} performance to demonstrate the gaps between subcultural concerns and dominant cultural assumptions, Linwood coined the term “Stand Up Theory” to highlight how these performance artists highjacked the mic to seduce, ambush, and educate their audiences. Linwood’s sculptural works deploy these strategies. Of Initiation, a sculpture referencing AIDS and made of honey, Tamblyn wrote, “The piece adroitly expressed the melancholic sensibility that the disease <b>evokes</b> <b>by</b> capitalizing on honey’s association with seduction, entrapment and preservation.” ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1906, Picasso {{followed}} his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art.

25|$|Conventional SSEPs {{monitor the}} {{functioning}} of the part of the somatosensory system involved in sensations such as touch and vibration. The part of the somatosensory system that transmits pain and temperature signals is monitored using laser evoked potentials (LEP). LEPs are <b>evoked</b> <b>by</b> applying finely focused, rapidly rising heat to bare skin using a laser. In the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract, lateral brain stem, and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex. In the peripheral nervous system pain and heat signals are carried along thin (C and A delta) fibers to the spinal cord, and LEPs can be used to determine whether a neuropathy is located in these small fibers as opposed to larger (touch, vibration) fibers.|$|E
