Digestion of PC waste in alkylene glycols, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>ethylene</b> glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG), with a catalytic amount of sodium carbonate at 180 degrees C under normal atmospheric pressure afforded partial alkoxylation products of BPA. This initial product mixture was found to consist of BPA (28 %) and monohydroxyethyl ether (MHE-BPA, 40 %) and bishydroxyethyl ether of bisphenol A (BHE-BPA, 25 %) when digested in EG solution. Whereas, in PG digestion solution, the corresponding digestion products consist of monohydroxypropyl ether of BPA (MHP-BPA, 53 %) and bishydroxypropyl ether of BPA (BHP-BPA, 21 %), with the rest being un-propoxylated BPA. When these digested solutions were further treated with molar excess of urea with a catalytic amount of zinc oxide at 180 degrees C, BHE from EG or BHP-BPA from PG was produced in high yields.

In the work reported, {{the effect of the}} addition of a rubbery phase, i. <b>e.</b> <b>ethylene</b> - propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) or poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB), on the properties of PHB was studied. The effects of rubber type and of changing the PHB/elastomer blend processing method on the crystallinity and physical properties of the blends were also investigated. For blends based on PHB, the main role of EPDM is its nucleating effect evidenced by a decrease of crystallization temperature and an increase of crystallinity with increasing EPDM content regardless of the processing route. While EPDM has a weak effect on PHB glass transition temperature, PVB induces a marked decrease of this temperature thank to its plasticizer that swells the PHB amorphous phase. A promising solution to improve the mechanical properties of PHB seems to be the melt-processing of PHB with both plasticizer and EPDM. In fact, the plasticizer is more efficient than the elastomer in decreasing the PHB glass transition temperature and, because of the nucleating effect of EPDM, the decrease of the PHB modulus due to the plasticizer can be counterbalanced.

Treatment of H-ZSM- 34 with a Na(2) H(2) EDTA (EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetate) aqueous solution followed by ion exchange and calcination enhanced the catalytic performance significantly. The selectivity to lower olefins increased significantly for certain Na(2) H(2) EDTA aqueous solution concentrations; when the H-ZSM- 34 catalyst was treated with a 0. 1 mol/L Na(2) H(2) EDTA solution, the selectivity and yield of C- 2 -C- 4 olefins reached 82 % and 61 %, respectively, at 673 K and a CH 3 Cl partial pressure of 9. 2 kPa. The modification of H-ZSM- 34 with Ce ions improved C- 2 -C- 4 olefin selectivity and yield.

The key strategy {{relies on the}} optimum combination of cells with a suitable biodegradable matrix that could support the cell viability and remodelling of tissues. In tissue engineering, hydrogels, 3 D network of hydrophilic polymers, have received much attention due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, structural similarity to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Driven by enormous potential of hydrogels, we have developed a novel gelatin (G) -based hydrogel with tunable mechanical, degradation and biological properties. Chitosan (CH) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) were added to better match the native ECM composition and mechanical properties {{as well as to}} tailor the degradation resistance and available cell binding motifs. The effects of different material composition on physico-chemical properties, mechanical behaviour, cell adhesion and viability were evaluated. Materials and methods: G-PEG hydrogel was prepared in aqueous solutions following a synthetic procedure which involves the reaction between gelatin amino-groups and the functional end groups of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).

Up to now no growth regulator has emerged with a primary role similar to that played by ethylene in the ripening of the climacteric fruits. Strawberries can produce ethylene, although in limited amounts. Two cDNAs coding for enzymes of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway (i. e. FaACO 1 and FaACO 2), and three cDNAs encoding different ethylene receptors have been isolated. Two receptors (i. e. FaEtr 1 and FaErs 1) belong to the type-I while the third (i. e. FaEtr 2) belongs to the type-II group. The expression of both the ACO and the receptor-encoding genes has been studied in fruits at different stages of development and in fruits treated with hormones (i. <b>e.</b> <b>ethylene</b> and the auxin analogue NAA). All the data thus obtained have been correlated to the known data about ethylene production by strawberry fruits. Interestingly, a good correlation has resulted between the expression of the genes described in this work and the data of ethylene production. In particular, similarly to what occurs during climacteric fruit ripening, there is an increased synthesis of receptors concomitant with the increased synthesis of ethylene in strawberries as well. Moreover, the receptors mostly expressed in ripening strawberries are the type-II ones, that is those with a degenerate histidine-kinase domain. Since the latter domain is thought to establish a weaker link to the CTR 1 proteins, even the little ethylene produced by ripening strawberries might be sufficient to trigger ripening-related physiological responses...|$|R

Two concepts based on the same general process layout are considered: (i) via methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) synthesis; (ii) via direct dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis and DME-to-olefins (DTO) synthesis. The work is based on process models established in Aspen Plus to obtain mass and energy balances. Heat recovery targets for integration of a steam network for combined heat and power production are investigated using pinch analysis tools. The different process alternatives are compared in terms of energy efficiency (?en). Additionally, to identify key process differences, the cold gas efficiency (?cg,i) and carbon conversion (Cconv,i) from biomass feedstock to various intermediate products along the process value chain are compared. The results show that light olefins could be produced with an energy efficiency of approximately 52 – 54 % (higher heating value (HHV) basis) using methanol and DME as platform chemicals. The two investigated concepts had similar cold gas efficiency along the process value chain and overall electricity balance. Accordingly, no significant thermodynamic difference could be identified for the two investigated cases. One interesting feature that is identified is that the same amount of the renewable carbon in the feedstock is lost, mainly as CO 2, regardless of whether the methanol or DME route is adopted. The difference is where in the process value chain most of the CO 2 is formed and removed. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineer...|$|R

Conclusions are reached as to degradation mechanisms and effects, methods for the elimination of these mechanisms, selection of copper alloy combustion chamber liners, and hydrocarbon fuel purchase specifications...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} anilido–imine {{chromium}} complexes {{have been used}} as precursors to catalyze homo- and copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene. The chromium complexes activated with methylalumoxane (MAO) exhibit good activities for homopolymerization of <b>ethylene</b> (<b>E)</b> to produce linear polyethylene and moderate activities for norbornene (N) polymerization to afford vinyl-type polynorbornene. Ethylene–norbornene copolymers with high incorporation of norbornene can be also produced by these catalysts. 13 C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses show that the copolymers are random products, and –NNN– and –EEE– units can be observed in the microstructure of the copolymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis {{of seven}} methylated aliphatic epoxides - R 1 R 2 C(O) CR 3 R 4 (A: R 1 =R 2 =R 3 =R 4 =H; B: R 1 =R 2 =R 3 =H, R 4 =Me; C: R 1 =R 2 =H, R 3 =R 4 =Me; D: R 1 =R 3 =H, R 2 =R 4 =Me(trans); E: R 1 =R 3 =H, R 2 =R 4 =Me(cis); F: R 1 =R 3 =R 4 =Me, R 2 =H; G: R 1 =R 2 =R 3 =R 4 =Me) - {{has been studied}} at 36 ± 1. 5 °C. Compounds with two methyl groups at the same carbon atom of the oxirane ring exhibit highest rate constants (k(eff) in reciprocal molar concentration per second: 11. 0 ± 1. 3 for C, 10. 7 ± 2. 1 for F, and 8. 7 ± 0. 7 for G as opposed to 0. 124 ± 0. 003 for B, 0. 305 ± 0. 003 for D, and 0. 635 ± 0. 036 for <b>E).</b> <b>Ethylene</b> oxide (A) displays the lowest rate of hydrolysis (0. 027 M- 1 s- 1). The {{results are consistent with}} literature data available for compounds A, B, and C. To model the reactivities we have employed quantum chemical calculations (MNDO, AM 1, PM 3, and MINDO/ 3) of the main reaction species. There is a correlation of the logarithm k(eff) with the total energy of epoxide ring opening. The best correlation coefficients (r) were obtained using the AM 1 and MNDO methods (0. 966 and 0. 957, respectively). However, unlike MNDO, AM 1 predicts approximately zero energy barriers for the oxirane ring opening of compounds B, C, E and G, which is not consistent with published kinetic data. Thus, the MNDO method provides a preferential means of modeling the acidic hydrolysis of the series of methylated oxiranes. The general ranking of mutagenicity in vitro, A > B > C, is in line with the concept that this sequence also gradually leaves the expoxide reactivity optimal for genotoxicity toward reactivities leading to higher biological detoxifications...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel, as an {{alternative}} fuel, is gradually receiving more popularity for use in internal combustion engines. However questions continue to arise with regard to its compatibility with elastomeric materials. The present work aims to investigate the comparative degradation of physical properties for different elastomers <b>e.</b> g. <b>ethylene</b> propylene diene monomer (EPDM), silicone rubber (SR), polychloroprene (CR), polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) and nitrile rubber (NBR) upon exposure to diesel and palm biodiesel. Static immersion tests in B 0 (diesel), B 10 (10 % biodiesel in diesel), B 20, B 50 and B 100 (biodiesel) were carried out at room temperature (25 degrees C) for 1000 h. Different physical properties like, changes in weight and volume, hardness and tensile strength were measured at every 250 h of immersion time. Compositional changes in biodiesel due to exposure of different elastomers were investigated by Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). The overall sequence of compatible elastomers in palm biodiesel {{is found to be}} PTFE > SR > NBR > EPDM > CR. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
