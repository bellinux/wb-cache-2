We propose a flexible zoning concept, built up around economic and technical layers, in networks of the order of hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes.

The Economic Layer delivers suggestions after a fixed ordering, starting with suppliers and demands that generates the lowest overall system cost, then second-lowest overall network cost etc. These suggestions are delivered to the Technical Layer that checks for feasibility in terms of technical constraints. The first match between the ranked suggestions and non-violation of technical constraints is chosen. We demonstrate why this paper should be considered for future power systems.

However, the <b>economic</b> <b>zoning</b> of Russia, played a great {{role in the development of}} the economic potential of the USSR, largely out of date. Many regions were formed over 70 years ago, they did not contribute to the formation of new market structures, do not consider social and environmental features of the territory, and poor fit with natural boundaries.

So several different classification areas, taking into account both socio- economic and natural features of the area in terms of market reforms are suggested. Central region - historical, political, economic center of the country. It includes 27 subjects of the Russian Federation. North region actually coincides with the same area, which had existed previously. It consists of 5 subjects of the Federation. South region - the breadbasket of Russia, comprising 10 federal subjects. The North Caucasus region - the smallest and most multicultural area of Russia.

Western Siberia region - an area of new development - the main oil-gas region of Russia, consisting of 8 subjects of the Federation.

The first approach involves the analysis of the process of placing the concentration of businesses and industries move from one region to another, and the second - was built on the principles of respect to the uniform placement of economic activity in the space. It was noted at the present time there is a certain complexity of the transition from a regional to a spatial approach. This is reflected {{in the absence of a}} clear understanding of theoretical foundations. In the first approach, the terms used most frequently: the approach to the production of sources of raw materials, fuel, energy, and places of consumption of finished products; concentration of production processes in certain areas. And in the second - even distribution of production on the territory of the country; specialization economy of certain regions in order to maximize the effect of the territorial division of labor; comprehensive economic development of regions. Created <b>economic</b> <b>zoning</b> is the most successful attempt of territorial management reforms in Russia. The most responsive to the needs of society, its various social layers of life and economy. There is maximum registration of economic factors: transport and economic links between the regions and within them, with the necessary respect for the principles of specialization areas and the complexity of their development. But at the same time, the departmental management approach has created disunity of various modes of transport, poor transport services economic complex, a large backlog in the development of transport hubs etc. Currently the persistent hostility is overcome to such terms as "plan", "specialization", and “intensification". Scientific research focuses on the synthesis of planned and market institutions, where the factors stimulating the development of port infrastructure, act now not only as a natural resource, economic and social, economic, but as the market factors also. It is concluded that it is important to identify the most significant factors influencing the economic growth of the region.

Two different aspects are used in this context: an investigation on what is offered and, complementary to this, what is demanded. This approach might serve for a delimitation of buffer-zones and, in a broader sense, a methodology for <b>economic</b> <b>zoning</b> (2 ̆ 7 zonificación económica 2 ̆ 7) and spatial occupation (2 ̆ 7 ocupación del territorio 2 ̆ 7), two planning instruments frequently discussed in Bolivia and Peru. The southern buffer-zone of the Amboró National Park (Departamento Sta. Cruz / Bolivia) serves as a case study. For that reason, a summary of regional characteristics is presented: population, land use and land tenure, social and economic infrastructure, principal objectives of development planning on the Departamento and the Province level. The following aspects can be resumed as main findings: - The study region is situated closely {{to one of the}} most dynamic economic centers, Sta. Cruz, and on the basis of functional relations depends on this center. The high intensity of transport to and from Sta. Cruz reflects this very well. - Considering the number of villages located very closely to the National Park and the changes of its boundaries, it seems that the protected area was interpreted as a land reserve for colonization projects in the future. - The existing planning documents show a well developed basis for environmental planning. It is worth mentioning especially the case of the Florida Province Development Plan. - With reference to the internal spatial structure four sub-centers were identified: Los Negros, Mairana, Samaipata and Comarapa. Whereas Los Negros and Mairana assumed the function of economic centers, the principle administrative functions as well banking facilities and (limited) possibilities of higher education are still concentrated in Samaipata and Comarapa, the main colonial settlements of the region. Due to its intensive relations to the villages on the National Park boarder, all of them should be integrated in a future buffer-zone. - Tourism is concentrated around Samaipata, eco- tourism is still a rather exceptional activity in the region. - The institutional landscape of the region show a number of regional based institutions, an interesting potential for a self-determined development process. Finally, recommendations are presented to extend multidisciplinary investigations on buffer-zones in the future. The study forms part of a comparative investigation on different regions in the eastern slope of the Andes.

40|$|Changing {{economic}} {{production processes}} {{have opened up}} new locational demands for firms and have led to an increasingly diverse firm population displaying fragmented location patterns. This research focuses on those spatial configurations that fit the current economic fragmentation and changing location decisions. It does so by studying {{the factors that influence}} the location behaviour of firms in urban residential neighbourhoods in the Netherlands. The thesis connects the neighbourhood economy with the increasingly flexible and mobile ways entrepreneurs go about their business. The thesis is the first to thoroughly address the role of real estate characteristics in the (re) location choices of these neighbourhood firms. First, the research demonstrates that the type of <b>economic</b> <b>zoning</b> in the local land-use plan can be linked to the location pattern of local firms. Our analyses showed that a more lenient regulatory framework was related to a higher amount of and potential for local economic activities. Second, the research demonstrates that the structure of the neighbourhood housing stock can be linked to the location pattern of local firms. We showed that real estate factors such as property ownership, size and age {{play an important role in}} explaining the relocation likelihood of firms. These real estate factors are not generally accounted for in research on the revealed relocation decisions of firms, but deserve a place of their own alongside the more often controlled for factors such as firm sector and size. Overall, the results show that real estate and neighbourhood characteristics are related to the general (re) location behaviour of firms. However, such general tendencies are only a minor part of the story. Along with the fact that there is heterogeneity among urban residential neighbourhoods, these areas also house a very heterogeneous firm population displaying different locational behaviours. When studying the location behaviour of firms in urban residential neighbourhood, this research indicates that it is necessary to differentiate between firms housed in residential properties (Home Based Bussinesses (HBBs)) opposed to Firms located in Commercial Properties (FCPs). First, with an average yearly relocation probability of 7. 1 %, HBBs are more mobile than FCPs, of which 3. 7 % relocated on an annual basis. Second, when differentiating between HBBs and FCPs, we noted that these two groups of firms occasionally valued location factors in opposing ways. Not differentiating between firms in commercial and residential properties would nullify these interaction effects. Third, while firms in commercial properties largely confined to the more classical economic location factors, HBB relocations are motivated by different types of factors. For home based-based businesses, the incorporation of work-lifestyle characteristics, rather than the explanatory variables more commonly used in locational analysis, seems to provide an explanation. Ultimately, we advocate that these increasingly fragmented locational behaviours of firms deserve greater attention in locational analyses and firm location theory. With regard local economic policies aimed at creating a desirable local business climate the results suggest that place-based policies can be considered an effective tool in attracting firms that want to relocate to commercial properties. Real estate-based policies and flexibility in land-use zoning can be attractive policy initiatives for facilitating both the commercial and residential property based firms. Overall, these policy initiatives should reiterate the current economic profile of the neighbourhood and fit the local economic context...|$|E
40|$|O grande potencial de crescimento da produção de cana-de-açúcar no Brasil e da demanda internacional por etanol implica no consequente aumento da demanda por recursos Ambientais e na geração de significativos impactos ambientais. Dentre os indispensáveis mecanismos de controle a que estão sujeitas essas atividades, destaca-se o licenciamento {{ambiental}}, que deve ser antecedido pela realização de estudos ambientais que irão subsidiar a decisão do órgão ambiental. Nesse contexto, o Estudo de Impacto Ambiental, previsto no artigo 225, § 1 º., IV, da Constituição Federal, é um dos mais importantes instrumentos de avaliação de impactos socioambientais e tem por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade ambiental e de alternativas de empreendimentos causadores de significativo impacto ambiental, mediante análise de suas diferentes etapas. A Resolução CONAMA 01 / 86 constitui {{a principal}} regulamentação do EIA, estando ali previsto um rol de atividades para as quais se exige esse estudo, oqual é vinculado ao licenciamento ambiental. Apesar disso, verifica-se que o EIA tem sido dispensado pelo órgão ambiental estadual de Minas Gerais, com substrato no Zoneamento Ecológico Econômico de Minas Gerais, para o licenciamentoambiental prévio da atividade de destilaria de álcool, a qual é causadora de significativo impacto ambiental e está arrolada no inciso XII do artigo 2 º. da Resolução anteriormente mencionada. Diante desse quadro, o presente trabalho buscou, com base em processos de licenciamento ambiental e outros documentos disponíveis no órgão ambiental estadual, analisar a dispensa do EIA para o licenciamento prévio de empreendimentos sucroalcooleiros situados na região do Triângulo Mineiro e Alto Paranaíba, principal áreade expansão desse setorno Estado de Minas Gerais. Os resultados permitiram observar que a dispensa do EIA não se fundamenta em critérios técnicos nem científicos, bem como não encontra amparo legal, posto que os instrumentos da PNMA devem se relacionar e não se sobreporem. Ademais, para o estudo ambiental exigido (RCA) em substituição ao EIA foram identificadas deficiências consistentes na ausência de estudo de alternativas tecnológicas e locacionais e de identificação dos impactos cumulativos e sinérgicos. Também foram apontadas repercussões de natureza legal, haja vista que o licenciamento, o EIA e o ZEE estão vinculados porlei. __________________________________________________________________________________________ABSTRACT: The potential for increased production of cane sugar in Brazil and in international demand for ethanol means a consequent increase {{in demand for}} environmental resources and the generation of significant environmental impacts. Among the necessary control mechanisms that are subject to these activities, we highlight the environmental permit, which must be preceded by environmental studies that will assist {{the decision of the}} environmental agency. In this context, the Environmental Impact Study, provided in Article 225, § 1 º., IV, the Federal Constitution, {{is one of the most}} important tools for assessing impacts and aims at studying the environmental feasibility of alternative enterprises and causing significant environmental impact, through analysis of its different stages. The CONAMA Resolution 01 / 86 provides the main rules of the EIA, there being provided a list of activities for which it requires that study, which is linked to environmental licensing. Nevertheless, it appears that the EIA has been waivedby the state environmental agency of Minas Gerais, with substrate in Ecological and <b>Economic</b> <b>Zoning</b> of Minas Gerais, for the previous environmental licensing activity alcohol distillery, which is causing significant environmental impact and is enrolled in section XII of Article 2. aforementioned Resolution. Given this situation, this study sought, based on environmental licensing and other documents available at the state environmental agency, review the waiver of the EIA for the sugar and alcohol prior licensing of enterprises located in the Triangle Mineiro and Alto Paranaíba, main area expansion of this sector in the State of Minas Gerais. The results showed that the dispensation of the EIAis not based on scientific or technical criteria, and finds no legal grounds, since the tools of PNMA should not overlap and relate to. Moreover, for environmental assessment required (RCA) replacing the EIA were identified deficiencies in the absence of consistent study of alternative technological and location and identification of cumulative impacts and synergistic. Also were reported to legal implications, given that licensing, EIA and the ZEE are bound by law...|$|E
40|$|Extended abstracts 1 - IntroductionMost {{organizations}} and financial institutions are facing with spatial decision makings. Optimum decision making affects the institutes’ success, achievement to their objectives and attracting customers. Modern banking services have evolved {{by the development}} of modern technologies. The most sensible aspect of banking services evolution is based on using the modern technologies of ATMs. The rapid growth in application of these devices could have been caused by the increasing acceptance of them among customers (Foukerdi, 2005 : 2). Because of the same reason, in spite of the high costs of purchase, initiation and maintenance, banks, financial and credit institutions are still interested in the development of ATMs. On the other hand, inattention and mismanagement in site selection and the number of such devices could be effective in failure of these systems. Selecting the optimum and most proper location to install the ATMs takes into account with respect to various factors that have different impact factors. Economical zoning of the cities for selecting potential and capable locations of such activities is assumed as the success agent of institutions and is a powerful method for future decisions. Therefore, the overall purpose of this research is to provide a model for <b>economic</b> <b>zoning</b> to install the services and facilities of banking system (ATMs). The research type is developmental- applied and the research method is descriptive-analytical. In the first step, effective economic factors in banking system were specified throughout library studies (previous studies) with respect to research purposes, then it was supplemented by expert’s viewpoints, also, spatial data were obtained from area by surveying with respect to relevant criteria. Weight of each criterion was specified with Analytic Network Process (ANP) after supplement of couple comparison circular by experts and it was used in Gray cluster analysis for spatial modeling and zoning based on radius of influence. The Software “Super Decision” was used for computations of ANP mode and ArcGIS 9. 3 was used for spatial analysis and modeling. Then current state of bank departments’ installation and their ATM numbers were analyzed and eventually the model was evaluated based on field observation and expert’s viewpoints. This process was conducted on 153 branches of 22 banks in part of Tehran city, including regions 6, 11 and 12, that is focused. 2 - Theoretical basesElectronic banking is one of the substantial aspects of the revolution in ICT in economy (Goodarzi & Zobaidie, 2008 : 114). Experts believe that the banks’ best strategy for competition in future world is to equip with IT and electronic servicing. Over the past two decades, significant growth of the clients’ welcome to the electronic banking services has forced the banks to exert and propose a new culture of banking services in community by electronic banking. One of the most important technical innovations in this regard is the invention of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The importance of the applicability of these machines is due to their different financial services, from cashing to bills payment, without a fulltime cashier or other fulltime staffs (Foukerdi, 2005 : 3, 4 & 15). Clients prefer to use ATMs services instead of going into bank branches because the banks are overcrowded. However, this occurs if these machines are working properly and are in the suitable location (Bamdad & Rafie, 2009 : 41 & 42). The proper location has {{a significant role in the}} increasing acceptance of ATMs. 3 - Discussion The research implement stages to achieve its goals are:The first step: In order to identify the economic criteria and sub-criteria in economic classification, some questionnaires were provided after library studies and the assessment of researchers were carried out earlier (Goli & et al, 2010 : 99), then the questionnaire was supplemented by experts and their relationships was identified. The second step: codification of the ANP modelIn this step, the weight of each criterion and sub-criterion was specified using Analytic Network Process model. Final weights of each criterion and sub-criterion using ANP modelDemand/ConsumptionMunicipal Services and FacilitiesTransport and TrafficEconomic and CommercialPopulationSanitary and remedialRecreationalAdministrativeEducational and CulturalTrafficTransport 0. 2646870. 1052180. 1540340. 0611660. 1131130. 0447110. 0896720. 167398 The third step: spatial modeling and classification using the Gray method. In this step in order to determine the potential influence radius of an ATM in a given area a model proposed by Kyter were used to select the location of ATMs and the study area was zoned in four classes using Gray method. 4 - ConclusionClass one is the most suitable economic class for placement of bank branches and offering their services and facilities (ATMs) due to the high influence radius. Other classes are in a lower level of economic importance respectively. The results show, regardless of pathways status, more than 22 percent of study area is in class one and 21 percent is in class two and proportions of classes three and four are 31 and 27 percent, respectively. This classification helps bank managers, programmers and financial institutes to analyze the region to specify the economic proper places for construction of new branches and installation of ATMs. The results of banks and ATMs assessment in the district, by adding their information layers on the final map showed that 43 percent of banks, financial and credit institutes are in class 1 and other classes encompassed 11, 27 and 19 percent of branches respectively. Current installation of 153 branch of 22 banks and financial and credit institutions with the number of ATMs of each branch in the four classes are displayed in tables. Results from these tables help bank managers and programmers of financial and credit institutes in recognition of their current status against other competitors to current and future programming. It also helps them in allotting the ATMs to each of branches according to the location of the ATMs located or modifying them in unfavorable branches and transfer to other branches. Moreover, based on field studies and experts’ polls, the model was evaluated which 67 percent of the experts assessed it very proper (very proper) and 33 others assessed it proper (good). Furthermore, to determine the homogeneity between the results derived from the model and the field studies, the Gamma coefficient was calculated which indicated a coefficient equal to 0. 893. 5 - SuggestionsAccording to the importance of banks and financial and credit institutions and their increase along recent years and their dependence to the establishment site, few studies about the importance of location decisions and its influence on banking system and financial and credit institutions have taken place. The model presented in this study assesses the ATMs of each bank branches with regard to their installation location and determines the criteria used in it with respect to the study scale. This discussion needs to be studied in other levels such as province and then for each county to allocate banking services and facilities by identifying the effective factors in each level against other competitors while analyzing current status and gain highest profitability. Other important subject it in this context is improper distribution of bank branches and facilities offered by the banks to their clients that causes a loss in their customer level. Some studies seem to be required in context of spatial distribution.
