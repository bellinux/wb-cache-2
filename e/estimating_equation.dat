40|$|We {{introduce}} a flexible marginal modelling approach for statistical inference for clustered and longitudinal data under minimal assumptions. This <b>estimated</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> approach is semiparametric {{and the proposed}} models are fitted by quasi-likelihood regression, where the unknown marginal means are {{a function of the}} fixed effects linear predictor with unknown smooth link, and variance-covariance is an unknown smooth function of the marginal means. We propose to estimate the nonparametric link and variance-covariance functions via smoothing methods, whereas the regression parameters are obtained via the <b>estimated</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>equations.</b> These are score equations that contain nonparametric function estimates. The proposed <b>estimated</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> approach is motivated by its flexibility and easy implementation. Moreover, if data follow a generalized linear mixed model, with either a specified or an unspecified distribution of random effects and link function, the model proposed emerges as the corresponding marginal (population-average) version and can be used to obtain inference for the fixed effects in the underlying generalized linear mixed model, without the need to specify any other components of this generalized linear mixed model. Among marginal models, the <b>estimated</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> approach provides a flexible alternative to modelling with generalized <b>estimating</b> <b>equations.</b> Applications of <b>estimated</b> <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> include diagnostics and link selection. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators for the model parameters is derived, enabling statistical inference.

40|$|Statistical methods with {{empirical}} likelihood (EL) {{are appealing}} and effective especially {{in conjunction with}} <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> through which useful data information can be adaptively and flexibly incorporated. It is also known in the literature that EL approaches encounter difficulties when dealing with problems having high-dimensional model parameters and <b>estimating</b> <b>equations.</b> To overcome the challenges, we begin our study with a careful investigation on high-dimensional EL from a new scope targeting at estimating a high-dimensional sparse model parameters. We show that the new scope {{provides an opportunity for}} relaxing the stringent requirement on the dimensionality of the model parameter. Motivated by the new scope, we then propose a new penalized EL by applying two penalty functions respectively regularizing the model parameters and the associated Lagrange multipliers in the optimizations of EL. By penalizing the Lagrange multiplier to encourage its sparsity, we show that drastic dimension {{reduction in the number of}} <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> can be effectively achieved without compromising the validity and consistency of the resulting estimators. Most attractively, such a reduction in dimensionality of <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> is actually equivalent to a selection among those high-dimensional <b>estimating</b> <b>equations,</b> resulting in a highly parsimonious and effective device for high-dimensional sparse model parameters. Allowing both the dimensionalities of model parameters and <b>estimating</b> <b>equations</b> growing exponentially with the sample size, our theory demonstrates that the estimator from our new penalized EL is sparse and consistent with asymptotically normally distributed nonzero components.

40|$|A local {{likelihood}} estimator for a nonparametric nuisance {{function is}} {{proposed in the}} context of semiparametric skew-normal distributions. Constraints imposed on such functions result in a nonparametric estimator with a different target function for maximization from classical local likelihood estimators. The optimal asymptotic semiparametric efficiency bound on parameters of interest is achieved by using this estimator in conjunction with an <b>estimating</b> <b>equation</b> formed by summing efficient scores. A generalized profile likelihood approach is also proposed. This method has the advantage of providing a unique estimate in cases where an <b>estimating</b> <b>equation</b> has multiple solutions. Our nonparametric estimator of the nuisance function leads to an estimator of the semiparametric skew-normal density.
