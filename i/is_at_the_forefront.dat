The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support {{of a growing number of}} industry leaders based in Connecticut, UConn <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of developing clean, alternative sources of renewable energy using fuel cell technology.

The installation of a ClearEdge Power, former UTC Power, PureCell System is the latest step by UConn to reduce its carbon footprint and build a sustainable community. The fuel cell installation was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticut’s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.|$|E
