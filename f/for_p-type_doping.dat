However, commercialization of ZnO remains in doubt due to great difficulties in achieving stable p-type-doped ZnO because of low doping efficiency [2] and instability of dopant in ZnO [3]. Phosphorus (P) has been proved {{to be one of}} the best dopant <b>for</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doping</b> in ZnO; however, the doping mechanism remains controversial [4]. P has at least two stable configurations: complex (PZn + 2 VZn) formed by combination between antisite substitutional P (PZn) and two zinc vacancies (VZn); substitutional P at oxygen sites (PO) [4]. PZn + 2 VZn were believed to be the effective configuration <b>for</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doping,</b> which induces a shallow acceptor level in the band gap, while PO was suggested to induce relatively deep acceptor level, not resulting in sufficient hole concentration in ZnO. Most of the p-type conductivity observed in P-doped ZnO is attributed to PZn + 2 VZn until now [5, 6] and high resistance of P-doped ZnO is always believed to be induced by PO [7].

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the results of a {{systematic}} investigation of damage generation and accumulation until amorphization induced by 180 keV Ca+ and Ar+ implantation in GaN films at liquid-nitrogen temperature. The structure of GaN films before and after implantation was characterized by Rutherford backscattering/channeling, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution x-ray diffraction. The as-implanted GaN films exhibits an expanded lattice. Its texture was determined by pole figure measurement. An amorphous component has been found after Ca+ implantation at doses not less than 3 × 1014 cm− 2. This suggests that Ca+ implantation <b>for</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doping</b> be carried out below this dose, in order to avoid unrecoverable structural damage and to achieve better transport properties. On the other hand, implantation with higher doses is generally needed to compensate for the native electron background of GaN and to realize p-type reversal. This conflict uncovers the essential difficulty <b>for</b> <b>p-type</b> <b>doping</b> of GaN by ion implantation. The maximum damage concentration exists in a depth of 100 nm below the surface, which corresponds to the mean projected range, and broadens gradually towards surface and greater depth with increasing ion fluence.
