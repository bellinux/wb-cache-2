50|$|Moulds or dies {{are changed}} at times. This is {{commonly}} due to {{weaknesses in the}} final <b>die-cast</b> <b>product,</b> or to difficulties in production caused by the die. Often, the changes are very minor, even minute, and may occur in places that are not clearly visible at first glance. Especially in cases where e.g. a weakness was detected early in the production run, the numbers of early versions reaching the market are often quite low.|$|E
40|$|In {{the chapter}} Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) {{was applied to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of main processes taking part in the <b>die-cast</b> <b>product</b> manufacturing. Calculations on Equipment Availability, Performance Efficiency and Quality Rate were also made for six processes such as: die casting, clipping, drying, drilling, chamfering, packing. The coefficients level was related to the product quality level, where the correlation coefficient r was applied. Stanisław Borkowsk...|$|E

40|$|High-speed {{injection}} {{die casting}} is an effi cient manufacturing technology for upgrading aluminum <b>die-cast</b> <b>products.</b> However, defi ciencies (such as die damage in early period) due to larger {{load on the}} molding die compared with conventional technology have brought new challenges. In this study, the cause of damage generated in super high-speed injection was investigated by the combination of experimental observation of the dies and CAE simulation (e. g. die emperature analysis, fl ow analysis and thermal stress analysis). The potential countermeasures to solve the above problems were also proposed...|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the Lines Bros group {{collapsed}} into receivership. Wrenn bought itself {{free from the}} Official Receiver and continued to trade as G&R Wrenn Ltd, primarily selling mostly <b>die-cast</b> <b>products</b> from the former 'Hornby Dublo' line. Although they obtained rights and the tooling {{for most of the}} Hornby Dublo models, they did not acquire the Hornby brandname. Lines Bros had obtained this name as a result of buying up Hornby Dublo and used it as part of the name 'Tri-ang Hornby'. The Hornby name was subsequently sold to Rovex Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{original}} business, Alumasc Limited of Burton Latimer, was in {{the manufacture}} of aluminium products. In the 1950s it advertised cast metal beer casks which it claimed were preferred by the brewing industry to wooden casks as being more hygienic, stronger and lower maintenance. In 1960 the firm was taken over by Gold Fields Group. In 1962 it displayed a new type of aluminium beer cask at the Exhibition of Aluminium Goods at the Design Centre in London which was made from pressed sheet aluminium which it claimed was 40% lighter than a die-cast barrel though the company continued to make <b>die-cast</b> <b>products,</b> advertising its expertise in them in the Financial Times in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Lesney {{was founded}} on January 19, 1947 as an {{industrial}} die-casting company by Leslie Smith (March 6, 1918 - May 26, 2005) and Rodney Smith (August 26, 1917 - July 20, 2013). The two men were not related by blood; they had been school friends and served together in the Royal Navy during World War II. Shortly after they founded the company, Rodney Smith introduced to his partner a man named John [...] "Jack" [...] Odell, an engineer he had met in a previous job at D.C.M.T. (another die-casting company). Mr. Odell initially rented a space in the Lesney building {{to make his own}} <b>die-casting</b> <b>products,</b> but he joined the company as a partner in that same year.|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive testing using {{ultrasonic}} measurement {{is used to}} ensure the quality of the <b>die-casting</b> <b>products.</b> The quality of a casting depends on the presence of discontinuities such as porosity and on the final metallurgical structure. Discontinuities occurring in the sub-surface of the cast structure mostly have irregular surfaces which scatter the ultrasound waves and make ultrasonic testing more difficult. The effective use of ultrasonic testing for inspection of castings depends greatly upon the skills and expertise of the operator. However, the initial experimental set-up is important to develop a proper inspection procedure that is easily understood by the operators. The aim of the present work is to investigate and develop an automated ultrasonic inspection system for detecting sub-surface defects in aluminium die-casting parts. Two sample test cases were selected from the industrial partners. Ultrasonic immersion testing was carried out on the sample parts using different probes situated at different water path distances to obtain the best possible signal from the defect. The results obtained from the experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of developing an online automatic inspection system to detect sub-surface defects in aluminium die-casting components...|$|R
40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of <b>die-cast</b> <b>products</b> can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.). Each of these factors also may influence the casting quality and productivity of a die-casting enterprise. In a die-casting enterprise, decisions regarding these issues are made frequently and are based on a large number of factors. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} energy consumption can vary significantly from one die-casting enterprise to the next, and within a single enterprise as function of time...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on the {{importance}} of the project selection process and its role in the successful deployment of Six Sigma within organizations. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the literature is presented, highlighting the importance of project selection in Six Sigma deployment, which is an area of extreme importance that has been less researched in the past. The paper, through a real-life case study, proposes a hybrid methodology, which combines the analytical hierarchy process and the project desirability matrix to select a project for Six Sigma deployment. Findings – The paper demonstrates the efficacy of proposed methodology by its application in a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) manufacturing <b>die-casting</b> <b>product.</b> The example provided is a real-life case study conducted by the authors in an organization embracing the Six Sigma business strategy within their day-to-day functioning. Research limitations/implications – The proposed methodology is tested only in a case study SME, which is the limitation of the paper. The robustness of the methodology can be tested by conducting several case studies in organizations and comparing the results with other existing methodologies for project selection such as project prioritisation matrix or the failure mode and effect analysis. Practical implications – The paper accentuates the importance of the project selection process for Six Sigma deployment, which can have a tremendous effect on the business profitability of an organization. The paper is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers. Originality/value – The paper presents a methodology linking the project selection process to successful deployment of Six Sigma within organizations, an important topic that has been neglected in the past. The paper will enable managers and practitioners to emphasize the importance of project selection and to identify and focus on the critical success factors in successful deployment of Six Sigma projects...|$|R
40|$|Inappropriate {{air vent}} design always induced {{porosities}} in thin and complex shape of high pressure <b>die-casting</b> (HPDC) <b>products.</b> Chill block installation was preferred to improve permanent molds for reducing porosities. There were not regular {{to obtain an}} appropriated chill vent from this method unless an experience of mold makers. This research was performed to investigate and evaluate the chill block performance in the HPDC mold of motorcycle fuel caps. The HPDC mold of the thin and complex shape product without chill vents was improved by inserting of chill blocks. The motorcycle fuel caps of molds with and without chill vents were compared to verify size and position of porosity defects. Furthermore the HPDC simulation using the finite element analysis (FEA) had been performed according to the physical experiment. The FEA results were compared and {{in agreement with the}} experimental data. Therefore an improvement of the HPDC mold should be used FEA to obtain the best way of the air vent design...|$|R
5000|$|The Matchbox name {{originated}} in 1953 as {{a brand name}} of the British <b>die-casting</b> company, Lesney <b>Products,</b> whose reputation would be moulded by John W. [...] "Jack" [...] Odell (1920-2007), Leslie Charles Smith (1918-2005), and Rodney Smith (hence the name Lesney, a portmanteau of Leslie and Rodney Smith's first names). Their first major sales success was the popular model of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation coach, which sold {{more than a million}} models. Shortly thereafter, Lesney co-owner Jack Odell created a toy that effectively {{paved the way for the}} company's future success. It was designed for his daughter: her school only allowed children to bring toys that could fit inside a matchbox, so Odell crafted a scaled-down version of the Lesney green and red road roller. This toy ultimately became the first of the 1-75 miniature range. A dump truck and a cement mixer completed the original three-model release that marked the starting point for the mass-market success of the Matchbox series. As a result of the inspiration for the toys' size, the idea was born to sell the models in replica matchboxes — thus yielding the name of the series. It also resulted in the description of the models' scales being [...] "1:box" [...] (as opposed to more mathematical scales such as 1:87, 1:64, or 1:43).|$|R
