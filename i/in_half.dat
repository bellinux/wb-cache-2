5|$|The unlockable vortigaunt mission {{provides}} {{background information}} explaining how the orange crystals {{used by the}} rift-sealing machine <b>in</b> <b>Half</b> Life: Decay are acquired and used by the Nihilanth during the final boss battle <b>in</b> <b>Half</b> Life. The two player-controlled vortigaunts battle through Marines and Black Ops in the underground Black Mesa complex to find the orange crystals {{in the back of}} a military van. At this point the screen fades and the mission is declared a success; it is presumed that the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Lincolnshire is {{a suburb of}} the city of Chicago in the {{southern}} reaches of Lake County; like Chicago, Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois. The Des Plaines River meanders through {{the eastern part of the}} village, dividing the town <b>in</b> <b>half</b> vertically at the village hall, while Half Day Road (Illinois Route 22) splits the village <b>in</b> <b>half</b> in an east–west direction. Milwaukee Avenue (U.S. Route 45) runs in a north–south direction through Lincolnshire, into the village of Buffalo Grove to the south and Vernon Hills to the north.|$|E

5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, {{and some}} cities were close to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League <b>in</b> <b>half.</b> The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E

5|$|After the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division {{was moved}} to defend the Naktong River line.

The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, promoting a fight there.|$|E
