5000|$|In the United States, the {{labeling}} of garments came into law under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (TFPIA).

[...] <b>Household</b> <b>textile</b> articles include “wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding”. [...] The goal of the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the fiber content of textile fiber products. It wasn’t until 1984 that the TFPIA was amended to include items made in The United States stating that they were “Made in U.S.A”.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Textile product {{labels are}} {{provided}} on the clothing and <b>household</b> <b>textile</b> products to assist consumers with important product information. However, the assumption cannot {{be made that}} because the label is available on these products {{it will be used}} by consumers. Consumers do not base their pre– and post–purchasing decisions on reality but rather on what they perceive to be the reality. Thus consumers’ perceptions of textile product labels need to be studied as it influences their pre– and post–purchasing decisions and use of these labels. Consumers use their perceptions as a frame of reference for making purchasing decisions. This study determined consumers’ perceptions, in order to form a better understanding of their textile pre– and post–purchasing decisions. However, perception is not a singular concept but an interactive process. Therefore, the present study, done in the Gauteng Province, aimed to determine consumers’ perceptions of clothing and <b>household</b> <b>textile</b> labels, by focusing on the perceptual process of consumers. The first objective was to determine consumers’ awareness of labels on clothing and <b>household</b> <b>textile</b> products. Secondly, it was determined whether consumers’ attention is drawn to labels of clothing and <b>household</b> <b>textile</b> products. Thirdly it was determined whether labels on textile products are important to consumers and finally, whether consumers interpret labels on textile products. An interviewer–administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. A total of 411 questionnaires were administered by trained fieldworkers. The study location was three different regions in Gauteng Province, namely: Pretoria, Vereeniging and the West Rand. Public locations were used for the recruitment of respondents selected within the three regions, which included: schools, retirement villages, parking areas and government institutions. This contributed to the probability that a diverse group of respondents participated. The study population consisted of 44. 5 % males and 55. 5 % females. The home languages most spoken among the respondents were English (20. 9 %), Afrikaans (21. 1 %) or isiZulu (16. 5 %). Respondents generally tended to have a positive perception regarding textile product labels. The results illustrated that respondents tended to agree to be aware of label information and that the front and back panels of the label draw their attention. However respondents tended to be neutral as to whether the information is important enough to read. Respondents mostly agreed that they interpret the symbols on textile product labels. Although respondents tended to perceive textile product labels positively, it still remains unclear whether it is important enough for consumers to use these labels found on textile products. By striving to improve consumers’ perceptions regarding textile product labels through better labelling initiatives and consumer education on labels, consumers might view labels as important and use them before and after purchasing a textile product. This will in effect teach consumers how to clean and maintain textile products to extend the product’s lifespan. This would in turn contribute to the consumer’s pre– and post–purchasing satisfaction. This study additionally found that respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels were influenced by some of their demographic characteristics. Although there were no large effect sizes which illustrated practical significance, there were some small to medium tendencies regarding respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels and their demographic characteristics. Different tendencies were especially found when analysing the relationships between respondents’ perceptions and age or language. Older respondents (60 and older) tended to have a more positive perception of textile product labels than younger respondents (18 to 29 years). In addition, respondents with an African language as their home language seemed to differ from Afrikaans and English respondents. To understand South African consumers fully, researchers should understand the diversity and political history of South Africa, by focusing on cultural differences and reasons thereof. Different age generations need to be examined in further South African studies {{in order to determine the}} perceptions of consumers from different age groups regarding textile product labels.

40|$|In October 1852, Amy Fiske (1785 - 1859) of Sturbridge, Massachusetts, {{stitched}} a sampler. But {{she was not}} {{a schoolgirl}} making a sampler to learn her letters. Instead, as she explained: “The above is what I have taken from my sampler that I wrought when I was nine years old. It was w[rough]t on fine cloth it tattered to pieces. My age at this time is 66 years. ” Drawing from 167 examples of decorative needlework – primarily samplers and quilts from 114 collections across the United States – made by individual women aged forty years and over between 1820 and 1860, this dissertation explores how Fiske and women like her experienced social and cultural change in antebellum America, and probes their personal reactions to growing older. ^ Falling at the intersection of women’s history, material culture study and the history of aging, this dissertation brings together objects, diaries, letters, portraits, and prescriptive literature to consider how middle-class American women experienced the aging process. ^ Chapter 1 explores the physical and mental effects of “old age” on antebellum women and their needlework. It considers samplers modified later in life through the removal of the maker’s age or the date when the sampler was made. Chapter 2 examines epistolary needlework, that which relates a message or story in the form of stitched words. Chapter 3 focuses on technological developments related to needlework during the antebellum period, particularly indelible ink {{and the rise of the}} sewing machine, and the tensions that arose from the increased mechanization of textile production. Chapter 4 considers how gift needlework functioned among friends and family members. The materials, style and techniques represented in these gifts often passed along an embedded message, allowing the maker to share her opinions, to demonstrate her skill and creativity, and to leave behind a memorial of her life. ^ Far from being a decorative ornament or a functional <b>household</b> <b>textile,</b> these samplers and quilts served their own ends. They offered aging women a means of coping, of sharing and of expressing themselves. In the end, the study argues that these “threads of time” provide a valuable and revealing source on the lives of mature antebellum women. ...|$|R
2500|$|In many of {{the more}} rural parts of the state, the making of crafts such as textiles, baskets, wood items and more can {{contribute}} significantly to <b>household</b> income. <b>Textile</b> production is widespread, but some of the best embroidery is done in Tenango de Doria, in which blouses, skirts and more are covered in designs of bright colors. Another area with noted embroidery is Acaxochitlán and nearby communities in the Sierra de Huasteca. The designs on these pieces are endemic to the area. In the Mezquital Valley, they make items with maguey fiber, often for rope, belts, bags and sandals. The weaving of cotton and wool into items such as blankets, wraps and other items is also a widespread craft. Fibers from maguey plants and palm trees are also used in the production of baskets, hats and mats. One native hat made from palm fronds is called [...] "garambullero" [...] as well as a type of rattle. Other materials worked into baskets and other items include reeds, willow branches and ixtle.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} human {{population in the}} world, textiles are part of current unsustainable consumption patterns. Unlike most other mass produced products available today however, textiles are often vital to satisfy human core needs, and cannot be considered superfluous. Textile materials can be problematic from an environmental perspective. Synthetics are made from non-renewable petroleum, while production natural textile materials are very resource intensive, and rely on non-renewable energy supplies. Many reports on textiles indicate that production and use have great environmental impacts compared to waste management. On the other hand, {{it is in the}} latter phase decided whether the textile should be reused, recycled or discarded. These different material flow alternatives greatly determine overall impacts, since the possibility of avoided production through reuse and recycling is an important factor to consider. The main goal of this report was, through the use of life cycle assessment (LCA), to evaluate the environmental impact of <b>household</b> <b>textile</b> waste management from reuse and disposal alternatives, when conducted through the activities of the Swedish waste management company SÖRAB. Two different waste management strategies/scenarios where compared: one centered around incineration of textile waste, specified as the incineration scenario, and one focused on a textile waste flow where the textiles are separated from household waste and sorted for reuse, recycling and incineration, specified as the reuse scenario. Due to the potential effects of displaced production through reuse and recycling, it was deemed important to additionally include the textile production phase besides the waste management phase in the LCA. Since the use of the textiles was considered outside of the sphere of influence of SÖRAB, this phase was excluded from the report. Results indicate that the reuse scenario is, in all impact categories investigated, preferable to the incineration scenario. The reason for this is the displaced production in the reuse scenario thanks to the fact that textiles sorted as reuse in the waste management phase are assumed to replace virgin textiles in the use phase. Since the production phase contributes with {{the vast majority of the}} environmental impacts, avoided production affects results greatly, by lowering total impacts. For a company like SÖRAB, the easiest way currently to contribute to lowering environmental impacts would be to inform and in different ways encourage households to increase sorting of textiles for reuse, instead of it being thrown in the household waste...|$|R
