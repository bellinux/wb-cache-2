5000|$|The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants is a {{collection}} of fantasy and horror short stories by British author <b>J.</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Campbell, who dropped the initial from his name in subsequent publications. It was released in 1964 by Arkham House in an edition of 2,009 copies and was the author's first book. The stories are part of the Cthulhu Mythos. Campbell had originally written his introduction {{to be included in the}} book The Dark Brotherhood and Other Pieces under the title [...] "Cthulhu in Britain". However, Arkham's editor, August Derleth, decided to use it here (retitled [...] "A Word from the Author"). The stories utilise such settings as Brichester, Goatswood and Clotton - Campbell's equivalent English invented locales comprising the Severn Valley, based upon H. P. Lovecraft's invention of such locales as Arkham, Dunwich, and Kingsport. The title story introduces Campbell's fictitious book of occult lore, the Revelations of Gla'aki, similar to Lovecraft's Necronomicon.|$|E
