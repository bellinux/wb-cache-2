5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, {{by adding a}} finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, {{but it is not}} certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E
5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> encourage individual drinkers {{to take up}} abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, Malone married Elinor Lucy (née Penn). The couple would {{eventually}} have five children, {{a daughter and}} four sons. As well as supporting his young family he <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{take an active role}} in the Stratford community. He was a member of the Hawera County Council as well as the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. From 1890, in addition to his farming, Malone also worked as a land agent. Later, he helped found the Stratford County Council and served as its first clerk and treasurer from 1891 to 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Coolsma {{published}} a {{revised version of}} his grammar. Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, who had also preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a revised version of his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917. Her death led him to reduce his workload, although he <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> publish his memoirs, Terugblik op mijn levensweg, 1840–1924 (Looking Back on my Life, 1840–1924), in 1924. He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|In {{between these}} works he <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning}} of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{raised the}} younger {{children}} alone after John's death, but <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> assist others in need. Paul's oldest sister, Anne, became a nun {{and went on to}} write hymns, while a younger sister, Mary-Jo, plays piano in Latin bands and teaches music. An older brother, Martin, works for Edmund Rice International, with another brother, Tony, a drug and alcohol counsellor, who ran as an Australian Greens candidate in the 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Josephine Kelly moved to Brisbane, where she died in 2000, at the age of 76.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{continue}} on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with ex-members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, {{decided to focus}} on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying. During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|After Cedar Creek, {{the army}} {{stayed in the}} {{vicinity}} through election day, when McKinley cast his first presidential ballot, for the incumbent Republican, Abraham Lincoln. The next day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was captured by Confederate raiders. Crook's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign, and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days—Crook, John D. Stevenson, Samuel S. Carroll, and Winfield S. Hancock. Finally assigned to Carroll's staff again, McKinley acted as the general's first and only adjutant. Lee and his army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant a few days later, effectively ending the war. McKinley <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> join a Freemason lodge (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia, before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a brevet commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties. Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley {{to apply for a}} place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.|$|E

5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a {{nationwide}} investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield {{carried out the}} fieldwork in Yorkshire. The {{relationship between the two}} bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council. In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary, and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, reformed the Manchester branch, and <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales. The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and Marion Phillips was appointed to succeed her.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{engaged the}} French scholar René-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argencé, then {{teaching}} at the University of California, as full-time curator of his collection and advisor on acquisitions. The two men made a deal—no piece would be purchased unless both men agreed. They built a collection of jade which ranged from the neolithic period to the modern era; and hundreds of Chinese, Japanese and Korean bronzes, mostly Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The painter whom Brundage admired the most was Huizong, 12th-century Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty; the collector never was able to obtain any of his work. Brundage several times bought pieces smuggled out of their lands of origin to restore them there. When Brundage sold a piece, it was most likely because he no longer favored it artistically, rather than to realize a profit. In 1954, a financial statement prepared for Brundage listed {{the value of his}} collection as more than $1million. In 1960, Robert Shaplen, in his article on Brundage for The New Yorker, noted that Brundage, during his travels as IOC president, always <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> visit art dealers, and stated that the collection was valued at $15million.|$|E

5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick also <b>found</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{contribute}} to {{the administration of the}} wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E
