The move initially raised eyebrows with many questioning the usefulness of a complete unknown who is about to turn 29 years of age, however over the coming season, Pantić would prove himself to be the missing piece this team needed with key goals and assists. Another key acquisition was 29-year-old Bulgarian tall centre forward Luboslav Penev, brought in from Valencia despite questions about his health due to a recent bout with testicular cancer. Other <b>incoming</b> <b>transfers</b> included goalkeeper José Francisco Molina and central defender Santi Denia from Albacete, midfielder Roberto Fresnedoso from Espanyol and young Argentine striker Leo Biagini from Newell's Old Boys, who starred at the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship.|$|E

OH Leuven states that they have also obtained a clause to activate a permanent transfer of the 23-year-old Swedish defender. One week later, three more <b>incoming</b> <b>transfers</b> are announced, as OHL brings in two international players, Belgian Marvin Ogunjimi and Bosnian Muhamed Subašić, both on loan respectively from Mallorca and Olimpic Sarajevo, together with a second Brazilian player Douglas Maia, who was a free agent.

Chuka has been with the team for two seasons, scoring many goals, while Mikulić had helped out to strengthen the defence during the last 6 months. Chuka moves to CFR Cluj, while Mikulić moves to Panthrakikos. The stream of transfers is interrupted by the news that wingback Günther Vanaudenaerde has fractured his tibia during the friendly against Heerenveen and will be out for at least three months.

However, the situation did not improve, and after the defeat to Cittadella, Beretta was sacked. In his place, Colantuono was recalled. Meanwhile, Cairo named Gianluca Petrachi, famous for his work at Pisa, the new sporting director at Torino. In a period of two weeks, Petrachi almost re-established the entire team, completing ten outgoing and 12 <b>incoming</b> <b>transfers.</b> The new team amassed 42 points {{in the second half of}} the season. On 26 February 2010, Urbano Cairo announced that he had officially put the club up for sale.

Torino finished in fifth place, qualifying for the playoffs. Here, Torino eliminated Sassuolo in the semi-finals (1-1 at home; 2-1 away) but lost in the final against Brescia (0-0 at home; 2-1 away). The following season, Colantuono moved to Atalanta, with Franco Lerda named his replacement. He was relieved on 9 March 2011 to make way for Giuseppe Papadopulo, but on 20 March, after just 11 days, he was fired. Lerda returned and did not lose until the final day of the season, a 0-2 defeat at home to Padova, thus remaining outside the playoff zone and the second tier for a third consecutive year.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{there are}} {{numerous}} reports from states about constraints placed on <b>incoming</b> <b>transfers</b> because of budget cuts, although the general pattern is that states are working harder to ensure a smoother transition, with transfers of credit, from community colleges to four-year flagship schools.

In 2008 in Florida, the University of Florida announced reductions in its transfer class by 33% to cope with budget shortfalls. The picture is similar in Minnesota, with a report that the University of Minnesota is planning to decrease the number of transfer applicants by 8%, meaning that 300 fewer students {{will be able to}} transfer into the state's flagship college, although there is a conflicting report suggesting that enrollment at the state's university is increasing. At Maryland's Bowie State University, transfer applicants apply online, pay a fee of $40, ask their current college to send official transcripts of their coursework, and require a minimum of 24 transferable credits with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. Bowie considers applicants from two-year colleges differently from applicants elsewhere; two-year applicants can transfer a maximum of 65 credit hours, while applicants from four-year colleges can transfer a maximum of 90 credit hours.
