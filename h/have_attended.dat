40|$|It’s elementary: {{students}} {{benefit from}} pre-primary education.

40|$|Helping {{families}} access affordable, quality {{child care}} {{has been the}} primary focus for the Orange County, North Carolina Smart Start Partnership for Young Children.

5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only five books owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to <b>have</b> <b>attended</b> any papal councils or synods.

Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.

5|$|Hugh may not <b>have</b> <b>attended</b> the {{coronation}} of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at {{the coronation}}, others do not.

In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of York at the coronation of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The coronation of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} {{both black and white}} children to repeat sentences which conform to the grammatical rules of standard versus nonstandard English, and to examine how attendance at racially and socioeconomically integrated versus segregated schools affected performance in standard and nonstandard English, third and fourth graders were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 80 black children from low-income homes. About half of these children <b>had</b> <b>attended</b> an integrated school in a suburban area since their entrance into school. The remaining children <b>had</b> <b>attended</b> an all-black school in their own neighborhood. Groups 3 and 4 consisted of 60 middle-income, mostly white children, who <b>had</b> <b>attended</b> a segregated school in their own neighborhood. Results revealed that black, low-income children performed significantly better than white, middle-class income children in recalling nonstandard sentences. Black, low-income children who <b>had</b> <b>attended</b> an integrated school were both better on standard and poorer on nonstandard sentences than similar children who <b>had</b> <b>attended</b> a segregated school.

5|$|Little {{is known}} of William Bruce's youth, and his date of birth is unrecorded. He was {{probably}} born at Blairhall in western Fife, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. He may <b>have</b> <b>attended</b> St Andrews University in 1637–1638, which would suggest that his birth date was as early as 1625. The Bruces were a well-connected Episcopalian family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from Thomas Bruce a cousin of King Robert II, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife. Bruce's first cousin Edward Bruce was created Earl of Kincardine in 1643.|$|E
