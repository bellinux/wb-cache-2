25|$|Recruits: 5 plus 3 {{nominated}} but not enlisted. A further 12 {{men from}} Toowoomba and other towns {{to the west}} joined up during this weekend, but it is unclear if they accompanied the <b>Dungaree</b> march to Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|The men wore dark <b>dungaree</b> (blue denim-like material) uniforms {{with white}} linen hats and were {{supplied}} with badges indicating their initial acceptance following a medical examination into the recruitment process. This outfit of clothes {{was used as}} fatigues (clothes for non-combat manual work) by Australian soldiers {{since at least the}} Boer War.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dungarees</b> {{were the}} junior enlisted (E1-E6) working uniform worn from 1913 through the 1990s; through World War II <b>dungarees</b> with a {{garrison}} or combination cover were also worn by CPOs engaged in dirty jobs. Unlike later working uniforms, <b>dungarees</b> {{were not allowed}} to be worn outside of military installations; service members were allowed to wear the uniform to and from the installation in a vehicle, but were not authorized to make any stops between while in the <b>dungarees.</b> In fact, until World War II <b>dungarees</b> could only be worn in port in ships' interior spaces, below the main deck or inside gun turrets.|$|R
25|$|During the march, the Cooees {{were issued}} about 50 <b>dungarees</b> in Dubbo, Army greatcoats in Orange and some {{additional}} <b>dungarees</b> in Lithgow.|$|R
25|$|Most of the <b>Dungarees</b> had {{expected}} to serve at Gallipoli, but troops were withdrawn from there by 20 December 1915. Instead the <b>Dungarees</b> were sent to either the Middle East or the Western Front. Most of the <b>Dungarees</b> were recruited into the 11th Reinforcements of the 25th Battalion. Others were given specialist roles in other battalions depending on their qualifications and work experience.|$|R
25|$|Officially {{the exact}} date, ship and {{route of the}} men's {{departure}} overseas were not publicised. However, news was often spread by less official means; for example, <b>Dungaree</b> Sydney Marsh of Silkstone cabled his parents and they forwarded the news to the Queensland Times newspaper. Marsh indicated that the 11th reinforcements of the 25th Battalion had arrived in Egypt on 11 May 1916 and were expecting {{to head to the}} front in France soon.|$|E
500|$|From 1885 to 1894, the Navy {{recognized}} {{three classes}} of Petty Officersfirst, second, and third. These noncommissioned officers were authorized {{to wear a}} [...] "rate" [...] (rank) insignia consisting of chevrons pointing down under a spread eagle and a rating mark. Unlike the current rate badge, the eagle faced right instead of left. The current insignia for Petty Officers came about in 1894, and is a perched eagle with spread wings facing left (usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "crow," [...] due to its black color on white uniforms and the outdated <b>dungaree</b> working uniforms) atop a rating mark, with chevrons denoting their rank below. The Eagle faced left or right on the rating emblem depending on which sleeve the badge was worn. [...] "Seafarer" [...] rates, such as Bos'n or Gunner, are unique to service aboard a ship, and were worn on the right sleeve. The Eagle (or 'crow') on these insignia faced right, so that they would be facing forward on the wearer. Other rates, which were equivalent to shore activities, such as Administration or Medical, were worn on the left sleeve, so the Eagle on those insignia faced left, so that they would be facing forward on the wearer. In 1948, the Navy standardized all ratings to be worn on the left sleeve.|$|E
500|$|Spears was {{credited}} with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the <b>dungaree</b> doll, the angel baby who just {{has to make a}} scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

Afterward, Ahuhu, out of the dozen <b>dungarees</b> you will give me one, else shall I be compelled to walk backward, my own and only <b>dungarees</b> being in like manner well worn and shameful." ...|$|R

2500|$|ROK Navy uniforms {{were based}} on US Navy uniforms with some notable differences. Petty officers, not just [...] "CPO"s, wear uniforms {{identical}} to that of an officer's uniform except with different insignia, and petty officers wear a peaked cap with a white cover and a gold [...] Junior enlisted ratings wear <b>dungaree</b> trousers and chambray shirts as their work uniforms, on the dress uniform they wear sailor caps of the Japanese pattern (with ship or base name in Hangul).|$|E
2500|$|Low {{black leather}} boots called [...] "boondockers" [...] were issued with the <b>dungaree</b> uniform, however, sailors {{were allowed to}} wear black leather jump boots. [...] Flight deck {{personnel}} were issued a type of taller cap-toe boot similar in design to jump boots known colloquially as [...] "wing walkers". These types of boots had zig-zag patterned out-soles to avoid gathering FOD (Foreign Object Debris) between the ridges that could litter the flight deck and cause potential damage to aircraft. [...] "Dealer/Chelsea" [...] style ankle boots (known colloquially as Lox boots) with elastic-sides were issued to personnel working with Liquid oxygen for easier removal in case the boots would freeze upon contact.|$|E

We'll call you old Uncle Ned, because you've got no wool {{on the top of}} your head, just the place where the wool ought to grow. Step to port, Uncle. Don't you hear Mr. Hay has picked you? Then I'll take the white man. White Man, step to starboard. Now, which of you two is the cook? You? Then Mr. Hay takes your friend in the blue <b>dungaree.</b> Step to port, <b>Dungaree,</b> There, we know who we all are: <b>Dungaree,</b> Uncle Ned, Sally Day, White Man, and Cook. All F.F.V.'s I guess. And now, Mr. Hay, we'll up anchor, if you please." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{first the}} captain felt {{the peace and}} content of it {{stealing}} in upon him; then the consciousness of all that he had gone through and was going through smote him, and he was resentful. By what right did this ragged beachcomber, in <b>dungaree</b> trousers and a cotton shirt, suggest {{such a thing as}} peace and content to him and his overwrought, exhausted soul? The captain did not reason this; it was the unconscious process of emotion that caused his resentment.|$|E

6000|$|From his trolley {{he could}} hear the whistle of the serang's silver pipe and the creek and clatter of the pulleys. Peroo was {{standing}} on the top-most coping of the tower, clad in the blue <b>dungaree</b> of his abandoned service, and as Findlayson motioned to him to be careful, for his was no life to throw away, he gripped the last pole, and, shading his eyes ship-fashion, answered with the long-drawn wail of the fo'c'sle lookout: [...] "Ham dekhta hai" [...] ("I am looking out").|$|E
60|$|The bidarka turned {{broadside}} and {{the ripple}} of surf threatened to swamp it, only a naked boy {{ran into the}} water and pulled the bow high up on the sand. The man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers. A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear, clung loosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat. A fisherman's tam-o'-shanter on his close-clipped head, and <b>dungaree</b> trousers and heavy brogans completed his outfit.|$|E

60|$|He was a muscular, {{short man}} with eyes that gleamed and blinked, a harsh voice, and a round, toneless, {{pock-marked}} face ornamented by a thin, dishevelled moustache, sticking out quaintly under {{the tip of}} a rigid nose. Schomberg made the reflection that there was nothing secretarial about him. Both he and his long, lank principal wore the usual white suit of the tropics, cork helmets, pipe-clayed white shoes--all correct. The hairy nondescript creature perched on their luggage in the bow had a check shirt and blue <b>dungaree</b> trousers. He gazed in their direction from forward in an expectant, trained-animal manner.|$|E
60|$|SCENE--The firemen's {{forecastle}} of a {{transatlantic liner}} {{an hour after}} sailing from New York for the voyage across. Tiers of narrow, steel bunks, three deep, on all sides. An entrance in rear. Benches on the floor before the bunks. The room is crowded with men, shouting, cursing, laughing, singing--a confused, inchoate uproar swelling {{into a sort of}} unity, a meaning--the bewildered, furious, baffled defiance of a beast in a cage. Nearly all the men are drunk. Many bottles are passed from hand to hand. All are dressed in <b>dungaree</b> pants, heavy ugly shoes. Some wear singlets, but the majority are stripped to the waist.|$|E
60|$|To see {{him coming}} aft {{to the wheel}} comforted one. The blue <b>dungaree</b> {{trousers}} turned up the calf, one leg a little higher than the other, the clean check shirt, the white canvas cap, evidently made by himself, made up a whole of peculiar smartness, and the persistent jauntiness of his gait, even, poor fellow, when he couldn't help tottering, told of his invincible spirit. There was also a man called Gambril. He was the only grizzled person in the ship. His face was of an austere type. But if I remember all their faces, wasting tragically before my eyes, most of their names have vanished from my memory.|$|E
50|$|Ivy sports two {{pigtails}} on her jet-black {{messy hair}} and a single tooth in her mouth.
