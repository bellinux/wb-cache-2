The advantage of constant power is a smaller electrical motor size and also constant speed for all operation points. Thus the cooling effect remains effective and the noise emission is low. This approach is quite new, because usually the hydraulic design focuses on best efficiency. Different design parameters are systematically investigated, which results in approximately eleven different semi-axial type impellers combined with a new diffuser. All impellers are tested in a special test stand which allows a detailed loss analysis to determine the pump efficiency. The results are displayed and discussed, which help to extract some guidance for design of such pumps...|$|E

Based on the concept, this study is aimed to develop a liquid device that have multifunction, which are transferring liquid substances to other containers manually and can refill the liquid from other source into tank automatically. The LHD has leveling system, using ultrasonic sensor which is used to state the balance of liquid in the tank, and in the refilling process, it helps to control the process where it stops the process automatically when the maximum level is reached. Single-stage DC pump is used to pump in and out liquid substances from the tank. The liquid-crystal display (LCD) informs the users about the balance of the liquid in tank. Indicators are used to trigger display warning about the process running by the device. There are three phases in this project. Phase I is designing system. Phase II covers the programming. The programming is built using Arduino IDE using C language. Phase III is building circuit and hardware, including the piping system. Pump, ultrasonic sensor, LCD, indicators and switches are connected at the Arduino board (microcontroller ATmega 328).

The component models used belong to the ThermoSysPro (Modelica-based) library developed by EDF and released under open source license. The main objective of ThermoSysPro {{is to provide a}} generic library for the modeling and simulation of power plants and other kinds of energy systems. The meaning of the word ‘generic’ is here to be understood as the possibility to use the same components to model different kinds of energy systems (thermal, nuclear, solar, etc.) for different types of studies (design, control system verification, etc.).

The selected technology must provide micro-gravity gasfliquid separation and pump the liquid from 10 psia at the gasfliquid interface to 18 psia at the wastewater bus storage tank. The rotary disk concept, which has pedigree in other systems currently being built for installation on the ISS, failed to achieve the required pumping head within the allotted power. The separator discussed in this paper is a new design that was tested to determine compliance with performance requirements in the CRA. The <b>drum</b> separator and <b>pump</b> @SP) design is similar to the Oxygen Generator Assembly (OGA) Rotary Separator Accumulator (RSA) in that it has a rotating assembly inside a stationary housing driven by a integral internal motor. The innovation of the DSP is the drum shaped rotating assembly that acts as the accumulator and also pumps the liquid at much less power than its predecessors. In the CRA application, the separator will rotate at slow speed while accumulating water. Once full, the separator will increase speed to generate sufficient head to pump the water to the wastewater bus.

40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as impeller wearing rings, inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} balance <b>drums</b> in centrifugal <b>pumps,</b> or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating oils, and clearances are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by internal clearances of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the clearance space into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the clearance space itself become dominant. Both types of clearance space alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the internal clearances both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|R

A 0 D steady state model of the MiraFiori heat and power plant was built in order to check, validate and improve the energy performances of the plant. A multi configurations steady state model of a combined heat and power biomass plant was built, the plant satisfies the steam demand during all the year and produces electricity with its remaining energy. Models were built by connecting the component models in a technological way, so that its topology reflects the process flow diagram of the plant. A preliminary calibration of the Mirafiori model was made based on measurement data obtained from on-site sensors and using inverse calculations. The best steam cycle configuration for the Biomass CHP plant was chosen computing various normal conditions points. The models were then able to compute precisely the distribution of the steam/water mass flow rates, pressure and temperature across the network, the exchangers thermal power, and the performance parameters of all the equipments.

40|$|The latest {{literature}} on quality {{management in the}} construction industry asserts that ISO 9000, a standard established in 1987 and drastically upgraded in 2000, has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management’s insistence on “punch-list inspection” creates barriers to adopting Total Quality Management (TQM), a model that fosters a culture of constant improvement. This research project studies the efficacy of quality as a catalyst to eliminate wasted construction process resources caused by ineffective inter-organizational supply-chain. The literature review showed that process planning and simulation in constructions still builds on the reactive Input-Process-Output (IPO) model found unfit to model the proactive management of supply-chain based quality (SCQ). The need for a feed-forward control approach required the introduction of process resource (Input) quality and causality functions predicting the quality of the output. Thus, the developed model, affirming the importance of feed-forward over feed-back control, was built on measuring quality as a function of process waste generation along the construction supply-chain. Referred to as Supply-Chain Dynamic Quality Control (SC-DQC), it extends the output oriented process model to pursue a continuous improvement of the agile construction operations. A construction site at Kensington, NSW was selected, to test the model while evaluating improvements and barriers to its implementation in the real world of construction. After extensive field observations and discussions with the contractors, two universal material supplies were selected for experimental studies: 1) Concrete Placement and 2) Rebar Installation. Both test cases exhibited poor supply chain quality and information sharing, albeit with different consequences. In a first phase, feed-forward control technologies and methods were designed and field-tested to prove the hypotheses predicting technical feasibilities and measurable improvements. Ruggedized Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) to the flowing concrete as five trucks emptied their <b>drums</b> into a <b>pump</b> hopper after laboratory pre-tests. A RFID reader not only detected fourteen out of the fifteen embedded tags, but a tag’s readability increased with the decreasing water-content indicating the curing of the concrete. While RFID tags attached to rebar bundles opened up new information channels along the supply chain, the significant improvements resulted from feed-forwarding ‘process intelligence’ into the rebar fabrication shop ensuring a high quality delivery process. The comparative field experiments proved the drastic effect of DQC on the work efficiency of placing rebar for the test beams. The high supply quality ensured by the Master Bundle (MSB) concept allowed the steel fixers to increase their productive time from 31 % to 77. 4 %. As expected, this radical change was accompanied by a drastic reduction of process waste from 41. 5 % to 6. 2 % and contributory work from 19. 7 % to 10. 5 %. The relevance of the presented research lies in complying scientific evidence that the DQC model, built on a proactive and holistic management philosophy, targets the elimination of process wastes caused by poor quality supply processes. The realization of the substantial improvements will rest on the industry’s ability to adopt mutually supportive relationships and agile communication across the supply chain...|$|R
