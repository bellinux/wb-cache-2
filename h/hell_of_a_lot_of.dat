The president of Darkside Game Studios, Hugh Falk, responded by calling Davis' opinion [...] "outlying". He added that Darkside participated in the project {{towards the end of}} the game's development cycle and that they had to revamp the entire multiplayer system within tight deadlines. Davis later claimed that his comments were not directed at Darkside Game Studios, and that he is satisfied with their final product after a long and troubled development cycle.|$|E

Edge were underwhelmed with the game's opening because of its [...] "skittish" [...] parkour, but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle, the game became very fun. They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge, and called the main missions [...] "for the most part well designed and generously proportioned". IGN's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin's powers in combat, and called each set [...] "strong enough to hang an entire game on". He found upgrading Delsin's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good replay value. Philip Kollar of Polygon favored using neon power, but praised the balance and variety between all of them. He called the combat [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun".

Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four.

500|$|By March, {{they had}} {{finished}} recording the track, but {{felt that it}} was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn't read music …" [...] According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. When it came to recording his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir were also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.|$|E

He scored twice against Northwich in the FA Trophy first round as York progressed with a 2–0 away victory, Foyle rating Brodie's first as the [...] "goal of the season". Foyle also stated his desire for Brodie to stay at York, after continued reports of interest from Barrow.

He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it".

Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer.

2500|$|In 1907, Captain Johnson {{was still}} in charge of Mount Royal. On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, [...] he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her crosswise against the current. Luckily, she held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided {{that the best way}} to deal with this problem was to use the capstan to winch the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and rammed through the bottom of Mount Royal and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was Mount Royals chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt. After George Little chopped him out, Little commented that there must have been some air down there. The exhausted engineer replied, [...] "I don’t know about air, but there was one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> water!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{crossover}} as a whole, Oliver Sava at The A.V.

There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future." [...] Ed Gross for Empire stated, [...] ""Invasion" [...] is the proverbial mixed bag. As a crossover, it does an extremely effective job in bringing the characters from four different shows together, the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny... The real problem with [...] "Invasion" [...] is that it was intended to be, and was promoted as, a massive adventure, but in reality the whole Dominators storyline was rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative – {{it would have been better}} to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected." [...] Despite some of the criticism, Gross gave the crossover 4 stars out of 5. Collider.com's Allison Keene said, [...] "On the positive side, the interactions among cast members of the four shows – Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow – were as delightful as ever. Though Arrow is often the anchor, The Flash usually sets the tone for the crossovers, and so the other shows incorporate its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing... But on the negative side, the crossovers can also starkly highlight each show's weaknesses," [...] concluding, [...] "There are things [...] "Invasion!" [...] as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans".|$|E
