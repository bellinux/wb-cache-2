25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as <b>if</b> <b>by</b> <b>magic,</b> as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E

2500|$|Ramseur's {{attack was}} a costly repulse, but the Southern {{soldiers}}' heroism earned the admiration of the Union soldiers who witnessed it. The {{historian of the}} 13th Pennsylvania Reserves recorded the event: [...] "The slaughter was so sickening that Major Hartshorne leaped {{to his feet and}} called upon his assailants to surrender. Some hundreds did so. Rebels or no rebels, their behavior and bearing during the charge had won the admiration of their captors, who did not hesitate to express it." [...] A surviving Virginian recalled, [...] "Our line melted away as <b>if</b> <b>by</b> <b>magic.</b> Every brigade, staff and field officer was cut down, (mostly killed outright) in an incredibly short time." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{considered}} one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. [...] According to Ernst Gombrich [...] "in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as <b>if</b> <b>by</b> <b>magic...</b> For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term". [...] The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. [...] Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.|$|E

We enjoyed {{many of the same}} things. One of my strongest memories is her love of art and how she subtly and patiently conveyed it to me. Beautiful objects came alive in her hands, as if her appreciation provided them with special aura of beauty.

60|$|Mr. Bulstrode's usual paleness {{had in fact}} {{taken an}} almost deathly hue.

5000|$|Despite {{the later}} {{reports about the}} early {{invention}} and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known {{and in some cases}} confusion with the Diorama or similar media is possible. In 1826 Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he referred to as [...] "Beautiful Dissolvent Scenes", [...] "imperceptibly changing views", [...] "dissolvent views" [...] and [...] "Magic Views" [...] which were created [...] "by Machinery invented by M. Henry". In 1827 Henry Langdon Childe presented [...] "Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade" [...] with a series of subjects that would become classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827 De Philipsthal returned with a show that included [...] "various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as <b>if</b> it were <b>by</b> <b>Magic)</b> from one form into another".|$|R

40|$|The HKU "Knowledge Exchange" {{initiative}} {{has launched}} many separate projects that {{aim to make}} HKU researchers and their research highly visible. One of these projects {{is the creation of}} HKU ResearcherPages in HKU's institutional repository, that highlight the research and achievements of each professoriate staff at HKU, including their authored publications which are freely available in open access. These pages show download counts of these publications, and paper and citations metrics from Scopus and Thomson Reuter's ResearcherID These pages also allow the HKU author to manage, control, and take charge of how his or her digital presence, or reputation, is shown to the world. Newly aware of their digital presence, HKU authors now have the incentive and tools to correct errors, add missing publications, and otherwise burnish their reputation as shown in these HKU ResearcherPages, Scopus, and ResearcherID.

[...] Almost before she understood it, Muriel was surrounded by an eager and friendly crowd, still afraid to draw near, but evidently anxious to see and to comfort and console her. Many of the women eagerly held forward their native mats, which Mali took from them, and, pressing them for a second against Muriel's eyes, handed them back with just a suspicion of wet tears left glistening in the corner. The happy recipients leaped and shouted with joy. [...] "No more drought!" [...] they cried merrily, with loud shouts and gesticulations.

You could not say that you saw them jump out of their holes.

60|$|The {{trees in}} our orchard and {{elsewhere}} are as yet naked, but already appear {{full of life}} and vegetable blood. It seems as <b>if</b> <b>by</b> one <b>magic</b> touch they might instantaneously burst into full foliage, and that the wind which now sighs through their naked branches might make sudden music amid innumerable leaves. The mossgrown willow-tree which for forty years past has overshadowed these western windows {{will be among the}} first to put on its green attire. There are some objections to the willow; it is not a dry and cleanly tree, and impresses the beholder with an association of sliminess. No trees, I think, are perfectly agreeable as companions unless they have glossy leaves, dry bark, and a firm and hard texture of trunk and branches. But the willow is almost the earliest to gladden us with the promise and reality of beauty in its graceful and delicate foliage, and the last to scatter its yellow yet scarcely withered leaves upon the ground. All through the winter, too, its yellow twigs give it a sunny aspect, which is not without a cheering influence even in the grayest and gloomiest day. Beneath a clouded sky it faithfully remembers the sunshine. Our old house would lose a charm were the willow to be cut down, with its golden crown over the snow-covered roof and its heap of summer verdure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect was}} {{reportedly}} invented by phantasmagoria pioneer Paul de Philipsthal while in Ireland, possibly in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns {{to make the}} spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the Witch of Endor. While working out the desired effect, he got {{the idea of using}} the technique with landscapes. Information about De Philipsthal's activities after 1804 is limited, so it remains unclear whether he did incorporate the effect in his shows before other lanternists developed their own versions. Surviving playbills of his shows seem to focus on the exhibition of automata, besides [...] "experiments in optics, aeronautics, hydraulics and pyrotechnics". Some bills do not even mention any optical effects. However, a 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented [...] "a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect". After a few other lanternists had presented similar shows, De Philipsthal returned from retirement in December 1827 with a show that included [...] "various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as <b>if</b> it were <b>by</b> <b>Magic)</b> from one form into another".|$|R
60|$|The {{pastures}} and grass-fields {{have not yet}} a general effect of green; nor have they that cheerless brown tint which they wear in later autumn, when vegetation has entirely ceased. There is now a suspicion of verdure,-- the faint shadow of it,--but not the warm reality. Sometimes, in a happy exposure,--there is one such tract across the river, the carefully cultivated mowing-field, {{in front of an}} old red homestead,--such patches of land wear a beautiful and tender green, which no other season will equal; because, let the grass be green as it may hereafter, it will not be so set off by surrounding barrenness. The trees in our orchard, and elsewhere, have as yet no leaves; yet to the most careless eye they appear full of life and vegetable blood. It seems as <b>if,</b> <b>by</b> one <b>magic</b> touch, they might instantaneously put forth all their foliage, and the wind, which now sighs through their naked branches, might all at once find itself impeded by innumerable leaves. This sudden development would be scarcely more wonderful than the gleam of verdure which often brightens, in a moment, as it were, along the slope of a bank or roadside. It is like a gleam of sunlight. Just now it was brown, {{like the rest of the}} scenery: look again, and there is an apparition of green grass. The Spring, no doubt, comes onward with fleeter footsteps, because Winter has lingered so long that, at best, she can hardly retrieve half the allotted term of her reign.|$|R
