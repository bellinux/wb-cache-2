5|$|After {{the death}} of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was {{translated}} to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V. Pope Martin <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> to Robert de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, {{in order to take}} Lichton's oath to the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese, a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{formally}} {{advises the}} sovereign on {{the exercise of}} the Royal Prerogative, and corporately (as Queen-in-Council) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council, which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament. The Council also holds the <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> to issue Orders of Council, mostly used to regulate certain public institutions. The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of Royal Charters, which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies, and city or borough status to local authorities. Otherwise, the Privy Council's powers have now been largely replaced by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The College of Arms, {{also known}} as the College of Heralds, is a royal {{corporation}} consisting of professional officers of arms, with jurisdiction over England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some Commonwealth realms. The heralds are appointed by the British Sovereign and are <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> to act on behalf of the Crown in all matters of heraldry, the granting of new coats of arms, genealogical research and the recording of pedigrees. The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land, and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols. Though a part of the Royal Household of the United Kingdom the College is self-financed, unsupported by any public funds.|$|E
5|$|Walter held a legateship from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, {{which enabled}} him to act with the pope's <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> within the English Church. Walter {{actively}} investigated ecclesiastical misconduct, and deposed several abbots, including Robert of Thorney Abbey in 1195 and an abbot of St Mary's {{in the province of}} the Archbishop of York. At the monastic cathedral of Worcester, he disciplined the monks between the death of Henry de Sully and the election of John of Coutances, as was his right as the archbishop of the province. In his own diocese, he granted markets and fairs to towns, was granted the privilege of minting coins at Shrewsbury, and worked to recover lands and manors that had been lost to the archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened {{immediately}} after Alexander's death in Babylon, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. When Perdiccas invaded Egypt {{in the summer of}} 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus. The council appointed Antipater as regent over the two kings, after which Antipater <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> to the leading generals. However, before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as the regent to succeed him, passing over his own son Cassander, ignoring the right of the king to choose a regent (since Philip III was considered mentally unstable), and bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a principal’s decision {{of whether to}} delegate au-thority to an informed agent or only seek the agent’s advice, within an environment of time inconsistent preferences.

The first main finding of the paper is that the principal can do equally well with a strategic choice of expert, from which she solicits advice in-stead of <b>delegating</b> <b>authority,</b> as long as the time inconsistency problem is not too severe. The second main finding is that the principal may strictly prefer seeking advice to <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> if there is prior uncertainty with respect to the preference distance between the principal and th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results from a {{laboratory}} experiment investigating a manager's decision {{whether or not to}} <b>delegate</b> <b>authority</b> to a better informed worker whose interests are often, but not always, congruent. Keeping authority implies a loss of information, as the worker communicates his information strategically. <b>Delegating</b> <b>authority</b> leads to a loss of control. A key aspect of our design is that the manager can restrict the worker's choice set when <b>delegating</b> <b>authority.</b> We find that, in case of delegation, managers (as predicted) put tighter restrictions when interests are less aligned. Workers send more informative messages under communication than predicted by the pure strategy equilibria. This finding neither appears to be driven by lying aversion of workers nor by credulity of managers. Qualitatively, our results are in line with a mixed strategy equilibrium under communication, which strictly outperforms optimal restricted delegation and is relatively close to the optimal stochastic mechanism in our setting...|$|R
40|$|<b>Delegating</b> <b>authority</b> to {{international}} organizations (IOs) {{has recently been}} attacked by observers {{on the right and}} left. Conservatives, especially in the United States, charge that <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> to a supranational body or agency violates the Constitution. Certain powers, it is maintained, cannot be transferred to other parties. Even <b>delegating</b> partial <b>authorities</b> to IOs can lead to a lack of accountability and, ultimately, the decline of constitutional order. 1 Conversely, some progressives claim that <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> to a supranational body creates a democratic deficit and, in the limit, undermines the sovereign state that remains the most promising arena for liberal politics. 2 At the extremes, right and left are joined in the claim that sovereignty is necessary for an authentic and accountable sphere of political action. Granting greater authority to IOs is anathema to both extremes, even while it is cautiously supported by moderates and is, indeed, slowly emerging “on the ground ” in real ways. 3 In this essay, I do not attempt to rebut the various positions on the value of this evolving trend.

25|$|In modern times, various {{officials}} with notable <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> have {{been referred to}} as proconsuls. Studies of leadership typically divide leaders into policymakers and subordinate administrators. The proconsul occupies a position between these two categories. Max Weber classified leadership as traditional, rational-legal (bureaucratic), and charismatic. A proconsul could be both a rule-following bureaucrat and charismatic personality. The rise of bureaucracy and rapid communication has reduced the scope for proconsular freelancing.|$|E

25|$|The typical role of {{a bishop}} is to provide {{pastoral}} governance for a diocese.

These bishops may be known as hierarchs in the Eastern Catholic Churches.

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of New Amsterdam, unlike most other colonies in the New World, were thoroughly documented in city maps. During {{the time of}} New Netherland's colonization, the Dutch were the pre-eminent cartographers in Europe. The <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> of the Dutch West India Company over New Netherland required maintaining sovereignty {{on behalf of the}} States General, generating cash flow through commercial enterprise for its shareholders, and funding the province's growth. Thus its directors regularly required that censuses be taken. These tools to measure and monitor the province's progress were accompanied by accurate maps and plans. These surveys, as well as grassroots activities to seek redress of grievances, account for the existence {{of some of the most}} important of the early documents.|$|E
25|$|From 1635, the vestries and {{the clergy}} were loosely under the diocesan {{authority}} of the Bishop of London. During the English Civil War, the episcopate was under attack, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, was beheaded in 1645. Thus, {{the formation of a}} North American diocesan structure was hampered and hindered. In 1660, the clergy of Virginia petitioned for a bishop to be appointed to the colony; the proposal was vigorously opposed by powerful vestrymen, wealthy planters, who foresaw their interests being curtailed. Subsequent proposals from successive Bishops of London for the appointment of a resident suffragan bishop, or another form of office with <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> to perform episcopal functions, met with equally robust local opposition. No bishop was ever appointed.|$|E

50|$|The public {{counterparts}} (<b>delegating</b> <b>authorities)</b> of {{the concessions}} in Morocco are the municipalities. Each <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> {{has set up}} a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the concessionnaire. The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private concessionnaire. On the other hand, the concessionnaire felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.|$|R
