5000|$|There {{has been}} a {{resurgence}} {{for the importance of}} <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> ratio. The amount of money paid out to executives has steadily been on the rise. [...] "An April 2013 study by Bloomberg finds that large public company CEOs were paid an average of 204 times the compensation of rank-and-file workers in their industries. By comparison, it is estimated that the average CEO was paid about 20 times the typical worker’s pay in the 1950s, with that multiple rising to 42-to-1 in 1980, and to 120-to-1 in 2000". While not as extreme, similar trends have been observed around the world.|$|E

Items describing various job characteristics reflecting the factors of Skill, Effort, Responsibility, Working Conditions, and Organizational characteristics were rated by 510 subjects from a variety of organizations. Results indicated that the items did not cluster into the five categories noted above. Instead, three factors were identified and labeled Job Complexity, Accountability, and Work Context. There were few gender or occupational differences in the ratings of the items. The implications of the results for the development of <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> and salary systems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Job {{evaluation}} {{has become}} one of the most systematic and rational paths for an organization‟s fair and <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> and salary determination. It has become a reality within an organization‟s wage and salary administration. This article tries to investigate the inside concepts, dimensions, premises, and process of job evaluation. It extends to include the universality of job evaluation as a common phenomenon in organizations, particularly large ones. In view of this, this article explores and discusses the variety of ways in which job evaluation is viewed and defined. It also provides a sound understanding of the theoretical / philosophical context of job evaluation. In so doing, the article examines the combination of the conceptual and technical aspects involved in the job evaluation process, which demand good management sense and skill...|$|E

It has also led to broad employment for women at more <b>equitable</b> <b>wages,</b> and access to university education.|$|R

This distinguishes them from [...] "socially responsible businesses", which create positive social change indirectly through the practice of corporate social responsibility (e.g., creating and implementing a philanthropic foundation; paying <b>equitable</b> <b>wages</b> to their employees; using environmentally friendly raw materials; providing volunteers to help with community projects).|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} against the tax brought Gunasinha into contact with Ceylonese workers. He found that the workers were poorly paid, with wages averaging between 30 cts. to Rs. 1.00 for a day's work, sometimes as long as twelve hours. He was determined to get the working class better and more <b>equitable</b> <b>wages.</b> As a result, members {{of the working class}} looked to Gunasinha as the leader they had longed for.|$|R
40|$|Equity {{and income}} {{security}} were {{the cornerstones of}} the socialist system. These objectives were achieved through an <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> structure, guaranteed employment, and wide-ranging subsidies on basic consumer goods and enterprise-provided services. Explicit social protection programs were essentially limited to public pension systems that provided generous benefits to the retired and social assistance programs that helped those with special needs, such as the disabled and orphans. Extensive privileges were also available to particular groups {{as a reward for}} their contribution to society (for example, veterans and teachers) or because of the hardship or danger imposed by their occupation (for example, miners). With the transition to market, the guaranteed employment, retirement security, and consumer subsidies promised by the socialist system diminished substantially {{at the same time that}} the real incomes of households fell. By and large, Central and Eastern European countries used cash assistanc...|$|E
40|$|Organizations, {{especially}} business organizations conduct {{job evaluation}} and analysis {{to establish and}} qualify differences in employee contribution across jobs. These differences provide a foundation for employee compensation decisions. In each case, evaluation is done to the job, not the employee who performs the job, and is influenced by what the business believes it has to pay to attract, retain and motivate people and this in turn will be influenced by market rates and increases {{in the cost of}} living. The purpose of the research was to examine the effect of management style on job evaluation in public corporations with reference to Jomo Kenyatta Foundation. The study adopted descriptive research design taking on a case study where data was collected from a population of Jomo Kenyatta Foundation management staff and other employees who were sampled through stratified random sampling technique. Primary data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire, while secondary data review was obtained from existing literature such as; journals and periodicals, books and internet sources in regard to human resource management. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics where findings were presented in tables and pie charts with interpretation done using frequencies, percentages mean scores and standard deviation. The study found out that participative or democratic, transformational management styles are popularly being used in JKF and that management styles influence job evaluation at Jomo Kenyatta Foundation to a very great extent. The study recommends that JKF management should find a method of determining <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> rate differentials guided by proper job evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The Equal Pay Act had a {{distinct}} market purpose. Congress made a policy choice to modify the existing compensation market so that employees who perform jobs requiring substantially “equal skill, effort, and responsibility” earn equal wages, regardless of sex. The Act aimed not simply to promote individual fairness, but to foster a more efficient, <b>equitable</b> <b>wage</b> market on a systemic level. Congress recognized that paying lower wages to women constituted “an unfair method of competition,” burdened “commerce and {{the free flow of}} goods in commerce,” and prevented the “maximum utilization of available labor resources. ” Over time, however, the “market” in equal pay cases has been transformed from the fundamental reason for the Act to an acceptable business defense for paying women less. At the same time, pay discrimination is conceptualized today in the rhetoric of “fairness,” which overshadows the core market purpose of the Act. This Article contends that equal pay laws have failed in their market purpose and will continue to fail so long as reform is centered solely on a litigation-enforcement model. The Article reframes pay discrimination as a market failure caused by insufficient and asymmetric information about the value of work, rather than an individual fairness concern. It explores lessons that can be learned from executive compensation scholarship, which offers more sophisticated analyses of the causes of abusive pay practices. Executive pay scholars have exposed: (1) the human dynamics and conditions that cause compensation markets to fail; (2) the ineffectiveness of litigation to fully address abusive pay because of court reluctance to interfere with “business judgments” about compensation; and (3) the crucial role of transparency as a market-based approach to reform abusive pay practices. Applying these lessons in modified form, the Article examines how pay secrecy distorts compensation markets and permits pay discrimination to flourish, {{even in the absence of}} intentional sex discrimination. Given the increasing ineffectiveness of equal pay litigation, it analyzes how pay disclosure and transparency can be used to promote a more efficient compensation market in which employees are appropriately valued and rewarded without the taint of discriminatory factors...|$|E

In 1979, the collective organized the first Take Back the Night March, and saw hundreds of women and men rally against staying home as being a solution to unsafe street violence and rape.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature search}} was conducted which illustrated {{the dearth of}} {{research in the area of}} standardized addictions counselor competency development. There is a lack of standardized competency development systems which degrades the comparative validity between substance use disorder counseling and similar fields. Issues in the area of workforce recruitment, retention, and <b>equitable</b> <b>wages</b> can be tied to the absence of unified educational standards. Current counselor development systems cannot guarantee consistency in competence and qualifications. It has become a public health concern as consumers of services are interfacing with practitioners whose education originates from laissez faire counselor development systems.

40|$|As {{conscientious}} shoppers, {{the fair}} trade label {{we see on}} the coffee we drink from Starbucks and the bananas we buy at the natural food market often assure us of our ethical consumer choices. We should, however, question the accuracy of this marketing {{to find out where}} the products we buy actually come from. Are these goods truly traded fairly? Do these products provide <b>equitable</b> <b>wages</b> to farmers and their families in the Southern Hemisphere? This paper will inspect {{the current state of the}} fair trade industry as well as offer suggestions for improvement. The positive outcomes of true fair trade are discussed and the role of the Fair Trade Labeling Organization, or FLO, is examined. Additionally, the supposedly eliminated “middleman” is studied to reveal the flaws of the system. Lastly, various perspectives on fair trade are surveyed to develop a broader understanding of how fair trade functions. If properly implemented, fair trade has the ability to significantly reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in the developing world. In closing, suggestions are offered to redesign the fair trade system in order for the purported benefits of equitable trade to become reality...|$|R
40|$|Feminists have {{achieved}} {{much in the}} Western world. They have drawn attention to issues neglected by male researchers and theorists. They have fought for women's suffrage and reproductive rights, challenged employment discrimination, promoted <b>equitable</b> <b>wages</b> and affirmative action initiatives, and sought rights to property ownership and university education. There is no denying the success of many women and the changing attitudes towards women in society, but there are huge pockets where this middle-class ideal does not pertain, where women are still oppressed and unequal because of their gender, class, sexuality, race, and disability, particularly in the developing contexts {{of the world and}} in marginalized communities in Western countries. Women world-wide are oppressed, marginalized, abused, and disadvantaged because of their gender. If we are to offset anti-feminist movements, we must keep social work critique, scholarship, and activism alive. While cognisant of the need for a unified feminist project, across generations and aspirations, we argue that postcolonial feminism best reflects the challenges faced by social workers in their daily practice, has the most realistic grasp of the 'work to be done' and, hence, is ideally suited to social work practice.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the crowding out effects of corruption and its destabilizing implications on the economic growth of Nigeria, using parsimonious error correction mechanism. The study employed experimental research design approach for the data analysis, which combined theoretical consideration (a priori criteria) with empirical observations and extracted maximum information from the available data. The Nigerian secondary and time series data were tested for stationary and co integration variables before they were used. The results of the regression showed {{that there is a}} negative relationship between corruption and output growth in Nigeria. These findings have some policy implications. The government should introduce a national reorientation program to educate people on the crucial need to eradicate corruption in all sectors of Nigeria’s economic and socio-political systems and strengthen the previous efforts in programs like Code of Conduct Bureau, WAI Brigade, ICPC, EFCC and NATPIP. The government must introduce an <b>equitable</b> <b>wages</b> and incentive system and improve other conditions of work so that the level of poverty could be reduced and the quality of life improved. This will inevitably reduce people’s vulnerability and susceptibility to corruption. She must also introduce transparency devices that can detect and prevent corruption in all areas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Human {{resource}} {{is one of}} the fundamental factors influencing the development of a nation. The socio-economic and political position of a nation is very much dependent on how it recruits, motivates and retains its workforce? In present scenario it is very essential to keep in mind the importance of Quality of Work Life for employees while drafting the various national schemes which intend to provide quality of life to people. This is because QWL {{is an integral part of}} quality of life. The present study aims at identifying the various constructs of QWL responsible in affecting the QWL of employees particularly in the case of women workers in rural area. The constructs of QWL discussed in the present study include safe work environment, <b>equitable</b> <b>wages,</b> equal employment opportunities and opportunities for advancement. (Mirvis and Lawler, 1984). The whole study has been framed from the perspective of women workers employed under MGNREGA. Further, the study attempts to find out how far they have been taken into consideration by the policy drafters of MGNREGA particularly for women employees and suggests the measures for improving QWL among MGNREGA employees particularly in the case of women. The study concludes that the important constructs of QWL have been taken into consideration while drafting MGNREGA but there is still much that must be done to strengthen womens‟ situation in rural areas. The suggestions for the same have been enumerated and the implications of the study discussed...|$|R
40|$|We analyze how {{inequity}} aversion as {{formulated by}} Fehr and Schmidt (1999) interacts with risk aversion {{in an otherwise}} standard moral hazard model with two agents. We find that behindness aversion among agents unambiguously increases agency costs of providing incentives. This holds true if agents also suffer from being better off unless they account for effort costs in their comparisons. Increased agency costs can undermine efficiency in two ways. First, inequity aversion may render <b>equitable</b> flat <b>wage</b> contracts optimal even though incentive contracts are optimal with selfish agents. Second, to avoid social comparisons the principal may employ one agent only, thereby forgoing the efficient effort provision of the second agent. The implications for the nature and boundary of the firm are discussed...|$|R

Using sample data from the 1991 Brazilian census, I estimated monthly wages for a white, brown and black women and men working in the states of S"o Paulo and Bahia. The findings suggest that while women and Afro-Brazilians in Brazil's most developed region of S"o Paulo had the advantages of higher levels of state sponsored work benefits and more <b>equitable</b> occupational and <b>wage</b> distribution, they nevertheless experienced the greatest discrimination. In contrast, the less developed state of Bahia where racial and gender gaps in education, occupation and wages were the most severe, wage discrimination was lowest.

50|$|A {{critique}} of the ideas behind inclusive capitalism begins where Hammond and Prahalad end: “Blocs of poor consumers increasingly {{have the power to}} reject what a multinational corporation wants to buy or sell; via their governments, they can also empower a non-traditional competitor” (Hammond and Prahalad 2004:37). Inclusive capitalism as used by Hammond and Prahalad divorces political power from economic empowerment. It is not concerned with improving poor people’s political condition, allowing those in poverty to have greater political control and representation in government. It does not endorse macroeconomic changes through government policies that ensure higher <b>wages,</b> <b>equitable</b> access to housing, education, nutrition and health care across socioeconomic classes, particularly for poor people. Inclusive capitalism maintains political accountability in contributing to poverty is limited to not doing enough to encourage private enterprise (1) to create more jobs for low-income people; (2) to allow poor people access to financial capital for entrepreneurialism, (3) to enable poor people the opportunity to purchase a variety of goods and services. No consideration is given to governments and companies that benefit from having low-income and poorly educated populations who provide necessary labor.|$|R
