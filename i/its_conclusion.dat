5|$|Pericles {{wanted to}} {{stabilize}} Athens' dominance over its alliance and {{to enforce its}} pre-eminence in Greece. The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to <b>its</b> <b>conclusion</b> by Pericles.|$|E

5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after <b>its</b> <b>conclusion.</b> Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached <b>its</b> <b>conclusion,</b> some tentative plans {{had been made}} for a proposed 27th season {{under the assumption that}} it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories.

5|$|In October 2013, {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the previous season of the show, executive producer Al Jean revealed that a character would die in this episode. In July 2014, on the announcement of the title of the episode, several media outlets incorrectly presumed that Krusty would die. The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti-climactic due to Rabbi Krustofski's minor role in the show, although other reviewers praised <b>its</b> <b>conclusion</b> to the relationship between Krusty and his father.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{animation}} studio Group TAC produced Twin Spicas anime adaptation, {{which was}} broadcast by NHK. The 20-episode series premiered on November 1, 2003, and aired until <b>its</b> <b>conclusion</b> on March 27, 2004. Tomomi Mochizuki directed the anime series, and Rika Nakase wrote its screenplay. Masako Goto designed the characters for animation. When the series reached <b>its</b> <b>conclusion,</b> only 30 {{chapters of the}} manga had been published. Chapter 25, which concludes the story of Asumi and her classmates undergoing a test of their survival skills, was the final chapter to be adapted for the anime. Consequently, the series concludes prematurely with Asumi's ghost companion Lion-san leaving when he no longer has anything to teach her and her friends. The manga, however, continues with Lion-san appearing in subsequent chapters until his eventual departure in chapter 88. The anime series also aired {{in other parts of}} Asia on Animax. It was released in VHS and DVD formats by King Records in five compilation volumes each. A special DVD collection containing the five flashback episodes—episodes 1, 5, 9, 12, and 16—was released on May 26, 2004, and a five-disc DVD box set was released on July 22, 2004. A two-part novelization of the anime and an official guide book to the adaptation were published in April 2004. The English-language dubbing of the Twin Spica anime premiered on Animax Asia on January 24, 2005.|$|E

5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to <b>its</b> <b>conclusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} Congress {{that the}} FBI started looking into newly discovered emails.

The two-part adventure was adapted into the 1969 film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun by Belvision Studios, the first feature-length animated Tintin film. Prisoners of the Sun has also been adapted into two episodes of the 1990s television series The Adventures of Tintin, a video game, and a 2001 musical stage production.|$|E
