5|$|Although {{defeated}} in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one for years to come. Landon had received some 6,000 letters commiserating {{with him in his}} defeat; Willkie received over 100,000. Financially independent, he was in no <b>hurry</b> to decide among the many offers of employment from top law firms and major corporations. He resumed his affair with Van Doren.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on {{the morning}} of 2 January, Viet Cong scouts around the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi {{reported}} hearing the sounds of truck and boat engines, so Hoang issued an alert order which prompted his troops to pick up their weapons and <b>hurry</b> to their foxholes. Most of the women, children, and old men in both hamlets fled and hid in the nearby swamps as soon as the order was issued.|$|E

5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great <b>hurry.</b> The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|If {{the bell}} was rung, {{it would have}} been most likely rung by Andrew McNair, who was the doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of the Congress, and was {{responsible}} for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, it might have been rung by William <b>Hurry,</b> who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.|$|E

Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a stop sign at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|Needing to <b>hurry,</b> the Patriot militia put 900 men {{on horseback}} and rode for Kings Mountain. They left immediately, marching {{through the night}} of the 6th and morning of the 7th, even though the rain never stopped. By sunrise of the 7th, they forded the Broad River, fifteen miles from Kings Mountain. By early {{afternoon}} they arrived and immediately surrounded the ridge and attacked.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the London trip, Jinnah was in no <b>hurry</b> to reach an agreement, {{considering}} that time would allow him to gain the undivided provinces of Bengal and Punjab for Pakistan, but these wealthy, populous provinces had sizeable non-Muslim minorities, complicating a settlement. The Attlee ministry desired a rapid British departure from the subcontinent, but had little confidence in Wavell to achieve that end. Beginning in December 1946, British officials began looking for a viceregal successor to Wavell, and soon fixed on Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a war leader popular among Conservatives as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and among Labour for his political views.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then <b>hurry</b> to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E

5|$|In 580, Hormizd IV {{abolished}} the Caucasian Iberian monarchy, and turned Iberia into a Persian province {{ruled by a}} marzpan (governor). During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides. In 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to <b>hurry</b> to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, <b>hurry</b> back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{calls the}} medical {{examiner}} who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle Parker back to the ranch and that Parker's blood test has revealed his father's blood type in his stomach. Mulder and Tskany <b>hurry</b> to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, {{and then they were}} attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion is still in its cage.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no <b>hurry,</b> they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
5|$|The Lisowczycy entered {{northern}} Hungary (now Slovakia) and in 1619 {{defeated the}} Transylvanian forces at the Battle of Humenné. Prince Bethlen Gábor of Transylvania, who {{together with the}} Czechs had laid siege to Vienna, had to <b>hurry</b> back to his country and make peace with Ferdinand, which seriously compromised {{the situation of the}} Czech insurgents, crushed in the course and {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of White Mountain. Afterwards the Lisowczycy ruthlessly fought to suppress the Emperor's opponents in Glatz (Kłodzko) region and elsewhere in Silesia, in Bohemia and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrim Tercentenary Commission made {{sketches}} for a design, {{which were}} converted to three-dimensional plaster models by Cyrus E.

As the legislation was not approved until May 12, 1920, and the commission hoped to have the coins available for sale as early as possible, Dallin was urged to <b>hurry</b> with his work. The selection of Dallin apparently delighted Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) chairman Charles Moore, who wrote to the sculptor in convivial terms.|$|E
