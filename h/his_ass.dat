500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's going to get <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> kicked like he's never gotten <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's {{going to change the}} image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E

500|$|Mitch Pileggi was {{disappointed}} {{in the fact that}} the episode featured his character, Walter Skinner, getting beat up, something which had occurred in multiple episodes already by this point: [...] "I was feeling a little uncomfortable with him getting <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> kicked so much, and I think the fans were, too." [...] Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana, made a small cameo, along with his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood, in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building. Grohl, who has an active interest in UFO lore, called the episode [...] "his acting debut".|$|E

Joyce called the Donald ruling [...] "the biggest call of my career", claiming that [...] "I thought [...] beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay". The umpire later said, [...] "I didn't want this to be my 15 minutes of fame. I would have liked my 15 minutes to be a great call in the World Series. Hopefully, my 15 minutes are over now".|$|E
500|$|Gunn {{revealed}} that character introductions were the [...] "hardest scenes to crack", with Thanos' introduction {{being the most}} difficult. He felt that [...] "having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [...] {{than it was to}} Guardians of the Galaxy," [...] yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without [...] " [...] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan." [...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought that was interesting, because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Chaplin's silent films {{typically}} {{follow the}} Tramp's efforts {{to survive in}} a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives {{to be seen as a}} gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, [...] "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity." [...] The Tramp defies authority figures and [...] "gives as good as he gets", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an [...] "everyman turned heroic saviour". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with [...] "the homeless and lonely Tramp [...] optimistically... into the sunset... to continue his journey".|$|E

500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went looking for this dude to kick <b>his</b> <b>ass.</b> Nobody was going to replace Duane and the very thought of it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

In both mythologems the reed has a very similar function: it transfers a message which cannot be uttered to any human being. In this way the reed uncovers the mystery that allows the hero to save {{a group of people}} or even mankind. The analysis is based on the variants of the myth of king Midas presented by William Crooke in his essay King Midas and <b>His</b> <b>Ass’s</b> Ears and two Mesopotamian epics about the flood, Atrahasis and The Epic of Gilgamesh, which include The Sumerian Flood Story.

500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Transformer" [...] according to producer and featured guest Swizz Beatz in a September 2009 interview with MTV News. The song {{was set to}} be the first real record that Brown had released since [...] with then-girlfriend Rihanna {{at the beginning of the}} year. Another song [...] "Changed Man", an [...] "apologetic ode to Rihanna" [...] written by Brown, and several other tracks were leaked but Jive Records said the material was old. Swizz Beatz said that Brown had recorded [...] "60 or 70" [...] songs for the album, and that [...] "He's got something to prove." [...] Beatz also commented on Lil Wayne's contribution to the song, saying, [...] ""The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about, He really showed <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> on this one. It's probably the best feature verse since the 'It's Me ' remix. He really went in on the 'Transformer' joint." [...] It was originally supposed released on September 30, 2009, but Brown stated on his Twitter that the song would be released a day early on September 29, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E

500|$|Drake's {{physical}} attractiveness {{has been}} {{another area of}} commentary, {{with at least one}} reviewer declaring a man crush for him. Drake has been described as [...] "dreamy", and a [...] "handsome, charismatic hero." [...] Claudia Black, voice of Chloe Frazer from , admitted having a crush on Drake as well. Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in what I would call a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude". In 2014, La Nueva España included him the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders.|$|E
500|$|In metaphors {{carried over}} from the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{describes}} marriage as a prison and women as slaves within it in The Wrongs of Woman. In the first chapter Maria laments, [...] " [...] not the world a vast prison, and women born slaves?" [...] and later she makes a politically charged allusion to the French prison, the Bastille: [...] "marriage had bastilled me for life". Moreover, Maria's body is bought and sold like a slave's: she is worth £5,000 on the open marriage market and her new husband attempts to sell her into prostitution. Commenting on her condition, Maria states: [...] "a wife being as much a man's property as his horse, or <b>his</b> <b>ass,</b> she has nothing she can call her own". In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft had used the metaphor of slavery not only to describe the horrors of marriage as it currently existed but also to offer a juxtaposition {{to the possibility of}} a new kind of marriage, one which assumed equality between affectionate and rational partners. In The Wrongs of Woman, this option is never presented; instead, the reader is shown a series of disastrous marriages in which women are abused, robbed, and abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{is often}} {{at the center of}} the action and fight sequences. Browder joked for years that [...] "Mitchell's super power is getting <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> whipped", which was the {{opposite}} of the powerful warrior Teal'c. Browder enjoyed the physicality of the role and wanted to do many of his own stunts. Browder had acquired first fight experiences in drama school, and had done much stunt work on Farscape. Browder worked with fight choreographers in seasons 9 and 10 of Stargate SG-1. Browder's first fight sequence on SG-1 was a sword fight with a knight in [...] "Avalon", where Browder did not have a stunt double and used real swords because heavy swords look more real in action. This fight was followed by an elaborate fight to the death with a Sodan Jaffa warrior in [...] "Babylon". Although writer Paul Mullie was concerned that fans might be put off by the violence and darkness of [...] "Collateral Damage", where Mitchell has memories of beating a love interest to death, the producers did not want to shortchange Mitchell's emotional journey and chose to not shy away from violence in the episode. Browder played another sword fight in [...] "Camelot", and was involved in an extended hand-to-hand combat with a Replicator-possessed IOA member James Marrick (played by Currie Graham) in The Ark of Truth.|$|E
6000|$|Then Ali Baba {{climbed down}} {{and went to}} the door {{concealed}} among the bushes, and said: [...] "Open, Sesame!" [...] and it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man {{in the form of a}} vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise--silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought <b>his</b> <b>asses,</b> which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: [...] "Shut, Sesame!" [...] he closed the door and went home.|$|R

500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on <b>his</b> <b>ass,</b> which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E
500|$|Robin Williams as The Genie, a comedic genie, with nigh omnipotent {{power that}} can only be {{exercised}} when his master wishes it. The Genie's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg. Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Robin Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of Williams' stand-up to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams [...] "laugh <b>his</b> <b>ass</b> off" [...] and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams' appearance in Aladdin (despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film [...] ) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film. Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions, which were re-adapted into the fabric of the character. These included Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. Williams also voices the Peddler, a mysterious merchant who appears {{at the beginning of the}} film. After promoting useless goods to the audience, he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin. The scene was completely unscripted — the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects without looking at them and describe them in-character. The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised, but that idea was dropped later in development. Bruce Adler supplies the singing voice for the Peddler, with Williams singing as Genie.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave <b>his</b> <b>ass,</b> but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
50|$|His {{long term}} aim to reach Lake Rudolf (now known as Lake Turkana) was {{attained}} on an expedition conducted in 1895. However the hunting around Lake Rudolf {{was not a}} success as the terrain was difficult and a bitter wind blew. On New Year's Day 1896 his personal servant, Shebane, {{was killed by a}} crocodile whilst bathing and many of <b>his</b> <b>asses</b> were stricken from the bite of the Tsetse fly. Neumann records that he downed a number of large animals before his gun misfired allowing an angry cow elephant to maul him. His injuries were severe enough to force a recuperation period lasting several months during which he could not take solids with any comfort. It curtailed the hunting but he made use of his time collecting specimens in the Lorighi Mountains for the British Museum including a previously unrecorded race of hartebeest to which the name Bubalis Neumannii was ascribed. He returned to Mombasa with the ivory and the specimens in October 1896 in poor physical health and sporting an injured and withered arm.|$|R
