He wanted to serve {{as commander in chief}} of the Confederate armies but said he would serve wherever directed. His wife Varina Davis later wrote that when he received word that he had been chosen as president, [...] "Reading that telegram <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> grieved that I feared some evil had befallen our family." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2005, Jackson {{revealed}} {{that he had lost}} [...] due to bariatric surgery. In Ebony, Joe Madison {{revealed that}} when he and Jackson were on a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation conference he asked Jackson why <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> different. He stated that Jackson described having undergone a duodenal switch medical procedure that his sister, Santita, had used to lose [...] over several years.|$|E
500|$|Raich Carter {{once said}} of Frank Swift that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> big in goal {{that as a}} forward it often seemed that trying to score against him {{was like trying to}} put the ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were {{sufficiently}} large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and gave rise to the nickname [...] "Frying Pan Hands". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew felt that the costume and make-up artists {{did a good job}} with Albert Welling, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> much like Hitler it was a [...] "surreal" [...] experience. Ella Kenion, who plays Harriet in this episode, later {{appeared}} in the Fourth Doctor audio drama The Wrath of the Iceni where she played Boudica. Darvill was pleased that his character, Rory, was more of an [...] "action hero" [...] in the episode. Before broadcast, Smith stated that it was [...] "maybe [...] favorite episode to date...it just rockets along". Smith's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket, a long dark-green military overcoat, {{for the first time in}} this episode. In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor's costume, executive producer Piers Wenger said, [...] "I think he'd really like to evolve it next series. He's really keen to have a coat." [...] Smith explained that he wanted a coat because of the cold weather.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kate Flannery {{later said}} that the days of filming were {{extremely}} [...] "hot", and she became sick of hot dogs after eating {{many of them in}} the contest seen in the episode. Many cast members spit out the hot dogs after putting them in their mouths, an act that sometimes activated Ed Helms' gag reflex. The cast members found the sumo suits uncomfortable, both due to the hot weather and the inability to sit down. Actress Angela Kinsey previewed before the episode broadcast that she would [...] "forever look at John Krasinski differently, because <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> hilarious to me" [...] wearing his sumo suit. For the scenes of Helms floating in the lake in his sumo suit, the actor wore a harness and a fishing line that snaked out through his sleeve, the purpose being to drag him farther out on the lake. A crew member pulled him in a row boat; the crew would film a take of the scene, and then would have to wait fifteen minutes to do it again.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Larry Drake as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless, sadistic mob {{boss and}} the head of his own {{criminal}} organization. He auditioned for the film and Raimi liked the way he underplayed the character, [...] "quiet and careful, yet intense," [...] the actor remembers. The director had never seen L.A. Law but found that Drake's face reminded him of [...] "a modern day Edward G. Robinson. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, he has a good physical presence â€“ what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I {{hastened to}} console him.|$|E

50|$|Tanaka's classmate. He is {{cool and}} intelligent, {{but has a}} {{weakness}} for girls. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> different when not wearing eyeglasses that he cannot be recognized.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} {{recognized}} him anywhere," [...] she answered simply. [...] "I {{wonder what they}} are talking about. She seems <b>so</b> interested, and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> bored." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much, but I'd like to, <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> kind," [...] {{answered}} Nat, whose chief {{knowledge of}} the Good Man consisted in hearing His name taken in vain.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook his}} head, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> mild now that Tessa felt quite at her ease.|$|E
60|$|I gasped. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{capable of}} doing {{anything}} he took it into his head to do.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> attentively {{at me that}} I looked attentively at him {{and felt}} sure I {{understood}} him.|$|E

6000|$|Harry {{looked over}} the screen. [...] "Yes, he is dead enough; anyhow <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so.</b> Waal, this {{is a piece of}} luck." [...] They all stepped out on to the platform.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, Peter, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> fierce.' This, unfortunately, is true. I do look fierce. It {{is rather}} a misfortune for a {{perfectly}} peaceful dog. 'I'm sure it's not safe your having him.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> sad, and yet withal so comical, that I {{held out}} my hand to him, laughing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> hostile that I {{thought he}} was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.|$|E

6000|$|Warn. [Peeping.] Death! this abominable fool will spoil all again. Damn him, {{he stands}} making his grimaces yonder; and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> earnestly upon his mistress, that he hears me not. [...] [Rings again.|$|R
60|$|Pand. Swords, or bucklers, faulchions, darts, and lances! any thing, {{he cares}} not! an' the devil come, {{it is all}} one to him: by Jupiter <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> terribly, that I am half afraid to praise him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{very much}} astonished, that Bella {{could not make}} up her mind to break it to him just yet.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no! You must not--I {{will beat}} him--and {{tell him he}} is bad; then he shall not do such things again. Now he is sulky; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> always when <b>he</b> is sulky. Is this your home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mel True, my dear, {{when he was}} {{a private}} man he was a figure; but since he is a king, methinks he has assumed another figure: <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> grand, and so august! [...] [Going to the King.|$|R
