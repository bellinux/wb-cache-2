40|$|The {{first problem}} was to {{determine}} the capability of a ground support equipment (GSE) rack <b>knee</b> <b>bracket</b> for handling a spacelab rack. The geometric center of gravity was calculated for the upper and lower part of the rack and found to be in the center of gravity's allowable envelope. The second problem {{was to determine}} the exact margin of safety for an axial load and a shear load on a bolt. The equation for failure is axial load squared plus shear load cubed equal one. The third problem was to simplify an expression for stress on a generic non-symmetrical bolt configuration to a form familiar to 'bolt people'. The final problem was the structural analysis of the spacelab rack corner posts...|$|E
