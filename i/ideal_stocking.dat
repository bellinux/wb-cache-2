40|$|The overabundant {{proliferation}} of aquatic weeds in South African water conveyance systems cause {{a series of}} operational problems. Filamentous algae, such as Cladophora glomerata and pondweeds impede flow and reduce the capacity of irrigation canals to a significant extent. In worst case scenarios, irrigation scheme managers are faced with situations where {{they are unable to}} deliver water at the downstream ends of canal systems. This situation also contributes to water losses, crop losses and structural damage to concrete-lined canals. This dissertation {{is the product of a}} research project funded by the Water Research Commission to investigate the possible application of sterile (triploid) grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) as biological control agent on aquatic weeds in concrete-lined irrigation canals. The aims of the project were firstly to investigate the suitability of a concrete-lined irrigation canal as grass carp habitat; secondly to test the efficacy of sterile grass carp as bio-control agent on filamentous algae; thirdly to evaluate the economic feasibility of this biological approach against the current chemical, physical and mechanical control methods; and fourthly to propose a management plan for the operational application of triploid grass carp as bio-control agent in irrigation canals. To achieve the goals set for the project, the Ramah- 3 Canal near the town of Orania, was selected to serve as experimental canal. This canal can be regarded as a typical South African concrete-lined canal, and is located in the Orange-Riet River Canal System, downstream of the Vanderkloof Dam. As the majority of local irrigation canals are concrete-lined, skepticism existed amongst local scientists if the fish will be able survive in canals with a presumed high constant flow and low diversity of hydraulic biotopes. It was therefore a priority to establish the suitability of concrete-lined canals as habitat for this herbivorous fish specie. The study found that flow velocities in the Ramah Canal System never exceeded 1 m/s, even under high flow conditions (full capacity and 110 % plus conditions) of more than 5 m 3 /s. It was found that grass carp thrived at flow rates ranging from 0. 48 to 0. 80 m/s, moving with ease upstream and downstream in a 16 km long experimental section of the Ramah- 3 Canal. The sterile grass carp controlled the algal biomass in the Ramah Canal to significant levels. Cladophora was efficiently controlled at stocking rates of 3 to 7 fish per km canal. Triploid grass carp retrieved from the canal system after a six-month experimental period were found to be in an excellent physiological condition and displayed a mean weight increase of more than 300 %. An <b>ideal</b> <b>stocking</b> protocol will probably be 10 individuals of 20 – 30 cm in length per kilometer canal, with a 10 - 15 % annual supplementation figure. Civil structures, such as culverts, super-elevated canals and bridges will provide the fish with sufficient protection against possible predators. A few possible adaptations to the existing canal operation regimes should ensure that triploid grass carp could be managed as an effective biological control agent. This should be determined on a site-specific basis and could include additional civil structures such as sanctuary dams and small in-line fishways to ensure free migration throughout the target system. An attempt was made to conduct a brief economic analysis, based on information on expenditures of local irrigation schemes on aquatic weed control in their canals. The outcome of this brief investigation was in line with overseas findings in that biological control with sterile grass carp will be more economical than the currently applied control methods of herbicidal and mechanical or physical control. It can be concluded that the fish adapted to the artificial conditions experienced in a concrete-lined canal and perform their task as bio-control agent with ease. The author is of the opinion that this bio-control technique will contribute to the current Integrated Aquatic Weed Management Programmes (IAWMPs) of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. Site-specific conditions for each irrigation scheme will however, dictate a different approach to the aquatic weed problem. It is therefore strongly recommended that suitable qualified specialists should develop all aquatic weed management programmes on a site-specific basis. Prof. G. J. Stey...|$|E
40|$|Pearl {{culture is}} the second largest {{aquaculture}} industry {{in terms of value}} in Australia. It is currently worth an estimated Aus 300 million annually and it is anticipated that the industry will be worth Aus 500 million by 2010. The Australian pearl industry is currently based on South Sea pearl production from the silver-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, for which it is world renowned. However, there has been recent interest in pearl production from two other major marine pearl oyster species, the blacklip pearl oyster, P. margaritifera, and the Akoya pearl oyster, P. fucata, which are both abundant in Australian waters. Production of Akoya pearls, until recently was dominated by the Japanese. However, recent down-scaling of the Japanese pearl oyster industry due to factors that resulted in the death of millions of oysters, has presented an opportunity for other countries to enter the Akoya pearl market. Australia is one such country which has received {{a lot of interest in}} Akoya pearl production over the last 5 - 10 years because of: (1) its reputation as a quality pearl producing nation; (2) the clean non-polluted waters around Australia; and (3) the wide distribution of Akoya oysters along the Australian coastline. Consequently, there was a need for biological information on which the feasibility of Akoya pearl oyster culture in Australia could be assessed. The major objective of the current project was to develop techniques to determine whether Akoya pearl oyster culture is feasible in tropical north Queensland. The results of this study will compliment the results of research with similar goals conducted in temperate Australia (New South Wales). The focus of this study was to produce Akoya pearl oysters in tropical Australia for the first time, before optimizing protocols for hatchery and nursery culture. This information was then utilized to suggest possible sites within Queensland which would be suitable for Akoya pearl oyster production, based on ‘biological performance’. The first successful culture of Akoya pearl oysters in Australia under tropical conditions produced 213 000 larvae which were transferred to settlement tanks. A total of 58 000 spat were subsequently transferred from settlement tank and resulted in 48 000 spat ranging in size from 2 - 30 mm at 3. 5 months of age. These spat were produced using established protocols for other pearl oyster species. After 12 months, Akoya pearl oysters had a mean dorso-ventral shell height (DVH) of 56. 2 ± 0. 2 mm and showed superior growth rate to those reported for this species in more traditional culture regions (i. e. SE Asia). This project investigated aspects of hatchery production including embryonic and larval development to identify optimal protocols for hatchery culture of Akoya pearl oysters (Chapters 4 and 5). Full orthogonal designs were established to investigate; (1) the effects of water temperature and salinity; and (2) the effects of density and addition of antibiotics on the development of P. fucata embryos into D-stage veligers. Maximum development of P. fucata embryos into D-stage veligers occurs within a water temperature range of 26 - 28 °C and a salinity range of 28 - 32 ‰. Further results suggested that antibiotics are not required during embryonic development of P. fucata as development of larvae was not improved in the presence antibiotics. Results have also shown that maximum development of embryos into D-stage veliger occurred when larval stocking densities were low. Suggesting an <b>ideal</b> <b>stocking</b> density is strongly dependant on the individual hatchery and the production goals. These results have obvious implications for the selection of sites for an Akoya oyster hatchery in Queensland. Ideally, a site should be selected in which water parameters are within the above-mentioned ranges. A number of pearl oyster culture techniques were investigated during this project to optimise nursery culture of Akoya pearl oysters under Queensland (tropical) conditions. These included the effects of depth, stocking density, culture apparatus and fouling on the growth and survival of pearl oysters. P. fucata spat were transferred from the hatchery to the long-line and placed in plastic mesh trays at three different depths, 2 m, 4 m, and 6 m. After 8 weeks on the long-line, spat cultured at 2 m were significantly (p< 0. 05) larger in DVH than spat at either 4 m or 6 m, which were not significantly different from each other. Additionally, greater numbers of ‘large’ spat were recorded when spat cultured at 2 m compared to spat cultured at either 4 m or 6 m. Hatchery-produced P. fucata spat at 3. 5 months of age were graded into three size classes, ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’, which for the purpose of the study were treated as ‘slow’, ‘normal’ and ‘fast’ growers, respectively. This study aimed to determine whether growth rates differed between oysters from the above-mentioned size classes. Results from this study suggest that when oysters are first graded at 3. 5 months of age (8 weeks after transfer to the ocean) slow growing oysters should not be discarded (common practice by some pearl farmers within the industry). This is because slow growers, when compared to ‘normal’ growers, only require an additional 2 - 4 months before reaching pearl production size. The implications of retaining slow growers is discussed. Hatchery-produced spat were cultured at different stocking densities to determine optimal growth and survival of P. fucata. Stocking densities were determined on the basis of percentage of total available net area. In Experiment 1 during early nursery culture, spat were stocked at either 25...|$|E

Molecular modeling of galectins in complex with aromatic lactose 2 -O-esters, as well as binding studies with a galectin- 3 R 186 S mutant, confirmed that the inhibitory efficiency of the lactose 2 -O-esters was due to the formation of strong interactions between the aromatic ester moieties and the arginine guanidinium groups of galectin- 1 and - 3.

The results showed that Glu-A 1 a produced the highest SDS-sedimentation volume (Ssd), midline time x= 8 width (MTxW), mixing tolerance (MT) and the lowest weakening slope (WS). At the Glu-B 1 locus, Glu-B 1 f produced the highest values for all quality parameters but WS. At the Glu-D 1 locus, Glu-D 1 d was the best for Ssd, grain hardness (GH), midline peak width (MPW), MTxW and MT. The positive effects of Glu-B 1 f on GH and Glu-B 3 b on Ssd were mainly from the effect of GPC. Overall, 5 interactive loci and 13 interactive alleles {{were found to be}} significant.

Managing all inputs necessary for these complex aerospace supply chains is a task that {{is critical to the}} success of any firm and requires extensive planning, close partnerships, and detailed analysis. This thesis outlines a system for optimal safety stock management in high volume aerospace supply chains. Given such supply chain parameters as component inventory values, procurement and manufacturing lead times, demand distributions, and bills of material, the <b>ideal</b> safety <b>stock</b> locations and sizes which result in minimal overall inventory levels are calculated by a nonlinear optimization program. With this safety stock structure, aerospace firms can operate their supply chains with higher customer service rates and lower inventory levels. A methodology is also developed to help aerospace companies improve their existing supply chains as efficiently as possible. Considering the limited time and resources available, a company may not be able to enhance all areas of its operations and determining where to improve with the greatest effect on customer service levels and inventory can be difficult. The framework developed provides general guidelines to ensure improvement resources are being deployed most efficiently.

The nursery pond is {{the smallest of the}} major fishpond compartment ranging from 500 to 5, 000 m 2, and is about 10 % of the total farming area. The pond is prepared with utmost care to eliminate predators and competitors. The area should have good topography, is free from flooding and should have soil with good water retention properties for good dike construction and efficient culture management. Water supply should be adequate year-round and free from pollutants. Good pond water quality is maintained and natural food should be adequate to enhance growth and survival. With high stocking densities, supplemental feed is also provided. The three types of nurseries are based on feed sources: lablab, plankton with supplemental feeding and direct feeding. Select hatchery-reared fry (21 day old) that swim actively in schools, are uniform in size, have robust body, and are resistant to handling and transport stress. The <b>ideal</b> fry <b>stocking</b> density is 5 - 40 pieces/m 2. Survival ranging from 50 - 90 % can be expected after 25 - 45 days of rearing. Harvest, packing, transport, acclimation and stocking of the fry or fingerlings are carefully done during the cooler part of the day. Economic indicators show that fingerlings production is a profitable business. The improvement of milkfish grow-out technology from extensive or traditional to modified-extensive, semi-intensive and intensive culture in ponds, pens or in sea cages has increased demand for good quality fingerlings. Mass {{production of}} hatchery-reared fingerlings in earthen nursery ponds during peak season of fry availability can help bridge the supply gap. A steady supply of fingerlings for a whole year s operation will further increase production and ensure a sustainable supply of affordable market-sized fish...|$|R
50|$|In 1883 Pierre gets to America and {{travels to}} Chicago {{to learn more}} about the range stock {{business}} before investing any capital. There he meets the Marquis de Mores who tells him of the prairies in North Dakota and Montana. Wibaux decides to settle there and builds his ranch on what was formerly known as Beaver Creek. The conditions in the area are <b>ideal</b> for raising <b>stock</b> and Wibaux quickly finds himself owning well over 10 000 heads of cattle.Business thrives until the region is hit by an extremely harsh winter in 1886-87. It is estimated that around 70% of the cattle in the area perish in the long snowstorms. Pierre Wibaux saw an opportunity in this: only the sturdiest and most resilient beasts survived this trial, so Pierre went back to France to borrow the necessary funds to buy out all the remaining cattle from desperate neighbouring ranchers and low prices. Also, the shortage of beef available ensured high sale prices for Wibaux's stock for the following 3 years. In the 1890s, Wibaux had amassed one of the largest herds in the world, with over 65 000 cattle heads and 300 horses. This prestige earns him the friendship of a certain Theodore Roosevelt, a fellow Montana cattle-rancher who would give up the stock business to go on and become the 26th president of the United States from 1901 to 1909.|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{requested}} by the State of Colorado {{as a response to}} funding provided to the Colorado School of Mines through C. R. S. § 25 - 1 - 1303. The timing is <b>ideal</b> to take <b>stock</b> of the carbon sequestration opportunities here in Colorado, because sequestration is becoming a major new growth industry {{in many parts of the}} world, and Colorado is well poised to benefit from this trend. Geological carbon sequestration is a technology where concentrated sources of CO 2 can be compressed, injected and stored in depleted oil and gas fields, major deep aquifers (‘saline brines’), and coal seems in the subsurface. In light of the historical strength in minerals science and engineering of Colorado’s industries and research universities (particularly CSM), and the public determination to reduce atmospheric emissions of CO 2 as a climate change mitigation measure, Colorado has the technical skills and public will to help build a technology foundation to clean up the hydrocarbon energy industry. More than 30 years of global climate research has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that man-made CO 2 emissions, mostly from the burning of hydrocarbons, have created a pattern of global warming that is beginning to take an enormous toll on the planet’s economic infrastructure as well as ecological systems.

40|$|Palm oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} vegetable oils in the world because of its unique physical properties. It imparts a very high stability to the β’ crystal form, yielding relatively small crystals which give a smooth texture and due to its naturally balanced fatty acid composition palm oil is semi-solid at room temperature. As such, it forms an <b>ideal</b> hard <b>stock</b> to be used in trans free food products. However from a nutritional point of view, palm oil contains too much saturated fatty acids, since their presence in the diet is among the factors contributing to cardio-vascular diseases. When using more unsaturated fats as hard stock, minor components (including structuring agents like lecithin) can be added in order to avoid compromising the functionality of the food product. Therefore, industry’s interest in the use of emulsifiers as minor components in the production of edible fat products to give them desirable melting and crystallization properties is continuously increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of commercially available monoglycerides (M), polyglycerol esters (P) and lecithin (L) on the crystallization behavior of bulk fat as a function of the added concentration. Not only a single type of emulsifier, but also binary and ternary mixtures of M, P and L were added to the two different ‘host’ fats. The first was a palm based margarine fat, while the other was a non-hydrogenated vegetable fat, not based on palm oil which is used in fat rich products with a low amount of saturated fatty acids. A statistically sound mixture design was used to obtain as much information as possible. The obtained mixtures were analyzed for their non-isothermal crystallization and melting behavior by DSC. If a single type of emulsifier was added, the crystallization is accelerated due to heterogenous nucleation by adding M or P, while L addition has no significant effect on the crystallization rate. Furthermore it was shown that the minimum concentration necessary to provoke a crystallization accelerating effect is lower for P than for M. Antagonistic effects between M and L were suggested by the coefficient estimates of the special cubic model. When mixing the three emulsifiers a slight synergistic effect is observed, but the onset of crystallization is never higher than when pure M or P are added. When focusing on the melting behavior, emulsifiers (pure and in mixtures) reduce the offset of melting of both ‘host’ fats. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Always Available retail {{replenishment}} business at NIKE is to ensure consumer-essential products are in-stock at retailers at all times. To achieve this goal, NIKE has developed a forecast-driven, make-to-stock supply chain model which allows retailers to place weekly orders to an on-hand inventory position in a distribution center. The challenge facing the business is how to design an inventory strategy that achieves {{a high level of}} service to its customers while minimizing inventory holding cost. Specifically, safety stock holding cost is targeted as it accounts for the majority of on-hand inventory and can be reduced without significantly impacting the underlying supply chain architecture. This thesis outlines the application of multi-echelon inventory optimization in a retail replenishment business model. This technique is used to determine where and how much safety stock should be staged throughout the supply chain in order to minimize safety stock holding cost for a fixed service level. Provided a static supply chain network, the <b>ideal</b> safety <b>stock</b> locations and quantities which result in minimal total safety stock holding cost is determined. For this business, the optimal solution is to stage lower-cost component materials with long supplier lead times and high commonality across multiple finished goods at the manufacturer in addition to finished goods at the distribution centers. Safety stock holding cost reduction from component staging increases significantly when the distance between manufacturers and the distribution center decreases and for those factories producing a variety of finished goods made from the same component materials due to inventory pooling. Forecast accuracy drives the quantity of safety stock in the network. The removal of low volume, highly unpredictable products from the portfolio yields significant inventory holding cost savings without a detrimental impact to revenue. By deploying the optimal safety stock staging solution and by removing unpredictable products, this analysis shows that finish goods safety stock inventory would be reduced by 35 % for the modeling period (calendar year 2012) while only decreasing topline revenue by 5 %. by Benjamin M.

40|$|A {{functioning}} {{stock market}} is {{an essential component of}} a competitive economy, since it provides a mechanism for allocating the economy’s capital <b>stock.</b> In an <b>ideal</b> situation, the <b>stock</b> market will steer capital in a manner that maximizes the total utility of the economy. As prices of traded stocks depend on and vary with information available to investors, it is apparent that information plays a crucial role in a functioning stock market. However, even though information indisputably matters, several issues regarding how stock markets process and react to new information still remain unanswered. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the link between new information and stock market reactions. The first essay utilizes new methodological tools in order to investigate the average reaction of investors to new financial statement information. The second essay explores the behavior of different types of investors when new financial statement information is disclosed to the market. The third essay looks into the interrelation between investor size, behavior and overconfidence. The fourth essay approaches the puzzle of negative skewness in stock returns from an altogether different angle than previous studies. The first essay presents evidence of the second derivatives of some financial statement signals containing more information than the first derivatives. Further, empirical evidence also indicates that some of the investigated signals proxy risk while others contain information priced with a delay. The second essay documents different categories of investors demonstrating systematical differences in their behavior when new financial statement information arrives to the market. In addition, a theoretical model building on differences in investor overconfidence is put forward in order to explain the observed behavior. The third essay shows that investor size describes investor behavior very well. This finding is predicted by the model proposed in the second essay, and hence strengthens the model. The behavioral differences between investors of different size furthermore have significant economic implications. Finally, the fourth essay finds strong evidence of management news disclosure practices causing negative skewness in stock returns...|$|R

Introduction: To be {{successful}} {{in this day and age}} of specialists attention must be paid to the smallest and most insignificant details of any profession or line of work pursued by man. It is these seemingly little, unimportant things that are the cases of so many failures and small profits. They may be the last straw and if neglected cause disastrous results. The old adage, “Save your pennies and the dollars will care for themselves, “applies to many things other than finances. In the industry of stock-raising this tendency to neglect little matters is perhaps as notorious or more so than in any other line of business. The average farmer supplies the absolutely necessary requirements that are demanded by stock, such as food and a place of confinement, regardless of its quality benefits or condition. The animals likes or dislikes are not taken into consideration, nor is the convenience, comfort, and health of conditions furnished, regarded from the animal’s standpoint. To raise stock with maximum success a farmer must take into consideration all the factors that influence the growth and development of his cattle,. He must sort out and eliminate or modify influences that are unfavorable and encourage and establish those that are favorable. In other words there are ideal conditions under which cattle will grow and develop to the best advantage and the nearer to those <b>ideal</b> conditions the <b>stock</b> are put the more successfully they can be grown. Among other conditions that go to make up the ideal is one that is included under the general term, comfort, and the object of the following production is to discuss and emphasize the influence of the different factors in the environment of cattle that have to do with the comfort and contentment of the animal...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho provém de um estágio curricular efectuado no ano lectivo de 2008 / 2009 na Bosch Termotecnologia SA, sediada em Aveiro. No âmbito da obtenção do grau de mestre em Engenharia e Gestão Industrial, foi desenvolvido um projecto no departamento de logística, no seio da equipa do LOG 1, responsável pelo serviço ao cliente. O trabalho incide sobre a gestão de um mercado estratégico, mais precisamente, o mercado dos Estados Unidos (TTNA). Devido à irregularidade que este mercado acarreta, achou-se viável alterar o sistema de produção em utilização, para uma filosofia pull. Os principais objectivos da implementação do sistema pull-flow são, a redução de stock em ambas as entidades, bem como reduzir a flutuação de encomendas que o mercado da TTNA apresentava. Numa primeira fase, foi realizado um estudo de mercado, quer isto dizer, identificados e apresentados os pontos onde o mercado se apresentava instável. A segunda fase dedica-se à implementação do pull-flow. O primeiro passo foi {{calcular}} o nível de <b>stock</b> <b>ideal</b> em ambas as cadeias, segundo o método {{reorder point}} (ROP). No Workshop realizado entre as duas entidades, ficou decidido que o ROP seria calculado por ambas, tendo sido posteriormente comparados os resultados e retiradas as devidas conclusões. Nos dias de crise em que se vive, é fundamental reduzir os custos da cadeia de abastecimento, como por exemplo o custo dos stocks, bem como melhorar o nível de serviço, tendo sido este o principal motor no desenvolvimento deste projecto. ABSTRACT: The present report results from an internship {{made in the}} 2008 / 2009 academic year at Bosch Termotecnologia SA, located in Aveiro. As part of obtaining a Master’s degree, was developed a project in the logistic department within the team responsible for the customer service (LOG 1). The work focuses on the management of a strategic market, more precisely, the United States market (TTNA). Due to the irregularity that leads the market, it {{was thought to be}} feasible to change the production system in use, to a pull philosophy. The main objectives of the implementation of the pull-flow, are the reduction of stock in both entities, as well as reduce the fluctuation of the orders sent by TTNA. Initially it was made a market study, i. e., identified and presented the points where market was unstable. The second phase focuses on the implementation of the pull-flow system, as a solution to the described problems. The first step was to calculate the optimal level of stock to have in both chains, according to the method reorder point (ROP). In the Workshop held between the two entities, it was decided that the ROP would be calculated from both, and at a later time the results were compared and the appropriate conclusions were taken. In the days of crisis in which the society is living, it is essential to reduce costs in the supply chain, like the costs of stock, as well as improve the client service level, being these points the main driver in developing this work.

40|$|Fish {{stocking}} is {{a popular}} management tool for freshwater and marine fisheries and is commonly used in impoundments to create or maintain recreational fisheries. The densities at which fish are stocked in these systems, however, often lack an ecological basis. The general aim of this thesis {{was to develop a}} stocking model which calculates stocking densities appropriate for an impoundment&# 146;s productive capacity. The Australian bass is a commonly stocked sport-fish in Australian impoundments and is used in this study as a model organism to demonstrate how species ecology (Chapters 2 and 3), population dynamics (Chapters 4 and 5), and modelling (Chapter 6), can be combined to place stocking densities in a predictive, ecological framework. Analyses of the diet and habitat use of Australian bass indicated it is an adaptive species, exhibiting strong inter-individual variation {{in the use of the}} dietary and spatial niches, and therefore an <b>ideal</b> candidate for <b>stocking</b> in the hydrologically variable impoundments of Australia. The varied use of the spatial habitat justified the use of a production-based stocking model, given that food is likely to be the limiting resource, rather than access to a key habitat type. The dietary analysis also determined that zooplankton and phytoplankton were suitable sources of production for input into the stocking model. Annual and stochastic fluctuations in the volume of available habitat were observed, driven mainly by stratification and variable rainfall respectively. This justified the addition of a spatial component to the stocking model, which influences stocking density by altering both the total amount of production in the impoundment and the amount that is actually available to stocked fish. Quantitative methods of assessing the potential capacity of environments for stocked fish were reviewed, including methods for estimating carrying capacity. It was deduced that carrying capacity is a useful reference for determining population status and for calculating stocking densities that should not be exceeded, but should probably not be the target for most stocked fisheries, due to the increase in density-dependent losses when approaching this point. Production and self-thinning models were also reviewed and their use for determining stocking densities demonstrated. Self thinning (i. e. the body-mass &# 150; abundance relationship) was found to be useful for heavily stocked closed systems and fisheries with high exploitation rates. A manipulative experiment with Australian bass fingerlings in tanks tested this use of self-thinning theory. The experiment showed that the body-mass &# 150; abundance relationship in Australian bass generally matched theoretical predictions for food-limited populations, and that simple feeding experiments can determine the ontogeny of food-limited consumption. It was also demonstrated that density-dependent energy allocation can significantly alter the relationship, which is a novel finding with important theoretical implications for the role of group dynamics in population regulation. A stocking model incorporating trophic and dynamic-pool components estimated stocking densities in impoundments, consolidating much of the ecological data and theory of previous chapters. Stocking density was calculated by equating the energetic demand of stocked fish with an impoundment&# 146;s available surplus productivity. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to calculate probability distributions of stocking density for three New South Wales impoundments. A range of possible stocking densities was estimated for each impoundment, according to the minimum, average and maximum consumption rates by Australian bass. This approach demonstrates that stocking density can depend as much on a particular fishery&# 146;s objectives as the environment&# 146;s productive capacity. Similarity of modelled and actual estimates of population size offers support to the model&# 146;s accuracy. Variation in model outputs between impoundments and seasons highlights the need for ecologically-based stocking densities to be site-specific and demonstrates the value of incorporating the seasonality of consumption, production, and habitat availability...|$|R
