25|$|There is an {{area where}} Nanban is used {{exclusively}} to refer to a certain style, and that <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> and the names of dishes. Nanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. Some of these dishes resemble Southeast Asian cuisines but are so heavily changed to fit Japanese tastes like ramen that they should be considered separate.|$|E
25|$|Barbecuing {{encompasses}} {{four or five}} distinct {{types of}} cooking techniques. The original technique <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280°F or 115–145°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking, used a masonry oven or baking oven that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.|$|E

5000|$|The type II {{past tense}} active participle {{has become the}} base for the {{construction}} of the past tense (gotowałem) (I <b>was</b> <b>cooking)</b> and also the future complex tense (będę gotował) (I will <b>be</b> <b>cooking).</b> It <b>is</b> still used with some intransitive verbs (zgniły, zmokły) (rotten, soaked).|$|R
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it <b>is</b> <b>cooking,</b> first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Hannibal was {{met with}} {{significant}} media attention, with the film's stars and director making several appearances on television, in newspapers and in magazines. In an article for CBS News, Jill Serjeant stated that [...] "the long-awaited sequel to the grisly 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> up the hottest Internet and media buzz since the 1999 [...]" [...] Stars Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore made the covers {{of a number of}} magazines, including Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly, Premiere and Empire.|$|E
500|$|The title The Cookbook derived of Elliott feeling [...] "no two {{records are}} going to sound alike; each record has its own spices and herbs. Each record <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> up a hot recipe for a hot album." [...] The black and white cover {{features}} Elliott posing with a vintage microphone in a 1920s juke joint. She explained the cover, saying, [...] "I wanted people to see I was taking music back to the roots—not just hip hop, but our ancestors. Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing." ...|$|E

500|$|While [...] "celebrating the {{finalization}} of his divorce", Robert California (James Spader) drunkenly {{shuts down}} the Binghamton branch of Dunder Mifflin. The resulting commotion allows the sales team in Scranton, specifically Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to begin poaching former customers of the closed branch. Harry Jannerone (Chris Bauer), an angry employee from the Syracuse branch of Dunder Mifflin arrives in Scranton to berate Jim and Dwight for taking New York clients even though those particular clients {{are closer to}} Scranton than Syracuse. The two argue, dropping {{the name of a}} particularly large client, Prestige Direct Sale Solutions, that is up for grabs. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> lunch for everyone in the office, overhears the argument and gets an idea: if he can win the client, {{he might be able to}} use the account as leverage to get his job as manager back.|$|E
500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics of the {{presidency}} of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Argentina and many economists believe {{that the government has}} for years falsified consumer price data to understate the country's true inflation rate. The Economist stated in January 2011 that Big Mac index [...] "does support claims that Argentina’s government <b>is</b> <b>cooking</b> the books. The gap between its average annual rate of burger inflation (19%) and its official rate (10%) is far bigger than in any other country." [...] That year the press began reporting on unusual behavior by the more than 200 Argentinean McDonald's restaurants. They no longer prominently advertised Big Macs for sale and the sandwich, both individually and as part of value meals, was being sold for an unusually low price compared to other items. Guillermo Moreno, Secretary of Commerce in the Kirchner government, reportedly forced McDonald's to sell the Big Mac at an artificially low price to manipulate the country's performance on the Big Mac index. In June 2012, the price of the Big Mac value meal suddenly rose by 26%, closer to that of other meals, after The Economist, The New York Times, and other media reported on the unusual pricing. A Buenos Aires newspaper stated [...] "Moreno loses the battle".|$|E
