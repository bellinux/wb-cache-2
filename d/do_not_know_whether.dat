5|$|The Turks {{began to}} apply {{restrictions}} on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, {{in response to}} the start of the First Aliyah earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and notable classes, in 1901 the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the Young Turks – Turkish nationalists who had taken control of the Empire in 1908 – and the Second Aliyah, Arab nationalism was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E

Madame {{must also be}} used in the case where one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> the addressed woman is married or not and in the case where one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> the addressed woman consider the usage as discriminating or disrespectful.|$|R

25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them {{because they do not}} want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> to approach them forward or backward.|$|E
25|$|Where arable {{cultivation}} {{continued in}} early Anglo-Saxon England, {{there seems to}} have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, although we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.|$|E

25|$|Each {{category}} is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, {{such as the}} empty set or the product of two topologies, yet {{in the definition of}} a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> an object A is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest.|$|E
25|$|The Pharisees were a {{powerful}} force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence. After {{the fall of the}} Temple, the Pharisaic outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the House of Hillel, which had been founded by the eminent Tanna, Hillel the Elder, and the House of Shammai. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he agreed with their teachings on divorce. Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a) concerning the greatest commandment and the Golden Rule. Historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> there were Pharisees in Galilee during Jesus' life, or what they would have been like.|$|E
25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, {{in proportion to the}} sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E

25|$|The Annals, Tacitus' final work, {{covers the}} period from the death of Augustus Caesar in 14 AD. He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7–10 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends {{with the death of}} Tiberius and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. The {{remaining}} books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the Histories. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan, and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the Roman Empire, with which he had planned to finish his work. The Annals is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention Christ, which Tacitus does in connection with Nero's persecution of the Christians.|$|E

500|$|Columbian and woolly mammoths both {{disappeared}} {{during the}} late Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna. The most recent Columbian mammoth remains have been dated around 10,900 years ago. This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> these extinctions happened abruptly or were drawn out. During this period, 40 mammal species disappeared from North America, almost all of which weighed over the extinction of the mammoths cannot be explained in isolation.|$|E
500|$|Jesus {{taught that}} an apocalyptic figure, the [...] "Son of Man", would soon come on clouds of glory {{to gather the}} elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24–27, Matthew 24:29–31, Luke 21:25–28). He {{referred}} to himself as a [...] "son of man" [...] in the colloquial sense of [...] "a person", but scholars <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> he also meant himself when {{he referred to the}} heavenly [...] "Son of Man".

500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> I will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, {{on the condition that}} she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E
500|$|In June 1862, Darwin welcomed {{favourable}} {{reviews in}} the press and wrote to Hooker; [...] "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E
