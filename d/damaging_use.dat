50|$|Teak is {{also used}} {{extensively}} in boat decks, as it is extremely durable and requires very little maintenance. The teak tends to wear in to the softer 'summer' growth bands first, forming a natural 'non-slip' surface. Any sanding is therefore only <b>damaging.</b> <b>Use</b> of modern cleaning compounds, oils or preservatives will shorten {{the life of the}} teak, as it contains natural teak-oil a very small distance below the white surface. Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water, and re-caulk when needed. This cleans the deck, and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking. The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture, and prevents any mildew and algal growth. Over-maintenance, such as cleaning teak with harsh chemicals, can shorten its usable lifespan as decking.|$|E
40|$|Addictive {{substances}} (or drugs), {{which include}} substances as methamphetamine, heroin, alcohol but also drugs as analgesics, are in today's society often abused. Drug use may remain in occasional, not <b>damaging</b> <b>use.</b> However, the occasional use can develop through several stages to the dependence (or dependence syndrome). This {{happens if the}} individual is {{no longer able to}} be without this substance {{and in the case of}} lack of this substance, withdrawal symptoms can occure. As a consequence of the development of substance abuse, interconnected network of services for addiction treatment (ie secondary prevention) was formed. This includes also the therapeutic community. Therapeutic community is a residential service. This means that clients live here. Everyday program is clearly structured. Everyone without exception have to observe regime and rules. In the case of their violation there is a risk of penalty. The program contains several kinds of activities such as group therapy, community meetings, individual sports, art therapy, etc. All activities and the whole community has a positive therapeutic effect on the healing process. The investigation in this thesis has brought interesting findings from the clients of therapeutic community, their drug career and treatment. Clients filled out a questionnaire [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a highly}} {{digitized}} era, people can hardly live without {{computers and the}} Internet. While we are admiring the conveniences and advantages brought by the Internet, there is growing concern about problematic Internet use and whether {{this can lead to}} an addiction. In psychological field, the concept “Internet addiction ” has been used to explain uncontrollable and <b>damaging</b> <b>use</b> of the Internet. As reviewed from some literatures, the problem of Internet addiction is widespread among local students and is expected to be deteriorating. Although some researchers have investigated such issue in Hong Kong, very few of them have concentrated on finding out the predictors of Internet addiction. Therefore, the focus of current study is to identify any predictors of Internet addiction, intending to explain the addictive behavior of Internet users. Four hundred and ten data samples were collected through questionnaires from undergraduates of eight local universities. Using Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT), 18 % of the respondents were identified as excessive Internet users, showing the prevalence of Internet addiction among undergraduates in Hong Kong. Data collected were analyzed using Chi-square, correlation and multiple regression. Results of statistical analyses show that academic performance is the most important predictor o...|$|E

40|$|Tropical wildlands {{and their}} {{biodiversity}} will survive in perpetuity only through their integration into human society. One protocol for integration is to explicitly recognize conserved tropical wildlands as wildland gardens. A major way {{to facilitate the}} generation {{of goods and services}} by a wildland garden is to generate a public-domain Yellow Pages for its organisms. Such a Yellow Pages {{is part and parcel of}} high-quality search-and-delivery from wildland gardens. And, as they and their organisms become better understood, they become higher quality biodiversity storage devices than are large freezers. One obstacle to wildland garden survival is that specific goods and services, such as biodiversity prospecting, lack development protocols that automatically shunt the profits back to the source. Other obstacles are that environmental services contracts have the unappealing trait of asking for the payment of environmental credit card bills and implying delegation of centralized governmental authority to decentralized social structures. Many of the potential conflicts associated with wildland gardens may be reduced by recognizing two sets of social rules for perpetuating biodiversity and ecosystems, one set for the wildland garden and one set for the agroscape. In the former, maintaining wildland biodiversity and ecosystem survival in perpetuity through minimally <b>damaging</b> <b>use</b> is paramount, while in the agroscape, wild biodiversity and ecosystems are tools for a healthy and productive agroecosystem, and the loss of much of the original is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative {{cerebral}} microembolism is a {{cause of}} cerebral dysfunction after cardiac surgery, and particulate microemboli are the most damaging. Using a new-generation transcranial Doppler ultrasound, we compared the number and nature of microemboli in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during performance of proximal anastomoses with three techniques: an aortic side-biting clamp and two clampless devices (the Enclose II device [Novare Surgical Systems, Inc, Cupertino, Calif] and the Heartstring II device [Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif]) developed to obviate {{the need for an}} aortic side-biting clamp, thereby reducing the number of cerebral microemboli. METHODS: Bilateral continuous monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed with a multirange, multifrequency transcranial Doppler device that both automatically rejects artifacts online and discriminates between solid and gaseous microemboli. Recordings were continuously undertaken during performance of 66 proximal aortic anastomoses in 42 patients. Thirty-five anastomoses were performed with an aortic side-biting clamp, 20 with the Enclose device, and 11 the Hearstring device. RESULTS: Most microemboli occurred during application/insertion and removal of each device from the ascending aorta. The median number (interquartile range) of total microemboli was 11 (6 - 32) during side clamping, 11 (6 - 15) with the Enclose device, 40 (31 - 48) with the Heartstring device (P <. 01). The proportion of solid microemboli was significantly higher in the side-clamp group (23 %) compared with 6 % and 1 % in the Enclose and Heartstring groups, respectively (P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of aortic side clamping results in a significant reduction in the proportion of solid microemboli detected with transcranial Doppler. As solid microemboli are probably the most <b>damaging,</b> <b>use</b> of the Enclose and Heartstring devices may represent an important strategy for minimizing cerebral injury during proximal aortic anastomoses...|$|E

30|$|Modal-based damage-detection {{algorithms}} {{were used}} to identify the location of defects commonly found in timber and to estimate their severities. In this study, the authors propose modifications to an existing damage-detection algorithm for locating and evaluating damage by comparing the modal strain energy before and after <b>damage</b> <b>using</b> the first two flexural modes of vibration. Experimental verification was performed on pin-pin supported timber beams by employing the algorithms with extracted modal parameters using experimental modal analysis. Single and multiple cases of <b>damage</b> <b>used</b> to simulate pocket(s) of rot with various severities were inflicted by removing sections of timber beam specimens. The proposed damage indicator, computed from the first two flexural modes, was capable of detecting all damage locations. It was also able to estimate, with reasonable accuracy, the severity of damage in term of loss of sectional moment of inertia. The modified damage index method is generally reliable in detecting the location and estimating the severity of simulated defects in timber beams.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{model for}} {{composite}} beam with embedded de-lamination is developed using the wavelet based spectral finite element (WSFE) method particularly for <b>damage</b> detection <b>using</b> wave propagation analysis. The simulated responses are used as surrogate experimental results for the inverse problem of detection of <b>damage</b> <b>using</b> wavelet filtering. The WSFE technique {{is very similar to}} the fast fourier transform (FFT) based spectral finite element (FSFE) except that it uses compactly supported Daubechies scaling function approximation in time. Unlike FSFE formulation with periodicity assumption, the wavelet-based method allows imposition of initial values and thus is free from wrap around problems. This helps in analysis of finite length undamped structures, where the FSFE method fails to simulate accurate response. First, numerical experiments are performed to study the effect of de-lamination on the wave propagation characteristics. The responses are simulated for different de-lamination configurations for both broad-band and narrow-band excitations. Next, simulated responses are <b>used</b> for <b>damage</b> detection <b>using</b> wavelet analysis...|$|R
40|$|Need for {{developing}} efficient non-destructive damage detection procedures for civil engineering structures is growing rapidly. This paper presents a methodology for detection and quantification of structural <b>damage</b> <b>using</b> modal information obtained from transfer matrix technique. Vibration characteristics of beam-like structure have been determined using {{the computer program}} developed based on the formulations presented in the paper. It has been noted from reported literature that detection and quantification of <b>damage</b> <b>using</b> mode shape information is difficult and further, extraction of mode shape information has practical difficulties and limitations. Hence, a methodology for detection and quantification of <b>damage</b> in structure <b>using</b> tranfer matrix technique based on {{the changes in the}} natural frequencies has been developed. With an assumption of damage at a particular segment of the beam-like structure, an iterative procedure has been formulated to converge the calculated and measured frequencies by adjusting flexural rigidity of elements and then, the intersections are used for detection and quantification of damage. Eventhough the developed methodology is iterative, computational effort is reduced considerably by using transfer matrix technique. It is observed that the methodology is capable of predicting the location and magnitude of damage quite accurately...|$|R
