By May 1945, Belfast mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control. <b>Her</b> <b>empty</b> hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.|$|E

500|$|While Koiwai works, Yotsuba plays {{house with}} her wooden blocks, then talks her father into a game of hide and seek and playing on the swings in the park. Inspired by a picture book, Yotsuba learns how to cook pancakes from her father, with {{assistance}} from Yanda. That evening, the Koiwais show Jumbo photographs from the hot air balloon festival. While her father finishes an assignment, Jumbo babysits Yotsuba and gives her a book about animals. The next day, Jumbo takes the Koiwais shopping for a digital camera. While the adults compare cameras, Yotsuba explores the electronics store with Fuka. When Yotsuba lies about breaking some dishes, Koiwai takes her to a guardian Niō statue at a Buddhist temple to scare the [...] "lying bug" [...] out of her. When Yotsuba and Ena visit Miura's apartment, Yotsuba is upset when she sees <b>her</b> <b>empty</b> cardboard robot costume. To reassure her that the robot is not dead, Miura puts the costume on and plays {{with her in the}} park.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat {{in a coffee shop}} one grey day, wondering what to do with <b>her</b> <b>empty,</b> aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" [...] This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as [...] "truth" [...] onto the web.|$|E

2500|$|The Patterson Mansion was {{the home}} of President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace Coolidge in 1927. The White House needed {{extensive}} renovation which rendered it unliveable while construction occurred. [...] In February 1927, Cissy Patterson offered them the use of <b>her</b> <b>empty</b> home. The Coolidges stayed in the house from March 4, 1927, to June 13, 1927, after which they left for an extended vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Mrs. Coolidge found the rooms, which slanted slightly due to the odd shape of the lot, cramped. She felt the house was far better designed {{when it came to}} entertaining.|$|E
2500|$|Jones had {{originally}} planned {{to return to}} England {{as soon as the}} Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, and he realized that he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor [...] "till he saw his men began to recover." [...] The Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620–21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, <b>her</b> <b>empty</b> hold ballasted with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, {{and more than a dozen}} sailors.|$|E

Mary Eunice revels in the Christian persecution part of the movie, while Shelley, Lana, Grace, and Kit sneak out to begin their escape.

2500|$|Dumbledore {{was first}} to mention the room, noting that he {{discovered}} it at five-thirty in the morning, filled with chamber pots {{when he was trying}} to find a toilet. However, Dumbledore did not appear to know the Room's secrets. Dobby later told Harry of the Room in detail and admitted to frequently bringing Winky to the room to cure her bouts of Butterbeer-induced drunkenness, finding it full of antidotes and a [...] "nice elf-sized bed." [...] Filch was said to find cleaning supplies here when he had run out; when Fred and George needed a place to hide, it would appear as a broom cupboard. Trelawney also makes a habit of using it to hide <b>her</b> <b>empty</b> sherry bottles after she is sacked in Order of the Phoenix. It would seem that when one wishes to hide something it produces the same room for everyone: the Room of Hidden Things, which is full of many centuries worth of abandoned objects, such as broken furniture, books, and in one case a dead quintaped (for more information see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), which were presumably forgotten by their owners.|$|E

50|$|In the Dresden Codex, goddess O {{occurs in}} almanacs {{dedicated}} to the rain deities or Chaacs and is stereotypically inverting a water jar. On the famous page 74 originally preceding the New Year pages, <b>her</b> <b>emptying</b> of the water jar replicates the vomiting of water by a celestial dragon. Although this scene is usually understood as the Flood bringing about the world's and the year's end, it might also represent the dramatic onset of the rainy season. The image of the jar filled with rain water may derive from the sac holding the amniotic liquid; turning the jar would then be equivalent to birthgiving.|$|R
