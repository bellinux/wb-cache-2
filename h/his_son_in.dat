When the grown-up Devadasu returns to the village after finishing his education, his childhood friendship with Parvati turns into love.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> the last pursuit, {{taking him to}} meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject {{to the extent that he}} constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, describing it as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E

5|$|By 1675 George's eldest {{uncle had}} died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass {{to their own}} sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unrelenting {{losses and}} stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 {{he called on}} his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him. Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of Crete, Cyprus, as well as making his son Ibrahim Pasha, Pasha of the Peloponnese. After his offer was accepted, Ali sent <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of {{political}} rivalries which had caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son Panos was killed, and his nephew Nikitaras forced to flee.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{continued}} to publish his newsletter, The Liberty Bell, and sold his books as his health and eyesight {{continued to}} fail. On February 11, 1936, {{he died at}} Monte Ne due to peritonitis after an attack of intestinal influenza. The tomb made to house <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> 1903 was blasted open, and Harvey's simple cheap pine casket {{and that of his}} son were placed in a glass casket filled with copies of Harvey's books and some of his other papers. The tomb was then resealed. A small funeral was held on February 14, and a small plaque bearing the names and dates of the two Harveys was posted.|$|E
5|$|In 967, Adud al-Dawla took {{advantage}} of the quarrel between the Ilyasid ruler Muhammad ibn Ilyas and <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> Kerman to annex the province to his domain. Mu'izz al-Dawla had already attempted to conquer the province but was defeated by the Ilyasids. Adud al-Dawla conquered all of Kerman, and appointed his son Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris as the viceroy of the province, while a Daylamite officer named Kurkir ibn Justan was appointed as the chief captain of the army of Kerman.|$|E

5|$|LeDuc {{had many}} {{problems}} with diabetes {{toward the end}} of his life. While visiting <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta, Georgia, LeDuc slipped in the shower. As a result of the injuries, he developed an infection that ultimately led to his death. He died of a lung infection on May 1, 1999 in Atlanta. After his death, the revelation that he and Paul LeDuc were not related caused a minor scandal on talk shows in Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{advances}} {{into the}} Balkans were aided by further Byzantine civil conflict — this time between John V Palaeologus and {{his eldest son}} Andronicus IV. With Ottoman aid from Murad I, John V was able to blind Andronikus IV and his son John VII Palaeologus in September 1373. Andronicus escaped with his son and secured Murad's aid by promising a higher tribute than John V's. The civil strife continued as late as September 1390 though potential for conflict continued until 1408. John V eventually forgave Andronicus IV and <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> 1381, angering his second son and heir apparent, Manuel II Palaeologus. He seized Thessalonika, alarming the Ottoman Sultan in liberating parts of Greece from Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|Philip and {{his army}} joined <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after {{stubborn}} resistance from its Theban garrison. They {{went on to}} occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on {{the request of the}} Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.|$|E

5|$|Sadler {{was born}} June 24, 1875, in Spencer, Indiana, to Samuel Cavins Sadler and Sarah Isabelle Wilson. Of English and Irish descent, {{he was raised}} in Wabash, Indiana. Samuel did not enroll <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> public schools. Despite his lack of formal education, Sadler read many books about history as a child and became a skilled public speaker at a young age. Samuel was a convert to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and William was baptized into the {{denomination}} in 1888 and became devoutly religious.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the film incited Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of {{historical}} films such as Draupadi Vastrapaharanam (1918), Lava Kusa (1919), Shiva Leela (1919), Rukmini Satyabhama (1922) and Mahi Ravana (1923). In 1923, the death of <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> a fire which also burned his entire studio led Nataraja Mudaliar to retire from filmmaking. Nataraja Mudaliar is widely recognised {{as the father of}} Tamil cinema and his films helped in laying the foundation for the South Indian cinema industry. Nataraja Mudaliar's work inspired Raghupathi Surya Prakasa, whose father Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was later acknowledged as the father of Telugu cinema, and J. C. Daniel, who was later recognised as the father of Malayalam cinema.|$|E
5|$|Tracy's first post-MGM {{appearance}} was in The Mountain (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> Broken Lance). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and {{he threatened to}} leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). He again had to be convinced {{to stay with the}} film which met with a weak response.|$|E

5|$|Vikings {{then used}} the islands {{as a base}} for pirate expeditions to Norway and the coasts of {{mainland}} Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre ("Harald Fair Hair") annexed the Northern Isles (comprising Orkney and Shetland) in 875. Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|Both Orkney and Shetland saw a {{significant}} influx of Norwegian settlers {{during the late}} 8th and early 9th centuries. Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre) annexed the Northern Isles, comprising Orkney and Shetland, in 875. (It is clear that this story, which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga, {{is based on the}} later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be apocryphal.) Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>in</b> battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E
