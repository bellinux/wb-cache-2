Bystander effects following high and low LET radiation exposure are accepted but mechanisms are still not understood. There is some evidence for a physical component to the signal. This paper tests the hypothesis that bioelectric or biomagnetic phenomena are involved. Human immortalized skin keratinocytes and primary explants of mouse bladder and fish skin, were exposed <b>directly</b> to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> or treated {{in a variety of}} bystander protocols. Exposure of cells was conducted by shielding one group of flasks using lead, to reduce the dose below the threshold of 2 mGy 60 Cobalt gamma rays established for the bystander effect. The endpoint for the bystander effect in the reporter system used was reduction in cloning efficiency (RCE). The magnitude of the RCE was similar in shielded and unshielded flasks. When cells were placed in a Faraday cage the magnitude of the RCE was less but not eliminated. The results suggest that liquid media or cellcell contact transmission of bystander factors may be only part of the bystander mechanism. Bioelectric or bio magnetic fields may have a role to play. To test this further, cells were placed in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine for 10 min using a typical head scan protocol. This treatment also induced a bystander response. Apart from the obvious clinical relevance, the MRI results further suggest that bystander effects may be produced by non-ionizing exposures.

40|$|The cosmic reionization {{represents}} a fundamental yet poorly understood phase transition {{in the evolution}} of our universe. The most promising theory is that the <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> from young hot stars in star-forming galaxies drove reionization, but much information about the number of galaxies and the escape fraction of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> from galaxies is still missing. In this thesis, I discuss a technique for estimating the escape fraction of hydrogen <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> from galaxies in the reionization epoch. The method utilizes the power law slope of the UV continuum and the equivalent width of the Balmer beta emission line to try to estimate the escape fraction of a galaxy from its spectrum without ever <b>directly</b> observing any <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> The technique is applied to simulated galaxies from large scale cosmological simulations. I find that the method works for estimates of the escape fraction of dust free simulated galaxies. It is possible to distinguish between galaxies with escape fractions 0. 0, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 9 when no dust is added to the galaxies. I also show that the method works regardless of choice of numerical assumptions and assumptions about stellar evolution in the models. Lastly, I show that the addition of dust to the galaxies can introduce an ambiguity to the estimated escape fraction, and that this may reduce the estimation into just being between high or low escape fractions. The results also show that equivalent widths of the Balmer beta emission line larger than approximately 100 Ångströms are seen only in galaxies with escape fractions consistent with zero. The addition of dust and its effect on the spectral features used in the technique allows for an estimation of the average dust content. I find that the galaxies contain low amounts of dust, with a highest average dust attenuation in the visual of A= 0. 4 - 0. 6 magnitudes...|$|R

(2) Using <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> in combination with NPs and/or reductant (MeOH) has some limitations such as produced sludge and unknown byproducts. Major part of produced sludge is radiocatalyst particle, thus separation of catalyst particles from the treated effluent is necessary and coupling of the radiocatalysis with membrane technology seems hopeful [41]. In addition, the use of TiO 2 thin films rather than suspended form (particle) could be proposed for investigation in future studies. So that, thin film application obviously overcomes the disadvantage of separate catalyst from liquid at the end of the experimental period [36]. Unknown byproducts especially at low absorbed dose are likely to be raised as an environmental concern and strongly required to be further explored by pulse radiolysis and other modern analytical techniques including liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, ion chromatography, etc. (3) From other metal ions removal standpoint, which have physicochemical properties different from those of Cu 2 + and Cd 2 + ions, it could be mentioned that the potential removal ability varies from one metal ion to another and is related to many factors, such as reductive potential, hydrated ionic radius and hydration energy of the metals.

Computed tomography can more accurately identify subchondral fractures than MR imaging and thus remains important for staging. In congenital dysplasia of the hip, the position of the nonossified femoral head in children less than six months of age can only be inferred by indirect signs on CT.

40|$|Aim: We aim {{to measure}} the LyC signal from a sample of sources in the Chandra deep field south. We collect star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) with {{accurate}} spectroscopic redshifts, for which Hubble Space Telescope (HST) coverage and multi-wavelength photometry are available. Method: We selected a sample of about 200 sources at z~ 3. Taking advantage of HST resolution, we applied a careful cleaning procedure and rejected sources showing nearby clumps with different colours, which could be lower-z interlopers. Our clean sample consisted of 86 SFGs (including 19 narrow-band selected Lya emitters) and 8 AGN (including 6 detected in X-rays). We measured the LyC flux from aperture photometry in four narrow-band filters covering wavelengths below a 912 A rest frame (3. 11 <z< 3. 53). We estimated the ratio between ionizing (LyC flux) and 1400 A non-ionizing emissions for AGN and galaxies. Results: By running population synthesis models, we assume an average intrinsic L(1400 A) /L(900 A) ratio of 5 as the representative value for our sample. With this value and an average treatment of the lines {{of sight of the}} inter-galactic medium, we estimate the LyC escape fraction relative to the intrinsic value (fesc_rel(LyC)). We do not <b>directly</b> detect <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> from any individual SFG, but we are able to set a 1 (2) sigma upper limit of fesc_rel(LyC) < 12 (24) %. This result is consistent with other non-detections published in the literature. No meaningful limits can be calculated for the sub-sample of Lya emitters. We obtain one significant direct detection for an AGN at z= 3. 46, with fesc_rel(LyC) = (72 +/- 18) %. Conclusions: Our upper limit on fescrel(LyC) implies that the SFGs studied here do not present either the physical properties or the geometric conditions suitable for efficient LyC-photon escape.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{procedures for}} the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assay usually involve a lysis step at temperatures as high as 508 C. During this warm-lysis procedure, multiply damaged sites containing heat-labile sites (HLS) can be converted into double-strand breaks (DSB). Once formed, these DSB cannot be distinguished from the DSB formed <b>directly</b> by <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> This paper develops a method to correct DSB estimates {{for the effects of}} HLS in warm-lysis protocols. A first-order repair model is used to predict the number of HLS available for conversion into DSB {{as a function of the}} time available for repair before initiating warm-lysis. A mathematical expression is derived to separate prompt DSB from those formed through the artefactual conversion of HLS into DSB. The proposed formalism only requires the specification of two adjustable parameters, both of which can be estimated from measured data. Estimates of prompt DSB yields obtained by correcting warm-lysis data are in good agreement with estimates obtained using cold-lysis protocols, which do not include the effect of HLS. The retrospective analyses of two published datasets suggest that corrections for HLS have a substantial impact on DSB yields within the first 20 – 30 min after irradiation. Bi-exponential fits to the DSB data for Chinese hamster ovary cells suggest that corrections for HLS reduce the half-time for fast DSB rejoining by about 15 %, whereas the half-time for the slow DSB rejoining only decreases by 4 %. The total DSB yield and the fraction of fast-rejoining DSB decrease by 24 and 38 %, respectively, when the correction is applied. The proposed formalism can be used to characterize trends and uncertainties in DSB rejoining kinetics associated with the artefactual conversion of HLS into DSB. The retrospective application of the methodology to warm-lysis data enhances their relevance and usefulness for studies of DSB rejoining kinetics...|$|R
