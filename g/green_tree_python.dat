50|$|Despite this {{a flourishing}} illegal trade continues, {{and it became}} {{apparent}} that wildlife breeding farms were serving as conduits to funnel wild-caught <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> out of Indonesia. Investigation in the provinces of Maluku, West Papua and Papua from 2009 to 2011 revealed that 80% of <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> exported were caught in the wild, and estimate of around 5337 individuals a year. Harvesting of wild <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> was heaviest in Biak and neighbouring islands, with resulting population decline.|$|R
50|$|Daintree Rainforest is {{an exhibit}} of animals which live in {{tropical}} climates. Animals include cassowaries, red-legged pademelons, <b>tree</b> frogs, <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> and a scrub python.|$|R
50|$|An indoor exhibit {{that houses}} several {{different}} types of smaller, exotic animals. These include Pygmy marmosets, leafcutter ants, praying mantises, Lake Malawi cichlids, salmon-pink bird-eating spiders, locusts, Burmese pythons, plumed basilisks, veiled chameleons, <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons,</b> and poison dart frogs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia viridis) is {{a species}} of python native to New Guinea, islands in Indonesia, and Cape York Peninsula in Australia. Described by Hermann Schlegel in 1872, it was known for many years as Chondropython viridis. As its name suggests, it is a bright green snake that can reach 2 metres in length and 1.6 kg in weight, with females {{slightly}} larger and heavier than males. Living generally in trees, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> mainly hunts and eats small reptiles and mammals. It is a popular pet and numbers in the wild have suffered with large-scale smuggling of wild-caught green tree pythons in Indonesia. Despite this, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> is rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|German naturalist Hermann Schlegel {{described}} the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> in 1872 as Python viridis, from two specimens {{collected in the}} Aru Islands of Indonesia. His countryman Adolf Bernhard Meyer erected the genus Chondropython (though recognised similarity to Morelia) and {{described the}} <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> as Chondropython azureus in 1874, from a specimen collected in [...] "Kordo", later determined to be Korido on Biak Island. This was destroyed in World War II. French naturalist Henri Émile Sauvage described Chondropython pulcher from a specimen from Mansinam Island, Irian Jaya.|$|E
50|$|Exhibits include North and South American, Asian, African, and Australian {{animals such as}} agouti, emu, <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python,</b> kangaroo, lemur, lion, white lion, meerkats, owls, sloth bear, and Amur leopard.|$|E
2500|$|The zoo's reptile and {{amphibian}} house exhibits seventy {{species of}} reptiles and amphibians. These include [...] Aldabra tortoises, radiated tortoises, spider tortoises, Cuban crocodiles, a Gharial, a Philippine crocodile, Eastern indigo snakes, Gaboon vipers, gila monsters, green anacondas, [...] Burmese rock <b>pythons,</b> <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons,</b> Timor pythons, king cobras, northern copperheads, Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, hellbenders, [...] eastern red-backed salamanders, [...] long-tailed salamanders, Alligator snapping turtles and many more.|$|R
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{experiments}} to test pitohui batrachotoxins on potential predators. They {{have been shown to}} irritate the buccal membranes of brown <b>tree</b> snakes and <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons,</b> both of which are avian predators in New Guinea. The unpalatability of the species is also known to local hunters, which otherwise hunt songbirds of the same size.|$|R

50|$|For many years, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> was {{classified}} as the only species of the genus Chondropython, with the binomial name C. viridis. In 1993, Professor Arnold G. Kluge published a detailed phylogenetic analysis that found that the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> was nested within the genus Morelia and most {{closely related to the}} rough-scaled python (M. carinata). Hence became Morelia viridis. Two studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA published in 2013 and 2014 came up with differing results, one confirming the species in Morelia, the other placing it as an early offshoot with the Children's python genus Antaresia. This latter result was thought anomalous by later researchers.|$|E
50|$|C. caninus appears {{very similar}} to the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia viridis) from {{southeast}} Asia and Australia. Only very distantly related, {{this is an example of}} convergent evolution. Physical differences include the head scalation and the location of the heat pits around the mouth.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> {{was rated}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range and {{isolated}} declines in population from smuggling. However, the threat from smuggling for the pet trade was recognised and requires monitoring.|$|E

5000|$|Adults grow {{to about}} 6 feet (1.8 m) in length. They have highly {{developed}} front teeth {{that are likely}} proportionately larger than those of any other non-venomous snake. The color pattern typically consists of an emerald green ground color with a white irregular interrupted zigzag stripe or so-called 'lightning bolts' down the back and a yellow belly. The bright coloration and markings are very distinctive among South American snakes. Juveniles vary in color between various shades {{of light and dark}} orange or brick-red before ontogenetic coloration sets in and the animals turn emerald green (after 9-12 months of age). This also occurs in <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia viridis), a python species in which hatchlings and juveniles may also be canary yellow or brick-red. As opposed to popular belief, yellow juveniles (as in the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python)</b> do not occur in the emerald tree boa.|$|E
5000|$|Kofiau is {{an island}} in the Raja Ampat Islands, in West Papua, Indonesia. The island is {{primarily}} raised coral limestone with some volcanic hills, covered in low forest. The island is home to the endemic Kofiau paradise kingfisher and Kofiau monarch. A new form of the <b>Green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> has been found on Kofiau and Boo Island that retains its yellow color during growth.|$|E

50|$|The rain forest-covered Biak Islands {{have been}} {{designated}} the Biak-Numfoor rain forests, especially {{as they have}} {{the largest number of}} endemic bird species of any single area in the New Guinea region. There are also numerous reptile and amphibian species found here. Among the many snake species catalogued by Tom Mendelson during his herpetological survey of Biak in the 1990s, the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia viridis) and the amethystine python (Morelia amethystina) were quite common.|$|E
40|$|In 2014 we {{observed}} a noticeable increase in sudden deaths of <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> (Morelia 28 viridis). Pathological examination revealed accumulation of mucoid material within airways and lung, associated with {{enlargement of the}} entire lung. We performed full necropsy and histological examination on affected <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons</b> from different breeders to characterise the pathogenesis of this “mucinous” pneumonia. By histology we could show a marked hyperplasia of the airway epithelium and of faveolar type II pneumocytes. Since routine microbiological tests failed to identify a causative agent, we studied lung samples of a few diseased snakes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). From the NGS data we could assemble a piece of RNA genome < 85 % identical to nidoviruses previously identified in ball pythons and Indian pythons. We then employed RT-PCR to demonstrate {{the presence of the}} novel nidovirus in all diseased snakes. To attempt virus isolation, we established primary cell cultures of Morelia viridis liver and brain, which we inoculated with lung homogenates of infected individuals. Ultrastructural examination of concentrated cell culture supernatants showed the presence of nidovirus particles, and subsequent NGS analysis yielded the full genome of the novel virus, Morelia viridis nidovirus (MVNV). We then generated an antibody against MVNV nucleoprotein, which we used alongside RNA in situ hybridisation to demonstrate viral antigen and RNA in the affected lungs. This suggests that in natural infection MVNV damages the respiratory tract epithelium which then results in epithelial hyperplasia, most likely as an exaggerated regenerative attempt in association with increased epithelial turnover...|$|R
50|$|The Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House is a 32,000 ft2 m2 indoor exhibit {{that opened}} in 1997 and houses small animals in two main areas: the Gallery and the Ecosystem. The Gallery begins with a large room ringed with terrariums exhibiting {{reptiles}} and amphibians like axolotls, <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>pythons,</b> poison dart frogs, and Sistrurus catenatus. The next part of the Gallery features dwarf mongooses, naked mole rats, straw-coloured fruit bats and other small mammals in and around a man-made baobab tree trunk.
