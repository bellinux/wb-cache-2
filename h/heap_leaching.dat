25|$|<b>Heap</b> <b>leaching</b> is an {{extraction}} {{process by which}} chemicals (usually sulfuric acid) are used to extract the economic element from ore which has been mined and placed in piles on the surface. <b>Heap</b> <b>leaching</b> is generally economically feasible only for oxide ore deposits. Oxidation of sulfide deposits occurs during the geological process called weathering. Therefore, oxide ore deposits are typically found close to the surface. If {{there are no other}} economic elements within the ore a mine might choose to extract the uranium using a leaching agent, usually a low molar sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} types of hard rock mining there are several methods of extraction. In 2012, the {{percentage}} of the mined uranium produced by each mining method was: in-situ leach (44.9 percent), underground mining (26.2 percent), open pit (19.9 percent), and <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> (1.7 percent). The remaining 7.3% was derived as a byproduct of mining for other minerals, and miscellaneous recovery.|$|E
500|$|Mining in {{and around}} Rhyolite after 1920 {{consisted}} mainly of working old tailings until a new mine opened in 1988 {{on the south side}} of Ladd Mountain. A company known as Bond Gold built an open-pit mine and mill at the site, about [...] south of Rhyolite along State Route 374. LAC Minerals acquired the mine from Bond in 1989 and established an underground mine there in 1991 after a new body of ore called the North Extension was discovered. Barrick Gold acquired LAC Minerals in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine until the end of 1998. The mine used a chemical extraction process known as vat leaching involving the use of a weak cyanide solution. The process, like <b>heap</b> <b>leaching,</b> makes it possible to process ore profitably that otherwise would not qualify as mill-grade. Over its entire life, the mine processed about [...] of ore and produced about [...] of gold.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{processes}} of biopassive detoxication are {{of special interest}} for the solution of environmental issues of detoxification of gold <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> cyanide-bearing wastes whose detoxification period is unlimited. These processes are based on spontaneous degradation of cyanides {{under the influence of}} natural factors including the action of autochthonous bacterial community. The purpose of the work is to develop a biopassive detoxification technology of <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> stockpiled wastes. Methods. A long-term experiment on ore mass storage under the conditions of <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> ore pile zoning has been carried out in order to model the process of passive detoxification of gold <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> stockpiled wastes. The content of toxic compounds in the ore mass has been determined using a chemical analysis based on standard procedures. Results. It is found that biochemical processes dominate over simple chemical oxidation during passive detoxification of the gold <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> ore pile. Approximating biodegradation equations have been calculated for the major toxic compounds (thiocyanates and cyanides including copper and nickel cyanide complexes). The technology of biopassive detoxification of <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> stockpiled wastes has been developed at an industrial <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> site of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) deposit. Water balance of the <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> installation and detoxification time for the major mass of the ore pile have been calculated. Process circuit and process flow diagram of the proposed technology have been developed. Conclusions. The introduced technology eliminates the costs for reagent detoxification and is based on high economic and environmental efficiency as compared to conventional chemical technology. Introduction of additional modernizations of the irrigation circuit as well as removal and transportation of snow will be carried out at low capital and operational costs. The expected economic potential of the technology of bipassive detoxification of gold <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> site will be 151429. 7 thousand rouble...|$|R

50|$|<b>Heap</b> <b>leaching</b> is an {{industrial}} mining process to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore via {{a series of}} chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and then re-separates them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the ore, whereas in situ mining lacks these liners and pulls pregnant solution up to obtain the minerals. Most mining companies, favor the economic feasibility of the <b>heap</b> <b>leaching,</b> considering that <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> is a better alternative to conventional processing (such as flotation, agitation, and vat leaching).|$|E

50|$|Once the ore is mined it can {{be treated}} as a whole ore using a dump {{leaching}} or <b>heap</b> <b>leaching</b> processes. This is typical of low-grade, oxide deposits. Normally, the ore is crushed and agglomerated prior to <b>heap</b> <b>leaching.</b> High grade ores and ores resistant to cyanide leaching at coarse particle sizes, require further processing in order to recover the gold values.

40|$|The typical {{conceptual}} {{approach to}} <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> closure planning assumes heaps will be rinsed to achieve water quality goals, followed by physical reclamation {{of the heap}} to meet revegetation goals. While rinsing is initially effective in reducing concentrations of some constituents, primarily cyanide, experience has shown {{that it may be}} very difficult to reach drinking water standards for all constituents. Also, the addition of fresh water to the system in order to achieve water quality goals increases the volume of <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> drain down that must be managed. Therefore, the use of rinsing must be closely evaluated considering the ultimate management of the solution during the “tail ” of the drain down curve. Effective closure will depend upon the volume and quality of the heap solution inventory; geochemical behavior of the spent ore; climate and other site conditions such as depth to groundwater, revegetation goals, and post-closure land use. In effect, there is no single “one size fits all ” closure approach for <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> pads; each <b>heap</b> requires an approach that considers site-specific factors. Depending on those site factors, {{there are a variety of}} tools that can be used to achieve closure. Revegetation measures (through direct seeding of the heap or placement of a soil cover) should be considered in light of their implications for solution management; in some cases, low-permeability covers or engineered storage/evaporation covers may be warranted. Evaporation, land application, and treatment present a range of methods to deal with heap solution drain down and residual drainage.

30|$|The {{land use}} pattern within the basin is primarily, farming (cocoa and food crops) and gold mining. Large acreages of virgin forest were removed and {{replaced}} with cocoa farms. In addition, food crops, such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, plantain, as well as fruits, such as banana; oranges etc, are produced together with cocoa for subsistence. Gold mining within the basin is of two types, “large-scale” and “small-scale” (“Galamsey”). “Large-scale” mining is conducted by <b>heap</b> <b>leach</b> technique or roasting of ore. Oxidised ores derived from sulphide principally arsenopyrites, realgar, orpiment, and pyrites in the weathered zones are <b>heap</b> <b>leached</b> by cyanidation (Kortatsi 2007). Paleoplacer (free milling ore) is mined from deep zones crushed, milled, and cyanided (Kortatsi 2007). “Small-scale” mining involves extracting gold from ochrosols soils mainly from stream floors by mercury amalgamation (Kortatsi 2007).|$|R
40|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{results on the}} secondary <b>leaching</b> of previously <b>heap</b> <b>leached</b> gold ore are presented.
