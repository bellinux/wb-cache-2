A patient performs shoulder exercises and goes through a series of massages to manipulate and strengthen the shoulder. It’s of great importance to maintain mobility; prolonged disuse of the shoulder may lead to muscular atrophy, which must be corrected before recovery is possible. Exercising an injured shoulder may be painful, but knowledgeable trainers will know which activities are likely to be helpful or harmful throughout a patient's recovery process.|$|E

The present study investigated the effect of chronic {{treatment with}} IGF-I on intrinsic myocyte function {{and the role of}} the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 -kinase-Akt-sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) 2 a signaling cascade in these responses. Myocytes were isolated from 23 adult rats and cultured with and without IGF-I (10 − 6 M). After 48 h of treatment, myocyte function was evaluated. IGF-I increased contractile function (percent contraction, 7. 7 ± 0. 3 % vs. 4. 5 ± 0. 3 %; P < 0. 01) and accelerated relaxation time (time for 70 % relengthening, 81 ± 4 vs. 106 ± 5 ms; P < 0. 05) compared with untreated myocytes [control (Con) ]. The <b>enhanced</b> <b>function</b> was associated with an increase in Ca 2 + transients assessed by fura- 2 (340 / 380 nm; IGF-I, 0. 42 ± 0. 02 vs. Con, 0. 25 ± 0. 01; P < 0. 01). The PI 3 -kinase inhibitor LY- 249002 (10 − 9 M) abolished the <b>enhanced</b> <b>function</b> caused by IGF-I. IGF-I increased both Akt and SERCA 2 a protein levels 2. 5 - and 4. 8 -fold, respectively, compared with those of Con (P < 0. 01); neither phospholamban nor calsequestrin was affected. To evaluate whether the SERCA 2 a protein was directly mediated by Akt-SERCA 2 a signaling, IGF-I-induced changes in the SERCA 2 a protein were compared in myocytes transfected with adenovirus harboring either constitutively active Akt [multiplicity of infection (MOI), 15] or dominant negative Akt (dnAkt; MOI, 15). The ability of IGF-I to upregulate the SERCA 2 a protein in myocytes transected with active Akt was absent in dnAkt myocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate that chronic treatment with IGF-I enhances intrinsic myocyte function and that this effect is due to an enhancement in intracellular Ca 2 + handling, secondary to the activation of the PI 3 -kinase-Akt-SERCA 2 a signaling cascade...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) may be a primary beta-cell antigen {{involved}} in the autoimmune response leading to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of osteoporosis {{has been increasing}} globally. Recently surgical indications for elderly patients with osteoporosis have been increasing.

Osteoporosis {{is a result of}} negative bone remodeling from <b>enhanced</b> <b>function</b> of the osteoclasts. Because bone formation is the result of coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, anti-resorptive agents that induce osteoclast apoptosis may not be effective in spinal fusion surgery, necessitating new bone formation.

The instrumentations and techniques with increased pullout strength may increase fusion rate through rigid fixation.
