Trading in the US began in the mid 19th century, when central grain markets were established and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (also called spot or cash market) or for <b>forward</b> <b>delivery.</b> These forward contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today's exchange-traded futures contracts. Although contract trading began with traditional commodities such as grains, meat and livestock, exchange trading has expanded to include metals, energy, currency and currency indexes, equities and equity indexes, government interest rates and private interest rates.|$|E

40|$|A bstract— In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{infrastructure}} important for proficient management of the network, namely the secondary markets for transmission rights. Following the re:;tructuring process {{the participants in the}} electric power industry are engaging in complex market ac-tivities to meet their electricity needs. Many market partici-pants enter into <b>forward</b> (<b>delivery)</b> contracts for energy. The forward price may be described as the spot market price for delivery of a commodity at a fixed time in the future. As a counterpart to the forward contract marketplace for energy, the secondary market for transmission provides the neces-sary mechanism for supporting the market activities so that the change in value is readily conveyed to all of the market participants of the forward contracts for transmission por-tion of electric services {{in the form of the}} intermediate term transmission contracts. Here the market participants may be the holders of the physical transmission rights, the hold-ers of the financial transmission rights and/or the bidders in the spot market. With the introduction of the secondnry markets for trans-mission rights we can compare the workings for the transmis-sion rights in the form of the intermediate term transmission contracts proposecl in this paper with the transmission con-gestion contracts (TCC) and the flowgate rights.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} form electrical conduits between adjacent myocardial cells, permitting rapid spatial {{passage of}} the excitation current essential to each heartbeat. Arrhythmogenic decreases in gap junction coupling are a characteristic of stressed, failing, and aging myocardium, but the mechanisms of decreased coupling are poorly understood. We previously found that microtubules bearing gap junction hemichannels (connexons) can deliver their cargo directly to adherens junctions. The specificity of this delivery requires the microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB 1. We performed this study to investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} oxidative stress that accompanies acute and chronic ischemic disease perturbs connexon forward trafficking. We found that EB 1 was displaced in ischemic human hearts, stressed mouse hearts, and isolated cells subjected to oxidative stress. As a result, we observed limited microtubule interaction with adherens junctions at intercalated discs and reduced connexon delivery and gap junction coupling. A point mutation within the tubulin-binding domain of EB 1 reproduced EB 1 displacement and diminished connexon delivery, confirming that EB 1 displacement can limit gap junction coupling. In zebrafish hearts, oxidative stress also reduced the membrane localization of connexin and slowed the spatial spread of excitation. We anticipate that protecting the microtubule-based <b>forward</b> <b>delivery</b> apparatus of connexons could improve cell-cell coupling and reduce ischemia-related cardiac arrhythmias...|$|E

40|$|The major {{economic}} policy {{issue of the}} 1980 s is inflation. Although economists have been writing about inflation for several decades, little {{work has been done}} on the theory of inflation measurement. There is an extensive literature dealing with the statistical aspects of price indices and the inflation phenomenon. However, statistical discussions ignore the economic theory behind inflation measures and inflation discussions fail to address the practical aspect of measurement of inflation. This dissertation develops an inflation measure that overcomes these failings. By combining the principles of price formation found in microeconomic literature with the macroeconomic theory of inflation, an economically appropriate measure of inflation is presented. The measure adopts the Marshallian view that producers fix prices and vary output in response to market conditions. Recognizing that production takes time which leads to uncertainty about the <b>forward</b> <b>delivery</b> market, the measure stresses both labor and material input costs as the prime price determinants. Contracts fix these costs. Current or spot market demand influences prices only in the service sector. This influence is measured and added to the price forming factors determined in oligopoly, monopoly and competitive sectors. The four sectors are combined with a measure of government price influence to generate the measure of inflation. A highly stylized model of this measure is tested monthly for the 1965 - 78 period. The theoretical measure and the model results are then compared to conventional inflation measures. The CPI, GNP deflator and WPI are discussed and their problems as measures of inflation are assessed. The measure proposed and tested here eliminates much of the sampling bias, substitution bias, and quality bias plaguing the others. Being designed as a measure of inflation in the general price level, the proposed measure actually incorporates the broad economic base necessary for a macroeconomic measure. It provides a useful policy guide for inflation management and an appropriate measure of the policy's success...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analytic approximation for the pricing dynamics of spark spread options {{in terms of}} Fourier transforms. We propose to model the spark spread, that is, the price di®erence of electricity and gas, directly using a mean-reverting model with di®usion and jumps. The model is analyzed empirically, and shown to ¯t observed data in the UK reasonably well. The main advantage with the model is that the spark spread of electricity and gas forwards, being <b>forwards</b> with <b>delivery</b> over pe-riods, can be priced analytically. The price dynamics for di®erent spark spread options with electricity and gas forwards as underlyings, is analytically derived through Fourier transforms.
