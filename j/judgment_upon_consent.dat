60|$|CHR. Therefore thou never hadst {{one good}} thought {{concerning}} thyself in thy life. But {{let me go}} on.

Avoid using unintelligibility {{as a means of}} evading the making of <b>judgments</b> <b>upon</b> society—and as a means of escaping your readers' <b>judgments</b> <b>upon</b> your own work.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{told that}} girl, in the kindest, gentlest way, that I could not <b>consent</b> to deliver <b>judgment</b> <b>upon</b> any one's manuscript, because an individual's verdict was worthless. It might underrate {{a work of}} high merit and lose it to the world, or it might overrate a trashy {{production}} and so open the way for its infliction upon the world: I said that the great public was the only tribunal competent to sit in <b>judgment</b> <b>upon</b> a literary effort, and therefore it must be best to lay it before that tribunal in the outset, since {{in the end it}} must stand or fall by that mighty court's decision anyway." ...|$|R
