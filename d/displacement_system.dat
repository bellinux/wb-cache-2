40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{displacement}} ventilation has been increasingly used in Scandinavia and Western Europe to improve indoor air quality and to save energy. By using a detailed computer simulation method, this study compared the energy consumption of a <b>displacement</b> ventilation <b>system</b> {{with that of a}} mixing ventilation system for three types of U. S. buildings: a small office, a classroom and an industrial workshop. The investigation covers five U. S. climatic regions and three different building zones. The study showed that a <b>displacement</b> ventilation <b>system</b> might use more fan energy and less chiller and boiler energy than a mixing ventilation system. The total energy consumption is slightly less with a <b>displacement</b> ventilation <b>system.</b> The <b>displacement</b> ventilation <b>system</b> requires a larger air-handling unit and a smaller chiller than the mixing ventilation system does. The first costs are lower for displacement ventilation if the system is applied in the core region of a building. In the perimeter zones, the <b>displacement</b> ventilation <b>system</b> needs a separate heating system, and the first costs are slightly higher. by ShiPing Hu. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|DNA strand <b>displacement</b> <b>systems</b> have {{transformative}} {{potential in}} synthetic biology. While powerful examples {{have been reported}} in DNA nanotechnology, such systems are plagued by leakage, which limits network stability, sensitivity, and scalability. An approach to mitigate leakage in DNA nanotechnology, which is applicable to synthetic biology, is to introduce mismatches to complementary fuel sequences at key locations. However, this method overlooks nuances in the secondary structure of the fuel and substrate that impact the leakage reaction kinetics in strand <b>displacement</b> <b>systems.</b> In an effort to quantify the impact of secondary structure on leakage, we introduce the concepts of availability and mutual availability and demonstrate their utility for network analysis. Our approach exposes vulnerable locations on the substrate and quantifies the secondary structure of fuel strands. Using these concepts, a 4 -fold reduction in leakage has been achieved. The result is a rational design process that efficiently suppresses leakage and provides new insight into dynamic nucleic acid networks...|$|R

Their increased thermal stability and selectivity toward their complements make them well-suited for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Although the structural and thermodynamic properties of LNA–LNA, LNA–RNA, and LNA–DNA hybridizations are known, the kinetic effects of incorporating LNA nucleotides into DNA strand <b>displacement</b> <b>systems</b> are not. Here, we thoroughly studied the strand displacement kinetics {{as a function}} of the number and position of LNA nucleotides in DNA oligonucleotides. When compared to that of an all-DNA control, with an identical sequence, the leakage rate constant was reduced more than 50 -fold, to an undetectable level, and the invasion rate was preserved for a hybrid DNA/LNA system. The total performance enhancement ratio also increased more than 70 -fold when calculating the ratio of the invading rate to the leakage rate constants for a hybrid system. The rational substitution of LNA nucleotides for DNA nucleotides preserves sequence space while improving the signal-to-noise ratio of strand <b>displacement</b> <b>systems.</b> Hybrid DNA/LNA systems offer great potential for high-performance chemical reaction networks that include catalyzed hairpin assemblies, hairpin chain reactions, motors, walkers, and seesaw gates...|$|R
