The Matisse painting shown in the Griffins' dining room is only animated similar to an actual Matisse painting due to a legal issue with the paintings.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, <b>the</b> number of <b>supermarkets</b> <b>in</b> South Africa has been {{steadily}} growing.

In this paper, we present {{a case study of}} two villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Transkei area of South Africa. In these poor rural communities, the majority of households now buy their main food items from supermarkets rather than from local shops and farmers. While presenting an important step towards livelihood development and food security, these supermarkets form also a strong competitor for local agricultural sales. <b>The</b> <b>supermarkets</b> provide many food items at lower prices. With an increase <b>in</b> income, <b>the</b> households look for variety and exotism in their food products, and will most likely find this <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarkets,</b> rather than <b>the</b> local stores. We argue therefore that development programs should focus on the local growers' access to <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> procurement system...|$|R
