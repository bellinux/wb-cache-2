5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E

5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to tell if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers.

5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E

To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment.

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E

5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>work</b> {{properly}} on Windows XP {{and later}} Windows platforms, {{as the game}} was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function properly but it may still crash when trying to rename a saved game.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{continued}} to publish novels set in China through 1887, writing five in this period.
