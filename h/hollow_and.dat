His absence was explained by a storyline injury sustained during a brawl with Kane on the November 24 episode of Raw is War.

5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.|$|E

NY43 continues through forested areas of Stephentown to Stephentown Center, denoted by a cluster of homes near the intersection of NY43 and Newton Road.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Abiotic {{environmental}} {{variables and}} inverte-brate assemblages were compared among four habitat types (bare hollow, sphagnum-rich <b>hollow,</b> pool, <b>and</b> mat edge) on a floating mat in Mizorogaike Pond, Kyoto. We found differences in abiotic environments between two <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> two inundated habitats (pool and mat edge); pH {{was significantly lower}} in hollow habitats than in inundated habitats, and water depths were significantly shallower in sphagnum-rich hollows than in inundated sites. The com-position of invertebrate assemblages in the hollow was distinct from that in the inundated habitats. The abun-dances of some dominant invertebrate taxa or functional feeding groups on the floating mat differed between the <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> inundated habitats, and were correlated with water temperature, pH and depth. These results indicate that habitat heterogeneity created by the coexistence of <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> inundated habitats contributes to species diversity on the floating mat in Mizorogaike Pond. A comparison of the pH values in different wetlands revealed that both bog- and fen-specific components coexist within this system. In order to adequately manage and conserve peatland ecosystems, {{it is necessary to}} consider the importance and vulnerability of both <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> inun-dated habitats in peatlands...|$|R
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E

5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E
5|$|Many of the stelae that K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I erected became prototypes for monuments {{raised by}} his successors. The first stela raised, Stela 25, is the king's inaugural monument, and it {{established}} the precedent for the niche style. This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hollows</b> <b>and</b> Rounds {{are similar}} to {{moulding}} planes, but lack a specific moulding profile. Instead, they cut either a simple concave or convex shape on the face or edge of a board to create a single element of a complex-profile moulding. They are used in pairs or sets of various sizes to create moulding profile elements such as fillets, coves, bullnoses, thumbnails ovolos, ogees, etc. When making mouldings, <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> rounds must be used together to create the several shapes of the profile. However, they {{may be used as}} a single plane to create a simple decorative cove or round-over {{on the edge of a}} board. Many of these <b>hollows</b> <b>and</b> rounds can be classified in the category of side-escapement planes.|$|R

The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was <b>hollow)</b> <b>and</b> had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E

5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E

The figurine is 30cm (11.81in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14cm (5.51in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is <b>hollow</b> <b>and</b> weighs 2.5kg (5.51lbs), {{for the first few}} years it was made of solid metal.
