25|$|Ashkenazi men show low Y-DNA {{diversity}} within each major haplogroup, meaning that {{compared to the}} size of the modern population, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> were once a relatively small number of men having children. This possibly results from a series of founder events and high rates of endogamy within Europe. Despite Ashkenazi Jews representing a recently founded population in Europe, founding effects suggest that they probably derived from a large and diverse ancestral source population in the Middle East, who may have been larger than the source population from which the indigenous Europeans derived.|$|E

On Sundays, Terce was sung in organum before the principal Mass, and included the hymn Nunc sancte nobis spiritus, which recalls the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. In the monastery of Lerins, work commenced after Terse and continued until Nones. The custom of Little Hours {{grew up in the}} monastic and larger Church {{in the course of the}} centuries and still is followed in stricter monasteries and hermitages.

25|$|Augustinians were {{expected}} to observe strict protocols in contacts with outsiders, to travel only with their abbot's permission and never to sleep alone. One of the problems at Lilleshall was that canons were often forced to undertake expeditions to the outlying estates, outside direct supervision of the abbot. This was much less prevalent at Haughmond, with its more concentrated estates, although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> was sometimes a need for canons to stay at Nefyn, {{where there was a}} canons' house in the early 14th century. There were also facilities, including chapels, for canons and abbots to stay on some of the granges, including Leebotwood and Beobridge. As the canons were all ordained priests, they could also officiate at chapels in the extra-parochial areas to the west, although secular clergy were appointed as soon as these communities became viable. Eyton traced in detail how the chapel at Knockin evolved, under the abbey's control, into a parish church with a vicar. In the early years there were lay brothers to help {{in the work of the}} abbey, but they are never mentioned after 1190. There were, however, numerous paid officials and servants on the premises.|$|E

Eighty prisoners from the train, including Pechersky, were selected for work in Lager II. The remaining 1,920 Jews were immediately led to the gas chambers. Pechersky later recalled his thoughts as the train pulled up to Sobibor, [...] "How many circles of hell were there in Dante's Inferno? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> were nine. How many have already passed? Being surrounded, being captured, camps in Vyazma, Smolensk, Borisov, Minsk... And finally I am here. What's next?"

500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.|$|E

500|$|Animal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics upon its release. The album holds a score 54 out of 100 based on 18 critical reviews, {{according to the}} music review aggregator Metacritic. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times stated that Kesha was [...] "offer a thoroughly fleshed-out character to embrace or despise," [...] comparing her persona to [...] "classic screwball blond" [...] such as Jean Harlow and Mae West, while praising her and Dr. Luke for [...] "refashion the screwball heroine role to suit {{a new era of}} aggressive superficiality and libertine self-empowerment". Her conclusion about Kesha and the album was that [...] "er total commitment to the deliberately stupid script Animal provides makes [...] work." [...] Ailbhe Malone of NME gave Animal a mixed review but concluded that [...] "eneath the patina of skeezy Freshers'-Week-LOLZ lyrics ('got a water-bottle full of whiskey in my handbag')" [...] <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> [...] "lies a talent." [...] Andrew Burgess of musicOMH was impressed with Kesha, calling her an [...] "auto-tuned talk-singing, gum-smacker" [...] that may well be [...] "a pop-genius, a gutter-glam Jonathan Swift." [...] He described the album as [...] "an infectiously good dance-pop album." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix thought that the album was [...] "a clear subversion of pop norms" [...] with [...] "effortless hooks".|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} was split. While the {{majority}} of reviewers were favorably impressed, some very much so, a significant minority were disappointed at the message the episode conveyed and the storytelling decisions. Among the former were Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic, who described it as [...] "Glee at its best: cartoonish, outlandish, and loud—but still oh-so true to life." [...] IGN's Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10, and called the main storyline [...] "comical and human". Candace Bulter of ScreenCrave also gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote, [...] "This week's Glee puts on the beer goggles to put alcohol-related issues in perspective. The result is humorous and ironic, but leaves something to be wanted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the underpinnings of the episode aren't terrible, just overstuffed" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "B−". MTV's Aly Semigran stated that the episode [...] "left something of a sour taste", and added that while the show [...] "always combines humor with serious life lessons, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> were none to be found here"; she called the episode [...] "a wasted opportunity". BuddyTV Jen Harper was also disenchanted by the episode, and concluded, [...] "Geez Louise, Glee. What's happened to you?" [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times saw the show's message differently from Semigran, and wrote, [...] "Leave it to Glee to tackle a potentially joyless, didactic topic like teenage drinking and somehow manage to entertain and surprise and get its important life lessons across." [...] Time Richard Corliss called it a [...] "breezy, sharply written episode" [...] and rated it in the [...] "high-middle range" [...] for the show. He concluded, [...] "Last night’s hour of Glee was of the level a superior series sticks in mid-season between its 'important' episodes. If this is coasting, take me along for the ride." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} is allied to the Buteo hawks, {{and it is}} {{sometimes}} included with these. Other authors place it in the monotypic genus Geranoaetus. Though the former {{seems to be more}} appropriate from a phylogenetic standpoint, the latter is still used here, as much more research into phylogeny and hybridization has to take place before the correct taxonomy of the buteonines can be resolved. It stands to note that the taxonomic and systematic dispute goes back to the early-mid 20th century already. However, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> is no real reason to suppose that the lineage of the black-chested buzzard-eagle is North American in origin; fossils that might have been its ancestors at first sight differ in details {{and are more likely to}} belong to other buteonine lineages. Because of its buteonine lineage, this species and the closely related Harpyhaliaetus are not considered [...] "true eagles", as are Aquila eagles and [...] "hawk-eagles", and are thus the largest extant type of the diverse buteonine lineage.|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>there</b> is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
