5|$|Feminist <b>jurisprudence</b> is {{a branch}} of <b>jurisprudence</b> that {{examines}} the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions {{about the history of}} legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.|$|E
5|$|According to Sunni <b>jurisprudence,</b> in the {{application}} of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of <b>jurisprudence,</b> nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni <b>jurisprudence.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, <b>jurisprudence</b> must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari <b>jurisprudence</b> uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of <b>jurisprudence</b> as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of <b>jurisprudence</b> between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of <b>jurisprudence</b> to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
5|$|However Saudi {{judges are}} {{expected}} to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of <b>jurisprudence</b> before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If {{the answer is not}} found in the six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the <b>jurisprudence</b> of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad.|$|E

5|$|TJ founder Ilyas preached that {{knowledge}} of virtues and A'amalu-Saliha (Good Deeds and Actions) {{takes precedence over}} the knowledge of Masa'il (<b>jurisprudence).</b> Knowing <b>jurisprudence</b> detail (Fara'id (mandates) and Sunan (traditions) of Salat) is useful only {{if a person is}} ready to perform rituals such as offering Salat.|$|E

5|$|Taunya Lovell Banks, Professor of Equality <b>Jurisprudence</b> at University of Maryland School of Law, saw Nannygate as {{also having}} a racial dimension, {{in that it}} {{illustrated}} how the professional class exploited domestic workers of color.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} <b>jurisprudence</b> primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality <b>jurisprudence.</b> The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{employed}} at the West Virginia State Capitol, White began studying <b>jurisprudence</b> with legal coursebooks. He undertook {{his study of}} <b>jurisprudence</b> in {{the law firm of}} Chilton, MacCorkle and Chilton in Charleston. White was admitted to the bar in 1897 and afterward established a law practice in Charleston. White's practice began arguing cases in county, state, and federal level courts within West Virginia. On December 19, 1901, the West Virginia Secretary of State office issued a charter authorizing $100,000 in capital stock for the incorporation of Midland Railway, of which White was a corporator with one subscribed share of $100.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from the federal bench shortly after his 65th birthday (and with nearly three decades of federal judicial service), Higginbotham joined the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, as well as accepted a position at Harvard University's John F.

5|$|At the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) in Jerusalem, Ahmad Pasha ibn Ridwan had a khalwa, {{known as}} the Mamluk Khalwa, built for local Sufis headed by al-Ghazi Abu al-Sa'ud, and {{for the study of}} Islamic <b>jurisprudence</b> in 1601. The {{architect}} of the khalwa was Abd al-Muhsin ibn Nimr, who worked Ahmad Pasha's other projects in Jerusalem. Ahmad Pasha established a waqf to fund Abu al-Sa'ud and the khalwa's upkeep and management.|$|E

White was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1854 and practiced law in Romney.|$|E
5|$|Feminist <b>jurisprudence</b> signifies a {{reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E
5|$|Flournoy {{received}} his primary education at Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia.

His childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of law, Justinian I's reforms had a clear effect on the {{evolution}} of <b>jurisprudence,</b> with his Corpus Juris Civilis becoming the basis for revived Roman law in the West, while Leo III's Ecloga influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slavic world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurisprudence</b> {{was taught}} in Latin, {{even in the}} law schools of the East, but {{toward the end of}} the fourth and the {{beginning}} of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut, which was the long-established lingua franca of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire. A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.|$|E

On August 14, 1772, he asked for permission to practice medicine in Quito, and it was granted on November 28, 1772. After that, no information exists about Espejo's whereabouts until 1778, when he wrote a somewhat polemical sermon.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus {{forms the}} basis of Latin <b>jurisprudence</b> (including ecclesiastical Canon Law) and, for historians, {{provides}} a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the leges (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, senatorial consults (senatusconsulta), imperial decrees, case law, and jurists' opinions and interpretations (responsa prudentum).|$|E
5|$|The Torah, {{although}} disallowing {{the use of}} most insects as food, {{permits the}} consumption of certain locusts; specifically, the red, the yellow, the spotted grey, and the white are considered permissible. In Islamic <b>jurisprudence,</b> eating locusts is considered halal. The Prophet Muhammad {{was reported to have}} eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and <b>jurisprudence</b> was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|White {{was sent}} by his father to Scotland to receive his education, where he studied <b>jurisprudence</b> at the University of Edinburgh.

Al-Qassam also followed the Hanafi fiqh (school of <b>jurisprudence)</b> of Sunni Islam and studied at the local Istambuli Mosque under the teaching of well-known ′alim (scholar) Sheikh Salim Tayarah.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} lawyer and court clerk, White conducted {{the teaching of}} <b>jurisprudence</b> in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P.

In the theatre, comedy, tragedy, mime and dance are covered. In the amphitheatre, Isidore covers those who fight with nets, nooses and other weapons.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic <b>jurisprudence</b> (or fiqh), {{each with its}} own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by the Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E
