40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the impact of firm performance and CEO power on CEO turnover. Research in CEO turnover literature found that corporate performance is frequently used as an indicator {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of CEO effort and findings from most of these studies indicate that the turnover rate of CEO is higher for poor performing firm when compared to well performing firms, furthermore, social network theory and human capital theory suggest that CEO gain their power from their educational background; skill and <b>functional</b> background; special <b>expertise</b> experience; industry specialization; prestige; ownership;age;and lenght of tenure. This power will entrench the CEO in the company, thus making the decision to fire the underperforming CEO more difficult. Our result show that firms with poor performance and older CEO are more likely to change their CEO. In contrast, CEo turnover is less likely to occur when firms exercise CEO/Chairman duality; have CEO who own a certain portion of company shares; and have CEO with longer tenure...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on ten case-studies of {{integration}} in van 2 ̆ 7 ous places in Australia undertaken in 2002.

The attempts to better integrate welfare work and congregational activities reflect a dissatisfaction with the <b>functional</b> subsystems of <b>expertise</b> that have arisen over the past century and more and also with a personal notion of religion that does not extend into social domains.

40|$|Based on a sociological {{conceptualization}} of knowledge as residing {{in groups of}} practitioners, epistemic communities, this article proposes a new perspective within the knowledge-based view of the firm. It argues {{that the cost of}} governing knowledge processes depends as much on the cognitive background of the exchange partners as on the tacitness of their knowledge. The perspective supports and explicates previous arguments regarding the ability of firms to enable and support integration and combination of tacit knowledge across the epistemic boundaries of professional expertise, but suggests that knowledge transactions that take place within such epistemic communities [...] articulation and replication [...] can be accommodated equally well, and often better, in other institutional settings, such as those of markets, guilds, or universities. Firms often become epistemic communities in their own right, providing them with superior enabling and motivational conditions for the combination and integration of tacit <b>functional</b> or occupational <b>expertise.</b> The establishment of a firm as an epistemic community requires transaction-specific investments on part both of the owners, managers, and employees which is why these conditions are difficult to create under market and other non-firm modes of governance. In the case of c odified knowledge, the problems associated with the crossing of epistemic boundaries can be overcome by the definition of clear interfaces between knowledge domains.

40|$|After {{two decades}} of almost {{complete}} isolation, Cambodia was rather suddenly integrated in 1991 into the global ‘free world’. As a result, the function {{and the role of}} the administration had to be modified. These transformations in the name of modernization and development have led to a significant rise of professionals, as these provide the necessary knowledge to manage the ongoing socio-economic and political transformations. Due to their educational socialization in urban centers and overseas, they consider themselves the most modern section of their society. Their common objective is to make the organizations they work for less rigid and to reform them along lines of technical-pragmatic concepts. Especially for the professionals working within the Cambodian state, the movement towards more efficiency and effectiveness in the administration and the strengthening of the rule of law is seen as a means to increase credibility of the Government on one hand and to attract foreign investment on the other. However, due to their <b>functional</b> specialization and <b>expertise,</b> professionals in Cambodia are marginalized from the overall socio-political changes in their environment. This has led to the reduction of their possibilities to communicate and organize effectively. Instead, their knowledge is applied to serve the requirements of their organizations/ patron-client networks and not as a resource to form alliances on a national or on a transnational level. A potential exists though for the professionals working in the state administration to either form a strategic group through processes of hybridization, or to form a ‘neutral’ rational administration after the ceding of the ‘old guard’ and thus their ‘disentanglement’ from old clientele structures...|$|R
