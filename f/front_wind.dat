40|$|Abstract: Thunderstorm {{generated}} gust fronts {{are responsible}} for structural damage {{in many areas of}} the world. However, the resulting impact of gust <b>front</b> <b>winds</b> is not understood to the level that flow kinematics, dynamics and its impact on structures can be quantified. Gust <b>front</b> <b>winds</b> are highly transient and have a flow profile that differs significantly from a typical boundary layer flow field. This study focuses on investigating the effects of flow profile and its transient nature on the aerodynamics of bluff, prismatic bodies. A gust front flow field is modeled using a multiple fan wind tunnel and the resulting surface pressures are captured on a suite of prismatic models, which vary in size in relationship to the oncoming wind profile. The temporal variations in surface pressures are analyzed using traditional time, frequency and time-frequency domain approaches. Results indicate the changing nature of the surface pressure field in time, highlighting differences between local and area-averaged pressures under a host of flow profiles. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2008, TIV 2 {{received}} several modifications, mostly focused on reducing the vehicle's 16,500 lb weight. To achieve this, certain less crucial areas of TIV 2's armor were converted from steel to aluminum while more vital areas were reinforced with supplemental composite armor consisting of thin layers of steel, Kevlar, polycarbonate, and rubber. In all, the weight reduction measures brought TIV 2's weight down to 14,300 lb. The safety systems were also improved, with the three <b>front</b> <b>wind</b> skirts being consolidated into one and new hydraulic stabilizing spikes to further increase stability in high winds. Other modifications included additional doors that provided every seat position with an exit (wind skirts up or down), and a redesigned IMAX turret with 50% more windows.

Most unmarked patrol cars are silver, {{although a few}} navy blue, black, maroon, and dark-brown cars exist. Recently they received the new Ford Police Interceptor sedan in all silver with no marking and a light bar on top and lights on the front side and back. The Interceptor is also equipped with a front crash bumper with lights. Also, they have unmarked new Ford Interceptors with hidden lights on <b>front</b> <b>wind</b> shield and back. The CSP {{has had a long}} history of using unmarked patrol cars on the state's highways, only identifiable as police vehicles by the red and blue light bars on the top. The words [...] "State Police" [...] are labelled on the center of the light bar. The colored lightbars are slowly fading out of use to the new crystal clear LED lightbars. Patrol cars are outfitted with LED warning lights on the roof and rear deck, 800 MHz Digital radio systems, Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs), and Mobile Video Cameras (MVRs). Some of the older vehicles have a [...] "State Trooper" [...] placard on the rear. The CSP has also had a long history of using non-traditional unmarked patrol cars for enforcement such as Chevrolet Camaros, Ford Mustangs, Ford Explorers, Grand Nationals, Mazda MX-6s, Ford F-Series pickup trucks, and Dodge Chargers. In 2016, they started using Unmarked Chevrolet Caprice cruisers. These units are not equipped with light bars and instead utilize more low profile emergency lighting systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation {{of the effect}} of vehicle orientation on the hourly vehicle cooling load profile. This profile enables prediction of a maximum cooling load and hence maximum cooling capacity to be supplied for equipment selection. The correlations and equations proposed by ASHRAE and previous researchers and compressed Singapore weather data from the open literature were used. Four vehicle orientations: North, East, South, and West were considered for a 1. 6 L Proton Wira Aeroback passenger car. The steady-state heat balance concept was adopted for the cooling load model. A validation exercise indicates that the simulation results are within 6 % of published results. In this study, the cooling load profile predicts a maximum load between 12. 00 noon and 1. 00 pm for all typical days due to high values of solar radiation intensity and outdoor air dry bulb temperature compared to other hours. The highest cooling load occurs when the <b>front</b> <b>wind</b> screen is facing East in March/April at 2. 71 kW. Thus, with a 5 % safety factor, the highest cooling load is estimated at 2. 85 kW.

Especially the way the precision tolerances are achieved in cars. Hence the precision tolerance gives the aesthetic appeal for gap and flushness. It plays a vital role in the saleability of the vehicle. There are three priority areas of a passenger car which influences the prospective customer. The priority 1 includes the front-rear door and headlamp-hood interfaces. The priority 2 includes the A pillar to roof and <b>front</b> <b>wind</b> shield interfaces. The priority 3 includes door to rocker moulding and hood to grille interfaces. Here the importance is given to the customer's view perspective. For example, in a side closures (car door assembly), the front-rear door interfaces which lies between the B pillar and the rear door region is given importance since it has the high priority as seen by the customer (Priority 1). Whereas the door to rocker moulding interfaces which lies on the bottom surface of the car is given low priority (Priority 3). Based on these priorities the gap and flushness effectively achieved through the tolerance management. This research paper aims to investigate the influences of tolerancing methods and aspects of perceived quality on the side closures with respect to computer aided tolerancing, hinge positioning, Striker and hinge adjustments and hemming. These influences in turn gives the side closures superior aesthetic appeal, loyal customers and winning edge in the saleability of luxury cars in the global market...|$|E
