Inspired by the <b>Human</b> <b>Right</b> to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de Agua Potable) available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a <b>human</b> <b>right</b> that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|This article takes a {{new look}} at a {{perennial}} question of human rights: how to prevent corporate-related <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> abuses and provide remedies for victims. It argues that transnational corporations require specialized and targeted regulations and laws, and that the conflation of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law and international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law should be reversed to allow the advancement of other forms of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law. It makes two proposals. First, reimagine <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law and international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law as separate categories. Specifically, classify international <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law as a sub-category of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law. This distinction highlights the need to encourage the development of other forms of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law, for example, global <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law and national <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> law.

The EU lacks a solid legal entrenchment of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> and there are different degrees of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> protection in the Member States which amount to different hierarchical concepts of <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b> There are legal shortcomings regarding EU’s <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> promotion to third countries, while the Copenhagen <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> conditionality attached to EU accession was vaguely stated and was not underpinned by EU internal <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> templates.
