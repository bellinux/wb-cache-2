40|$|Poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation (PARylation) is {{involved}} in the maintaining of genomic methylation pattern through its control of DNA methyltranferase 1 (Dnmt 1) activity. Our previous findings indicated the CCCTC binding factor/Ctcf as an important player in the mechanism by which PARylation controls the non methylated status of some CpG rich regions. Ctcf is able to activate Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp 1) which, in turn, inhibits Dnmt 1 activity by ADP-ribose polymers located on Parp 1 itself. According to this mechanism, Ctcf may act in preserving the epigenetic pattern at promoters of important <b>housekeeping</b> genes. <b>Data</b> here reported evidence Dnmt 1 as a new protein partner of Ctcf. Moreover, we show that Ctcf forms a complex with Dnmt 1 and PARylated Parp 1 at specific Ctcf target sequences and that PARylation is responsible for the maintaining of the non methylated status of some Ctcf-bound CpGs. All this suggests a mechanism by which Parp 1, tethered and activated at specific DNA targets by Ctcf, preserves their methylation free status...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of scanner measurements was evaluated when the sampling frequency of sensor <b>housekeeping</b> (HK) <b>data</b> was reduced from once every scan to once every eight scans. The resulting increase in uncertainty was greatest for sources with rapid or extreme temperature changes. This analysis {{focused on the}} mirror attenuator mosaic (MAM) baffle and plate and scanner radiometer baffle due to their relatively high temperature changes during solar calibrations. Since only solar simulator data were available, the solar temperatures were approximated on these components and the radiative and thermal gradients in the MAM baffle due to reflected sunlight. Of the two cases considered for the MAM plate and baffle temperatures, one uses temperatures obtained from the ground calibration. The other attempt uses temperatures computed from the MAM baffle model. This analysis shows that the heat input variations due largely to the solar radiance and irradiance during a scan cycle are small. It also demonstrates that reasonable intervals longer than the current HK data acquisition interval should not significantly affect the estimation of a radiation field in the sensor field-of-view...|$|R

To determine whether miRNAs {{are associated with}} cytogenetic abnormalities and clinical features in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated the miRNA expression of CD 34 + cells and 122 untreated adult AML cases using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization using a set of <b>housekeeping</b> genes, <b>data</b> were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. An independent set of 60 untreated AML patients was used to validate the outcome signatures using real time PCR. We identified several miRNAs differentially expressed between CD 34 + normal cells and the AML samples. MiRNA expression was also closely associated with selected cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities like t(11 q 23), isolated trisomy 8 and FLT 3 -ITD mutations. Furthermore, patients with high expression of miR- 191 and miR- 199 a had significantly worse overall and event free survival than AML patients with low expression (Overall survival: miR- 191 P= 0. 03 and miR- 199 a P= 0. 0006, Cox regression). In conclusion, miRNA expression in AML is closely associated with cytogenetics and FLT 3 -ITD mutations. A small subset of miRNAs is correlated with survival...|$|R

40|$|The Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) will {{observe the}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by {{covering}} the frequency range 30 - 70 GHz in three bands. The primary instrument data source are the temperature samples {{acquired by the}} 22 radiometers mounted on the Planck focal plane. Such samples represent the scientific data of LFI. In addition, the LFI instrument generates the so called <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> by sampling regularly the on-board sensors and registers. The <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> provides information on the overall health status of the instrument and on the scientific data quality. The scientific and <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> are collected on-board into telemetry packets compliant with the ESA Packet Telemetry standards.

40|$|Extended {{monitoring}} of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> {{is required to}} increase the observability of a spacecrafts health status, its environment and resulting mechanical stress {{as well as physical}} parameters like the spacecrafts position and orientation. This implies the application of an increasing number of onboard sensors for various physical quantities like temperature, vibration, acceleration, voltage, current and others. These sensors need to offer high resolution in the time domain and high accuracy. The amount of data produced by an extended housekeeping system proves increasingly significant. However, to customers, <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> is not of direct value and has therefore been subordinated to scientific payload data in terms of the allocation of bandwidth towards ground. In order to optimize the information throughput for a given bandwidth budget, data compression such as entropy coding as well as lossy data compaction need to be applied. At the same time, the accuracy and the allowed magnitude of error of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> is crucial to its value for ground engineers. As a result, especially lossy data compaction has to be applied carefully taking into account the nature of the data to be processed. In this paper, we evaluate transform-based compression techniques and analyze their effect on <b>housekeeping</b> <b>data</b> and suitability for subsequent entropy coding on board spacecrafts. To do so, we apply a variety of transforms to real sensor data collected by launchers (ARIANE 5) as well as satellites (AISat) and analyze their performance in terms of data quality, compression ratio, computing effciency and effectiveness of subsequent entropy coding. Our results show that a data reduction of 96. 5 % for quickly oscilatting vibration sensors and of 99. 5 % for slower temperature sensors can be achieved without introducing a significant error during critical time frames within data sequences...|$|E

Telemetry is typically a mixture of payload or <b>housekeeping</b> health <b>data.</b> Engineering or health data is composed {{of a wide range}} of measurements, from switch positions and subsystem states to voltages, temperatures and pressures. Telemetry may be transmitted in real time, or it may be written to a data storage device until transmission is feasible.

Packet Telemetry and Telemetry Channel Coding services provide to the user reliable and transparent delivery of telemetry information. With the error detecting and correcting capability of the channel code chosen, errors which occur as a result of the physical transmission process may be detected and corrected by the receiving entity.

40|$|Asexual {{bacterial}} populations inevitably {{consist of}} {{an assemblage of}} distinct clonal lineages. However, bacterial populations are not entirely asexual since recombinational exchanges occur, mobilizing small genome segments among lineages and species. The relative contribution of recombination, as opposed to de novo mutation, in the generation of new bacterial genotypes varies among bacterial populations and, as this contribution increases, the clonality of a given population decreases. In consequence, a spectrum of possible population structures exists, with few bacterial species occupying the extremes of highly clonal and completely non-clonal, most containing both clonal and non-clonal elements.
