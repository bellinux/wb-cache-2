5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to fisheries science, {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably {{due to the fact that}} his stuff isn’t widely available...
