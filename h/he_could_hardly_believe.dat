2500|$|When Milner was 10 years old, {{he joined}} the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a scout while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth. At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, {{including}} future Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. His role model was Leeds-born Alan Smith, who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, {{to come through the}} academy and play for the first team. Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education. Milner remarked later {{that he did not want}} to get excited and think that he had [...] "made it". He also said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> he was playing alongside first-team Leeds players such as David Batty and Olivier Dacourt. He continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels. He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against Italy, Czech Republic and Brazil, scoring a goal against the latter. Milner claims to have never consumed alcohol throughout his life, despite pressures from those around him when he was growing up.|$|E

60|$|Pere Lenegre {{admitted}} {{himself that}} though he actually saw milor transforming himself into citizen Rouget, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his eyes, so complete was the change.|$|E
60|$|Paolo was {{astonished}} indeed when Hector {{handed him the}} general's present. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> at first <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> that it was meant for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She has no pain,' <b>he</b> said. 'She <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe,</b> {{when she}} came round, that the tooth was out. It is a relief, indeed. She has cried, day and night, {{for the past three}} days.' ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{drew closer}} to the table, and glancing at Monks {{with an air of}} {{careless}} levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have <b>believed</b> the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} he was sound asleep, and when his brother roused him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it was time}} for him to go on duty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] stammered Dan. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his ears. He {{took the}} {{slip of paper}} Mr. Walters handed to him and rose to his feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not see}} {{her again}} till the next afternoon. She came out into the ante-room in the hotel looking so lovely <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his good fortune.|$|E
60|$|The {{heart of}} Barnet was {{sufficiently}} impressionable {{to be influenced}} by Downe's parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome home as he imagined: the dreary night might, at least on this one occasion, make Downe's forecast true. Hence it was in a suspense that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have <b>believed</b> possible that he halted at his door. On entering his wife was nowhere to be seen, and he inquired for her. The servant informed him that her mistress had the dressmaker with her, and would be engaged for some time.|$|R
60|$|Devine, however, {{looked more}} closely about, and it struck {{him that the}} ground had dried with {{remarkable}} rapidity; indeed, {{if he had not}} felt the hail, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have <b>believed</b> the plain had been wet. For all that, not venturing to hope for fear of meeting a heavier shock, he said nothing to his comrade, and presently they dipped into a hollow. They could not see across the ridge in front, and Harding urged his horses savagely when they came to the ascent. The animals' coats were foul, spume dripped from the bits, and their sides were white where the traces slapped, but they breasted the hill pluckily. The men were grim and highly strung, braced to meet the worst. To Harding it meant ruin and the downfall of all his plans; to Devine his wedding put off. It might be some years before he made good, and he feared that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer count on his comrade's help. If Harding were forced to give up his farm, he might leave the prairie.|$|R
60|$|The mists had congregated {{about the}} distant mountain-side, {{and there were}} seen the grand and awful {{features}} of the Great Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills, and enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture of gold and purple. As <b>he</b> looked, Ernest <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> but that a smile beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still brightening, although without motion of the lips. It was probably {{the effect of the}} western sunshine, melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at. But--as it always did--the aspect of his marvellous friend made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.|$|R
60|$|Ashe drew it out. He {{stood looking}} at it, absorbed. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his quest was at an end and that a small fortune lay {{in the palm of}} his hand. Freddie was eyeing him admiringly.|$|E
60|$|The footwarmer was brought, and Trefusis {{composed}} himself comfortably for his journey. It {{seemed very}} short to him; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe,</b> {{when the train}} arrived in London, {{that he had been}} nearly three hours on the way.|$|E
60|$|The three sat up {{for half}} an hour longer, talking matters over. Of course Jack Wumble wanted to know about Mr. Rover, and was sorry to learn that the boys' father was not well. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> that Dick was married.|$|E
60|$|Floods {{of tears}} {{restored}} the dame {{to some sort}} of composure; but she declared she could stay no longer in a house where her son had been ill-used and deceived, and she had been insulted. The alderman thought the insult had been the other way, but he was too glad to be rid of her on any terms to gainsay her, and at his own charge, undertook to procure horse and escort to convey her safely to Salisbury the next morning. He advised Stephen to keep out of her sight {{for the rest of the}} day, giving leave of absence, so that the youth, as one treading on air, set forth to carry to his brother, his aunt, and if possible, his uncle, the intelligence that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> as yet <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> was more than a happy dream.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{accordingly}} {{started at}} a gallop towards the trees; {{it was not}} until he was close to them that he saw three giraffes, two old ones and a young one. They started off, as he approached, at a pace which seemed to Dick to be slow, as well as extraordinarily clumsy. The two old ones kept themselves between their offspring and the pursuer, as if to shield it from a shot. Dick, however, had no idea of firing; he only wished to gallop up close, so as to get a nearer view of these singular beasts, but to his astonishment he found that, although his horse was going at its best speed, the apparently slow-moving giraffes were steadily gaining upon him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> at first <b>believe</b> his eyes. But he was gradually tailed off, and at last, reining in his horse, he sat in the saddle and enjoyed a good laugh at the strange trio in front of him, with their long, straggling legs and necks.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him. In the popular phrase, I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> my own ears.|$|R
6000|$|Now when Johnny Chuck heard this, great anger {{filled his}} heart. A {{stranger}} had {{ordered him to}} leave the Green Meadows where he had been born and always lived! <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his own ears. He, Johnny Chuck, would show this stranger who was master here! ...|$|E
60|$|The king {{lay in bed}} {{sick with}} sorrow, and neither eating nor drinking, for he thought that his son {{had been killed by}} the queen. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his own eyes for joy when he saw the prince, and Sigurd told him all his adventures.|$|E
6000|$|The moments went by so fast that, {{when the}} last bell sounded, and Joe heard the cry of [...] "All ashore that's going," [...] <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> it {{possible}} {{that he had been}} on the boat more than an hour, waiting for the gentleman and his sick friend.|$|E
60|$|Monday morning brought another letter. At first, he {{was struck}} with the dread of evil tidings of Amabel or her babe, {{especially}} when he recognized Charles's straggling handwriting; and, resolved not to be again betrayed, he carried it up to read in his own room before his sister had noticed it. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> resolve to open it, for surely Charles would not write to him without necessity; and what, save sorrow, could cause that necessity? He saw that his wretchedness might be even more complete! At length he read it, and <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his own eyes as he saw cheering words, in a friendly style of interest and kindliness such as {{he would never have}} expected from Charles, more especially now.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> that. When I {{had opened}} the office and swept it {{everything}} appeared all right.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> {{him guilty}} {{of such an}} odious crime if he confessed it with his own lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little fearfully {{but with}} the {{beginning}} of a little hope Mr. Mouse jumped with all his might. Away he sailed straight and true and landed lightly on his feet so far from where he had left the ground that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his own eyes as he looked back. Mother Nature was smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{if this is}} a farmer's house I wouldn't {{wonder if}} a good bit of Pip Smith's yarn was true," [...] Seth muttered to himself, as he turned toward the sink, over which hung a towel so white that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> he would be allowed to dry his face and hands with it.|$|E
6000|$|At last, Harry's Black Prince had {{hurried into}} the hut with the tidings that his English father's ship was in the bay, and soon English voices again sounded in his ears, {{bringing}} the forlorn boy such warmth of kindness that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> himself a mere stranger. If Alan could but have shared the joy with him! ...|$|E
60|$|The Earl and Countess <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>he</b> {{should have}} consented that his {{daughter}} should be thus employed, {{and he had to}} excuse himself with what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not help feeling were only half truths.|$|R
60|$|At first Tom <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> what <b>he</b> heard. Then he sank down, {{and buried}} {{his face in}} his hands.|$|R
60|$|My word, I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> my ears! I {{thought that}} I {{should have had}} my {{regiment}} at the least.|$|R
60|$|He marvelled at this {{immediate}} escape. The {{work was}} done. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> it. He fought {{with an almost}} irresistible longing to {{lie down on the}} pavement and sleep. But this sort of faintness--a drowsy faintness--passed off quickly. He walked faster, making his way to one of the poorer parts of the town in order to look up Ziemianitch.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir." [...] <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> he {{had said}} the words, or {{that they would be}} so readily accepted, for Mr. Harrison had only the {{impression}} that he knew who the guilty person was, and would not tell, and, therefore, put no more questions to him, but, after a few more vain inquiries, was baffled, and gave up the investigation.|$|E
60|$|He was {{certainly}} a whole-hearted convert. As to Saul of Tarsus, so to him there had come a sudden blinding light. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> {{that he was the}} same person who had scoffed at the idea of a man giving up his life to one woman and being happy. But then the abstract wife had been a pale, bloodless phantom, and Ruth was real.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> my eyes. Then I gave a wild cry that caused Phil {{to jump up}} in alarm.|$|R
