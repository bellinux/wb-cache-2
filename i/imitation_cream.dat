50|$|MimicCreme was a {{brand of}} vegan <b>imitation</b> <b>cream</b> based on nuts and made without lactose, soy, or gluten. It was {{certified}} as pareve kosher. First produced commercially in January 2007 in Albany, New York, by Green Rabbit LLC, MimicCreme was primarily marketed toward vegans {{as an alternative to}} dairy products.The company website indicates that the company closed in November 2013 due to no longer having access to an appropriate production facility (they are still looking for one).|$|E
50|$|Bulla Family Dairy {{is a major}} Australian dairy {{company that}} {{manufactures}} a national and export range of ice cream, table cream, yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese, and <b>imitation</b> <b>cream</b> under various brands. The business was established in 1910 and subsequently became a partnership among three inter-related families, who still own and operate the business to this day. In 1930, the company acquired the Colac Ice Works and the Regal Cream brand which continued as a local ice cream route brand until 2004 when it was re-badged as Bulla. The company employs over 450 people across three manufacturing sites in Colac, Victoria, Dandenong, Victoria, and also in Mulgrave, Victoria, and a head office and distribution centre in Derrimut, Melbourne.|$|E
40|$|During Food and Drug Administration {{inspections}} of 12 <b>imitation</b> <b>cream</b> pie producers, 453 finished product samples and 350 line {{samples were collected}} and analyzed bacteriologically. Sanitary conditions in the plants varied from good to poor and, in general, were reflected in the bacteriological results. The survey revealed that, in {{the great majority of}} cases, frozen imitation-cream pies produced in plants operating under good conditions of sanitation had the following bacteriological content: (i) a most probable number (MPN) of fewer than three Escherichia coli cells per gram (i. e., absent from all tubes in the methodology employed), (ii) an average MPN of fewer than 50 coliforms per gram (10 or more pies), (iii) the absence of coagulase-positive staphylococci in 0. 1 -g portions, and (iv) an aerobic plate count of fewer than 25, 000 per gram (geometric mean of 10 or more pies) ...|$|E

40|$|Whipping creams are oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which by whipping can be formed to a foam by {{the incorporation of}} air into the system. Traditionally whipping creams are made out of milk but today <b>imitation</b> whipping <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat has gained {{a large share of}} the marked due to their many benefits compared to traditionally whipping <b>creams.</b> <b>Imitation</b> whipping <b>creams</b> are both cheaper and more flexible than traditionally creams. By vary the characteristics of the fat system and the cream recipe the properties of the <b>imitation</b> <b>creams</b> can be adapted to fit the purpose of a specific product. The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of how different types of fat systems and other ingredients affect the properties of <b>imitation</b> whipping <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat. This was done by studying three vegetable fat systems with different physicochemical properties. The properties of the fat systems were characterized and the three fat systems were then used for making different <b>imitation</b> whipping <b>creams.</b> The properties of the creams were characterized and the properties of the fat systems and the creams were assessed and compared with each other. The study showed that the fat characteristics that generally seem to have the highest impact on the properties of whipping creams are the structure, the solid fat content and the crystallization temperature of the fat. A fat solution with a hard structure, a high crystallization temperature and a high solid fat content at a wide range of temperatures overall seem to provide the whipping creams with the best properties. This as these fat properties provide the creams with a high foam stability, a high overrun and a short whipping time. This study has also shown that other ingredients than the fat systems provide the creams with diverging properties. This is best shown by the results of the freeze-thaw stability which indicate that a recipe with a high amount of sugar seem to provide the whipping creams with good freeze-thaw stability. Other properties of the whipping creams also seem to be very much influenced by other ingredients than the fat systems but further studies are needed to provide clarity to the complexity of the interplay of the ingredients in whipped creams...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of spray-dried whippable emulsions (toppings) containing {{different types of}} lipid surfactants, was investigated by electron microscopy using the freeze-fracture technique. The size distribution of the lipid particles within the powders varied {{with the type of}} the surfactant used. After reconstitution of the topping powders in water. a strong destabilization phenomenon took place to an extent {{depending on the type of}} the surfactant. Simultaneously a crystallization of coalesced lipid particles occurred along with an increase in viscosity of the emulsions. The degree of crystallization was measured by p-NMR. It has been concluded that these phenomena are closely related to whippability and foam firmness. The {{structure of}} whipped topping emulsions (foam) is characterized by the presence of large lipid crystals at the surface of air bubbles. This structure is different from the structure of whipped liquid (<b>imitation)</b> <b>cream</b> or dairy cream, where the air bubbles are predominantly stabilized by agglomerated fat globules from which the surface membrane has been partly removed during the whipping process...|$|E

5000|$|Cool Whip is a {{brand of}} <b>imitation</b> whipped <b>cream,</b> {{referred}} to as whipped topping by its manufacturer. It is used in North America as a dessert topping and in some no-bake pie recipes. It was originally described as [...] "non-dairy" [...] as it contained neither cream nor milk and no lactose; however, it did contain the milk derivative caseinate.|$|R
2500|$|In Mexico, certain Japanese {{restaurants}} have created {{what is known}} as [...] "sushi Mexicano", in which spicy sauces and ingredients accompany the dish or are integrated in sushi rolls. The habanero and serrano chiles have become nearly standard and are referred to as chiles toreados, as they are fried, diced and tossed over a dish upon request. A popular sushi topping, [...] "Tampico", is made by blending chiles, mayonnaise, and <b>imitation</b> crab. <b>Cream</b> cheese and avocado are often added to makizushi.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, Whitaker and Baxter {{worked on}} {{political}} and policy questions, though they also aided firms with corporate public relations, such as improving {{the image of}} cottonseed oil or <b>imitation</b> ice <b>cream.</b> Their political clientele was mostly Republicans of the 1940s and 1950s, including Governor Earl Warren, Governor Goodwin Knight, and Dwight Eisenhower's California Presidential campaign. Though Whitaker and Baxter ostensibly helped all those who approached their firm, in practice they were committed to small-government conservatism and forestalling or rolling back the New Deal. One of their most influential campaigns was helping the American Medical Association fight off the national health insurance plans of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [...] Though unmentioned in the film, much of the archival anti-national health care propaganda seen in Michael Moore's Sicko, including Ronald Reagan's phonograph speech on how national health care {{is the first step}} towards socialism, was produced in 1949 under the direction of Whitaker and Baxter.|$|R
5000|$|Artificial cream (or [...] "dessert topping") is an <b>imitation</b> of whipped <b>cream</b> {{containing}} some non-dairy fats. Examples are Cool Whip and Elmlea. Artificial {{cream is}} usually made from vegetable oil, not butterfat, and contains no butyric acid. However, most leading brands do contain dairy products and therefore are {{not suitable for}} vegans or people who avoid dairy because of dietary or religious reasons. Artificial cream often contains sugar or other sweeteners. Artificial cream is sold as whipped, ready-to-serve topping in plastic tubs and aerosol containers and {{in the form of}} powders which must be whipped with a liquid before use. Artificial cream {{can be used as a}} topping on pies, cakes and sundaes.|$|R
40|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} fats {{may be used as}} cheap {{substitutes}} for milk fat to manufacture imitation cheese or <b>imitation</b> ice <b>cream.</b> In this study, 400 [*]MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the fat fraction of the products was used in the context of food surveillance to validate the labeling of milk-based products. For sample preparation, the fat was extracted using an automated Weibull-Stoldt methodology. Using principal component analysis (PCA), imitation products can be easily detected. In both cheese and ice cream, a differentiation according to the type of raw material (milk fat and vegetable fat) was possible. The loadings plot shows that imitation products were distinguishable by differences in their fatty acid ratios. Furthermore, a differentiation of several types of cheese (Edamer, Gouda, Emmentaler, and Feta) was possible. Quantitative data regarding the composition of the investigated products can also be predicted from the same spectra using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The models obtained for 13 compounds in cheese (R 2 0. 75 – 0. 95) and 17 compounds in ice cream (R 2 0. 83 – 0. 99) (e. g., fatty acids and esters) were suitable for a screening analysis. NMR spectroscopy was judged as suitable for the routine analysis of dairy products based on milk or on vegetable fat substitutes...|$|R
