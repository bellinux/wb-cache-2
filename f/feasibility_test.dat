500|$|The same method {{also can}} be used as a {{subroutine}} when the individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters can be achieved without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a <b>feasibility</b> <b>test</b> of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure the size of a cluster. The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and [...] shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of [...] for the sum-of-diameters clustering problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{performance}} verifications of architecture models of real-time embedded systems. We focus on models verified with the real-time scheduling theory. To perform verifications with the real-time scheduling theory, the architecture designers must check that their models are compliant with {{the assumptions of}} this theory. Unfortunately, this task is difficult since it requires that designers have a deep understanding of the real-time scheduling theory. In this article, we investigate how to help designers to check that an architecture model is compliant with this theory. We focus on <b>feasibility</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Feasibility</b> <b>tests</b> are analytical methods proposed by the real-time scheduling theory. We show how to explicitly model the relationships between an architectural model and <b>feasibility</b> <b>tests.</b> From these models, we apply a model-based engineering process to generate a decision tool what is able to detect from an architecture model which are the <b>feasibility</b> <b>tests</b> that the designer can apply. ...|$|R

Policy <b>feasibility</b> <b>testing</b> provides a guide to the viability and practicality of policy implementation and forms an important part of an evidence based policy making process. An extensive literature review has identified no standardized approach to <b>feasibility</b> <b>testing.</b> This paper addresses this knowledge gap by describing a novel method using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for <b>feasibility</b> <b>testing</b> of policies aimed at increasing the sustainability of towns and villages in Ireland. Feasibility results are provided for 40 frequently cited policy interventions tested for 18 settlements in Ireland. Policies were selected in the arenas of transport, food, housing and urban form, energy, waste and water. Policies are <b>feasibility</b> <b>tested</b> through analysis of operational evidence from both quantitative and qualitative data sources. Following testing, policies are ranked in terms of feasibility. This research examines the effectiveness of local and national level policies and the importance of both local community involvement and central government regulation in policy success. The inter-settlement variation in <b>feasibility</b> <b>testing</b> scores prioritises policy selection and aims to reduce cherry-picking of policies to support the viewpoints of the decision maker.

50|$|Hartley {{proposed}} a scheme using adapted underwater power cable developed by Siemens Brothers, (in {{conjunction with the}} National Physical Laboratory) was adopted and it {{became known as the}} HAIS pipeline.

The design of HAIS was refined {{as a result of a}} series of tests, the main changes being to increase the layers of steel tape armouring from two to four and to manufacture the inner lead pipe using extrusion thereby avoiding a longitudinal seam. In March 1943, in a full-scale <b>feasibility</b> <b>test,</b> HMS Holdfast laid a pipeline between Swansea and Ilfracombe, a distance of about 30 mi; the pipe supplied North Devon and Cornwall with petrol for over a year. The <b>feasibility</b> <b>test</b> used a pipe with an internal diameter of 2 in, the same as the original power cable had had, the specification was increased to 3 in to allow three times as much petrol to be pumped through.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper aims at generalizing the {{well-known}} Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem by considering additional constraints. The first type of constraints we consider requires the interpolation function {{to be of}} a given degree. Several results are provided for different degree constraints. These results offer <b>feasibility</b> <b>tests</b> via linear matrix inequalities. We have {{identified a number of}} degree constraints for which the <b>feasibility</b> <b>tests</b> are exact. For other degree constraints, we offer a relaxation scheme for checking the feasibility. The second type of constraints we study is about spectral zero assignment, which demands the zeros of the spectral factorization of the interpolation function to be at given locations. This problem can be solved using an iterative algorithm by Byrnes, Georgiou and Linquist. However, we provide a much faster iterative algorithm for this problem, although a proof of convergence is yet to be offered. I...|$|R
