5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main <b>historical</b> <b>events.</b> These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Martin {{wrote the}} episode and its {{accompanying}} songs and music. The episode {{was directed by}} Mark Kirkland and Bob Hope made a guest appearance. The episode references various films, music, and <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> and was well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> gather macroseismic data from written records from cities {{that may not have}} been anywhere near the epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population (where the people were) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of <b>historical</b> <b>events.</b> Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E
50|$|Lewis also {{address those}} {{skeptical of the}} Resurrection of Jesus. Even if one interprets the crucifixion of Jesus as a {{strictly}} <b>historical</b> <b>event,</b> this doesn't preclude its subsequent mythologization. But neither does it negate its historicity. The claim of the Gospel writers is that Jesus' resurrection is a specific <b>historical</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

5|$|Attractions include guided tours, a visitors' centre with {{searchable}} convict database, art gallery, café, gift shop, {{and tourist}} accommodation. Educational activities are regularly held for school children, as are exhibitions and re-enactments of <b>historical</b> <b>events.</b> Functions such as theme parties and dinners {{are held in}} the prison, with re-enactments serving as entertainment. Tours of the prison show aspects of prison life and recount successful and attempted escapes. Sections of the tunnels are accessible, and night tours focus on the prison's reputation for being haunted.|$|E
5|$|By {{featuring}} {{the life of}} John of Lancaster from early childhood to young adulthood, Heyer conveys a full glimpse of medieval life – court intrigues {{as well as the}} lives of ordinary people are part of the story. Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major <b>historical</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

5|$|Children's book Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce {{is partly}} set in Ely and {{includes}} a scene in Ely Cathedral and scenes inspired by the author's father's own childhood experiences of skating along the frozen river from Cambridge to Ely in the frost of 1894–95. The first series of Jim Kelly's crime novels, featuring journalist Philip Dryden, is largely set in the author's home town of Ely and in the Fens. Graham Swift's 1983 novel Waterland takes place, and recounts several <b>historical</b> <b>events,</b> {{in and around the}} town of Ely.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to <b>historical</b> <b>events,</b> medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E

5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the Doctor was portrayed by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the episodes were a mixture of stories set on earth of the future with extraterrestrial influence, on alien planets, and in <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> without extraterrestrial influence, such as Marco Polo, one of the lost serials. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the Doctor gradually grew weaker {{to the point of}} collapsing {{at the end of the}} fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> that {{reinforce}} scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) finds a tell-tale magazine story supposedly revealing the history of The Smoking Man (William B. Davis). The episode illustrates his possible involvement in several <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> and assassinations, although {{the reliability of the}} source is unresolved {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

5|$|Villani was {{inspired}} to write his Cronica after attending the jubilee celebration in Rome in 1300 and noting the venerable history of that city. He outlined the events in his Cronica year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format. He provided intricate details on many important <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> {{of the city of}} Florence and the wider region of Tuscany, such as construction projects, floods, fires, famines, and plagues.|$|E
5|$|Yet both {{reflect an}} inseparable {{integrity}} and regard for accuracy and truth, {{expressed in terms}} both of <b>historical</b> <b>events</b> and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia, felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and {{that as a result}} miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of <b>historical</b> <b>events.</b> Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
