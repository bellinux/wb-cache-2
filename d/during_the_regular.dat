5|$|The Volunteers' rushing offense {{had been}} led by Aaron Hayden <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, but Hayden broke his leg during Tennessee's final regular season game. Due to the injury, James Stewart was {{forecast}} {{to start the}} game at running back for the Volunteers. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, Tennessee was ranked No. 13 in rushing, accumulating an average of 231.2 rushing yards per game. Stewart accounted for 93.5 yards of that total, having carried the ball 170 times for 1,028 yards and 11 touchdowns <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season. One of Tennessee's other backup running backs, Jay Graham, was predicted to be {{kept out of the}} game due to an injury, but played after undergoing surgery. Graham, who rushed 61 times for 275 yards <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, suffered a broken jaw after being punched in the face by a teammate. Because of the injury to Graham, fourth-string running back Ronnie Pillow, who had carried the ball just five times <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, was predicted to back up Stewart during the game.|$|E

Arizona was led defensively <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season by Jake Fischer, who accumulated 119 total tackles, while Nevada was led by Albert Rosette who totaled 135 regular season tackles.|$|E
5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} national championship game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game. Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, who had gone 12–0 <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.|$|E
