5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and <b>devil</b> <b>rays</b> are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula <b>devil</b> <b>rays.</b> In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary.

Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E

He played for the Marlins' Class-AAA affiliate, the Calgary Cannons of the PCL, and {{appeared}} in five games for the Marlins. In 2002, Mottola returned to Syracuse. He began the 2003 season with the Tampa Bay <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays</b> organization, playing for the Class-AAA Durham Bulls, but was released. He signed with the Boston Red Sox on June 12 to replace Julio Zuleta, who had signed to play in Japan, on the Class-AAA Pawtucket Red Sox. Mottola signed with the Orioles for the 2004 season, splitting his time between MLB and the Class-AAA Ottawa Lynx. In 2005, {{he returned to the}} Blue Jays organization, playing with Syracuse.

5|$|The Tampa Bay Rays, {{originally}} {{named the}} <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays,</b> joined Major League Baseball at its last expansion in 1998. The team's inaugural manager was Larry Rothschild, {{who spent his}} entire managerial career with the Rays. He managed the team for parts of four seasons and accrued a 205–294 record. Rothschild was replaced during the 2001 season by Hal McRae. Before the 2003 season, McRae was replaced by Lou Piniella, who led the team for three seasons. After 2005, Piniella departed {{and was replaced by}} Joe Maddon, who has statistically been the most successful manager in franchise history. Maddon is the only manager to lead the Rays to the postseason, accumulating an 8–8 record and leading his team to the 2008 World Series. He leads all Rays managers in games managed (648), regular season wins (308) and losses (340), and winning percentage (.475). Maddon also won the 2008 and 2011 American League Manager of the Year Award. Maddon opted out of his contract in late October 2014. On December 5, 2014, the Rays hired former Cleveland Indians bullpen coach Kevin Cash to replace Maddon.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Mota {{was named}} the Marlins' closer in spring {{training}} since Benítez became a free agent following the 2004 season. He {{did not get a}} save opportunity until April 22, which he converted in a 4–2 win over Cincinnati. He got his second save of the year the next day in another 4–2 win over Cincinnati. However, he was placed on the disabled list on May 1 (retroactive to April 24) with inflammation in his right elbow. He was activated on May 27, but Todd Jones, who had been filling in for Mota, remained the closer. Mota had a 1.69 ERA through his first 11 games, but 12 earned runs allowed over his next seven games raised his ERA to 7.27. On June 24, he was the winning pitcher in the Marlins' 7–4 victory over the Tampa Bay <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays.</b> He got his only other win of the year on August 30, when he gave up a run in two innings in a 7–6 victory over St. Louis.

25|$|In 1998, the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays</b> began using the stadium for spring training. Their regular season home at Tropicana Field is approximately one mile west, making the <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays</b> {{the first major}} league team to train and play regular season games {{in the same city}} in almost 90 years. In 2006, the Rays, seeking to expand their fan base across the Tampa Bay area, decided to move their spring training operations to Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, Florida, about 80 miles south of St. Petersburg. They played their last spring training ballgame at Al Lang Stadium on March 28, 2008.|$|E

5000|$|In Justice League Unlimited a {{character}} named <b>Devil</b> <b>Ray</b> (voiced by Michael Beach) debuted {{as one of}} the primary members of the Secret Society (based on the Legion of Doom). <b>Devil</b> <b>Ray</b> is closely based on Black Manta, right down to the helmet and a suit that allowed him to breathe underwater and withstand deep-sea pressures. This suit significantly increased his strength and stamina, and was equipped with rocket boosters that enabled him to fly and navigate underwater. The two wrist mounted guns in his gauntlets allow him to shoot laser bolts and an array of venomous trident-shaped stingers at his targets. <b>Devil</b> <b>Ray</b> appeared in major roles in [...] "To Another Shore", where he was sent by Grodd to retrieve a Viking Prince's mystical body to unlock the secret of immortality. He later appeared in [...] "Dead Reckoning", where he and several other supervillains travelled to Nanda Parbat to steal a mystical orb for Grodd's plans, where <b>Devil</b> <b>Ray</b> killed several monks and their master in the process. During the final battle in Gorilla City, <b>Devil</b> <b>Ray</b> was accidentally killed by a Deadman-possessed Batman. According to writer Dwayne McDuffie, the reason behind the name change is because the rights to Aquaman characters were not available at the time, as they were being used for the Aquaman TV pilot. Within mainstream comics, in Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #52 (July 2007), the new Aquaman (Arthur Joseph Curry) inquires if Black Manta is the name of a cartoon character, and is corrected [...] "... wasn't he called Devil Ray?".|$|R

50|$|Munk's <b>devil</b> <b>ray</b> {{is found}} in {{tropical}} oceanic and coastal waters. It can be alone, in small groups or in schools, near {{the surface of the}} sea or near the seabed. As it swims, water passes into its mouth and exits through its gill slits, which filter out small particles and absorb oxygen from the water. It feeds mainly on mysids and other zooplankton but also consumes small schooling fish. Munk's <b>devil</b> <b>ray</b> has been documented to leap out of the water, either alone or in groups, performing vertical jumps, somersaults and other acrobatic manoeuvres.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{hitting a}} career-high 46 {{home runs in}} 1998, Canseco drew minimal {{attention}} in the free agent market. In 1999, he signed a three-year contract with the Tampa Bay <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays.</b> The contract included a clause stating that if Canseco were to be elected to the Hall of Fame he would be depicted {{as a member of}} the <b>Devil</b> <b>Rays.</b> That year he took the American League by storm, hitting 10 home runs in April, and leading the AL with 31 by the All-Star break (including number 400 for his career against Toronto's Kelvim Escobar). On pace for 60+ homers for the season, he was voted to the AL All-Star team as the DH, making his first All Star selection in 7 years.
