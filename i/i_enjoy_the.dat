500|$|Spoonheim was {{originally}} from Rudyard, Montana, where her family owned an auto supply store. [...] She began {{playing the piano}} at age five, when her mother would drive her on an [...] round [...] trip to Havre to take classical piano lessons. [...] By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night. She began singing as well as playing the piano during a {{time in her life}} when she lived in Billings, Montana. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children. [...] She simultaneously worked as a medical transcriptionist for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000. [...] She celebrated 50 years of employment at the Sip 'n Dip in December 2013 and at that time she was featured on CBS Sunday Morning. [...] She has released two albums, only for sale at the Sip 'n Dip, and though she takes requests, she refuses to play modern rock music. She continues to work because it is not only a job but also her social life, [...] "It's a chance {{to get out of the}} house. <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> lounge, and it keeps me going." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murtić's {{wife was}} Goranka Vrus Murtić, a {{well-known}} artist {{in her own}} right. Together they bought and renovated an old stone house {{in the town of}} Vrsar, on the Istrian coast. Although their main residence was in Zagreb, they spent much of each year in Vrsar. Of his summer house and studio, Murtić said [...] "It is really nice here, <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> silence and concentration that is irreplaceable... I do not know if I would find a more beautiful place anywhere in the world." [...] The landscape there inspired many of his paintings, especially the [...] "Montraker" [...] cycle, which is named for the nearby Ancient Roman stone quarry.|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>the</b> shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Monáe's {{signature}} {{style is}} her tuxedo wardrobe. [...] She said [...] "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could {{be buried in}} it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle <b>I</b> <b>enjoy.</b> <b>The</b> tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I {{want to be in}} the Guinness Book of World Records." [...] Monáe's signature look harkens back to dandyism. Citing Grace Jones and Josephine Baker as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th century look in the classical white and black pattern. Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career when she was employed as a maid as she revealed in her 2012 Black Girls Rock! Young, Gifted, and Black award acceptance speech. Monáe has been known to distribute her Ten Droid Commandments which encourages her fans to be individuals. The Telegraph also commented on her image as an artist saying [...] "Sitting in a grey, airless record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes." [...] She has described her tuxedos as being a uniform for her career. She also featured in the [...] "Style 100" [...] of InStyle magazine.|$|E
