40|$|This paper {{describes}} distributed (or decentralized) protocols {{for establishing}} wavelength paths in point-to-point WDM networks. Distributed control improves reliability and reduces implementation {{cost of a}} network, but also presents major challenges in managing/allocating wavelengths efficiently. Two types of distributed wavelength reservation protocols are proposed and evaluated, namely forward and backward. The benefit of wavelength conversion is assessed first based on {{the evaluation of the}} forward reservation protocols, and it is found that wavelength conversion can result in a performance advantage in a distributed environment. For networks without wavelength conversion, a class of backward reservation protocols is studied and shown to generally perform better than their <b>forward</b> <b>counterparts.</b> 1 This work {{was supported in part by}} NSF award MIP 9409864 to the State University of New York, and by NSF awards CCR- 9157371 and MIP 96 - 33729 to the University of Pittsburgh. 1 Introducti [...] ...|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} {{in this article}} the use of constant envelope modulation in 2 -way 3 -phase cooperative transmission. Specifically, a technique referred to as PSPF is proposed and its BER performance compared to 1 -way relaying and to 2 -way relaying based on decode-and-forward and multi-level re-modulation. As demonstrated in the paper, the proposed technique allows us to maintain constant envelope signaling throughout the signaling chain and does not require complicated signal processing at the relay like its decode-and-forward counterparts. Through analytical and simulation studies, {{we found that the}} BER of PSPF with discriminator detection in Rayleigh fading suffers only a moderate loss in energy efficiency (of 1.5 dB after energy normalization) when compared to its 1 -way relaying counterpart. We consider this loss as acceptable, considering that PSPF improves the transmission efficiency by 33 % and it offers a way to avoid expensive linear power amplifiers and complicated signal processing at the relay. We also found that, in comparison with its decoded and <b>forward</b> <b>counterparts,</b> the proposed PSPF scheme offers a lower BER, {{while at the same time}} relieves the relay from performing unnecessary demodulation and re-modulation tasks.|$|E
40|$|The extinct ocean-going plesiosaurs were unique within {{vertebrates}} {{because they}} used two flipper pairs identical in morphology for propulsion. Although fossils of these Mesozoic marine reptiles {{have been known}} {{for more than two}} centuries, the function and dynamics of their tandem-flipper propulsion system has always been unclear and controversial. We address this question quantitatively {{for the first time in}} this study, reporting a series of precisely-controlled water tank experiments that use reconstructed plesiosaur flippers scaled from well-preserved fossils. Our aim was to determine which limb movements would have resulted in the most efficient and effective propulsion. We show that: Plesiosaur hind flippers generated up to 60 % more thrust and 40 % higher efficiency when operating in harmony with their <b>forward</b> <b>counterparts,</b> as compared to operating alone, and; The spacing and relative motion between the flippers was critical in governing these increases. The results of our analyses show that this phenomenon was likely present across the whole range of plesiosaur flipper motion and resolves the centuries-old debate about the propulsion style of these marine reptiles, as well as indicating why they retained two pairs of flippers for more than 100 million years...|$|E

40|$|In {{derivatives}} modelling, it {{has often}} been necessary to make assumptions about the volatility of the underlying variable {{over the life of the}} contract. This can involve specifying an exact trajectory, as in the Black and Scholes (1973), Merton (1973) or Black (1976) models; one that depends on the level of the underlying variable as in the local volatility models of Dupire (1994), Derman and Kani (1994) and Rubinstein (1994); or fixing the parameters of a more general stochastic volatility process as in Hull and White (1987) or Heston (1993). These forward-looking assumptions are by their very nature destined to be disproved, and what is more are at odds with the frequent model recalibration that (rightly) takes place in practice. In Carey (2005), the Black-Scholes analytical framework is extended, via the definition of higher-order volatilities and the derivation of moment formulae for the case where they are deterministic. In this paper, we show that the same formulae can be obtained under markedly weaker assumptions, which leave the future volatilities unspecified. Instead, we impose constraints on new, related quantities, which we term "path-conditional forward volatilities. " Under this scheme, the model inputs are no longer the future spot volatilities, but rather their <b>forward</b> <b>counterparts.</b> One consequence, we show, is that contrary to conventional wisdom, the Black-Scholes formula can in principle be used without any reference to future volatility. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{advances}} in fast light transport acquisition have motivated new applications for forward and inverse light transport. While forward light transport enables image relighting, inverse light transport provides new possibilities for analyzing and cancelling interreflections, to enable applications like projector radiometric compensation and light bounce separation. With known scene geometry and diffuse reflectance, inverse light transport {{can be easily}} derived in closed form. However, with unknown scene geometry and reflectance properties, we must acquire and invert the scene’s light transport matrix to undo the effects of global illumination. For many photometric setups {{such as that of}} a projector-camera system, the light transport matrix often has a size of 10 5 × 10 5 or larger. Direct matrix inversion is accurate but impractical computationally at these resolutions. In this work, we explore a theoretical analysis of inverse light transport, relating it to its <b>forward</b> <b>counterpart,</b> expressed {{in the form of the}} rendering equation. It is well known that forward light transport has a Neumann series that corresponds to adding bounces of light. In this paper...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{distributed}} path reservation protocols for multiplexed all-optical interconnection networks. The path reservation protocols negotiate the reservation and establishment of connections that arrive dynamically to the network. These protocols {{can be applied}} to both wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) networks. Two classes of protocols are discussed: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Simulations of multiplexed two-dimensional torus interconnection networks are used to evaluate and compare the performance of the protocols and to study the impact of system parameters, such as the multiplexing degree and the network size, speed, and load, on both network throughput and communication delay. The simulation results show that, in most cases, the backward reservation schemes provide better performance than their <b>forward</b> reservation <b>counterparts...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} Parkes multibeam H I {{survey of the}} Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This survey, which is {{sensitive}} to spatial structure in the range 200 pc to 10 kpc, complements the Australia Telescope Compact survey, which is sensitive to structure in the range 15 – 500 pc. With an rms column density sensitivity of 8 × 1016 cm− 2 for narrow lines and 4 × 1017 cm− 2 for typical linewidths of 40 km s− 1, emission {{is found to be}} extensive well beyond {{the main body of the}} LMC. Arm-like features extend from the LMC to join the Magellanic Bridge and the Leading Arm, a <b>forward</b> <b>counterpart</b> to the Magellanic Stream. These features, whilst not as dramatic as those in the Small Magellanic Cloud, appear to have a common origin in the Galactic tidal field, in agreement with recent 2 MASS and DENIS results for the stellar population. The diffuse gas that surrounds the LMC, particularly at PAs of 90 ◦– 330 ◦, appears to be loosely associated with tidal features, but loosening by the ram pressure of tenuous Galactic halo gas against the outer parts of the LMC cannot be discounted. High-velocity clouds, which lie between the Galaxy and the LMC in velocity and that appear in the ultraviolet spectra of some LMC stars, are found to be associated with the LMC if their heliocentric velocity exceeds approximately + 100 km s− 1. They are possibly the product of energetic outflows from the LMC disc. The H I mass of the LMC is found to be (4. 8 ± 0. 2) × 108 M (for an assumed distance of 50 kpc), substantially more than previous recent measurements.

40|$|Asymmetries are a {{ubiquitous}} {{feature of}} the scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor plasmas in any tokamak and {{are thought to be}} driven primarily by a variety of drift flows, the directions of which reverse with reversal of the main toroidal field.

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} {{backward}} locomotion {{are similar to}} forward locomotion, while other aspects {{are not related to}} their <b>forward</b> <b>counterpart.</b> The backward preferred transition speed (BPTS) has never been directly compared to the energetically optimal transition speed (EOTS), nor has it been compared to the preferred transition speed (PTS) during forward locomotion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the BPTS occurs at the EOTS, and to examine the relationship between the backward and forward preferred gait transition speeds. The preferred backward and forward transition speeds of 12 healthy, young subjects (7 males, 5 females) were determined after subjects were familiarized with forward and backward treadmill locomotion. On a subsequent day, subjects walked backward at speeds of 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 % of the BPTS and ran backward at speeds of 60, 75, 90, 100, and 120 % of the BPTS while VO 2 and RPE data were collected. After subtracting standing VO 2, exercise VO 2 was normalized to body mass and speed. For each subject, energy-speed curves for walking and running were fit to the normalized data points. The intersection of these curves was defined as the EOTS which was compared to the BPTS using a paired t-test (p < 0. 05). RPE and VO 2 at the BPTS were also compared between walking and running conditions, and the correlation between BPTS and PTS was calculated. The EOTS (1. 85 ± 0. 09 m·s- 1) was significantly greater than the BPTS (1. 63 ± 0. 11 m·s- 1). Even though RPE was equal for walking and running at the BPTS, VO 2 was significantly greater when running. There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 82) between the BPTS and the PTS. Similar to forward locomotion, the determinants of the BPTS must include factors other than metabolic energy. The gait transition during backward locomotion exhibits several similarities to its forward counterpar...|$|R

40|$|We {{define the}} Diverse Action Manipulation (DAMA) problem {{in which we}} are given a mobile robot, a set of movable objects, and a set of diverse, {{possibly}} non-prehensile manipulation actions, and the objective is to find a sequence of actions that moves each of the objects to a goal configuration. We argue that classic sampling-based techniques cannot solve DAMA problems because of the need to move through lower-dimensional subspaces, and we give two sampling-based algorithms for this problem, DARRT and DARRTCONNECT, based on the RRT and RRTCONNECT algorithms respectively. We also show that the DAMA problem can be framed as a multi-modal planning problem [14] and describe a hierarchical algorithm, DARRTH (CONNECT), that takes advantage of this multi-modal nature. This algorithm finds a high-level sequence of transfer manipulations by planning a path only for objects in the domain. It then attempts to achieve each transfer manipulation individually. We present experimental results for all four algorithms for a set of nine problems in two complicated mobile manipulation domains. We show that the bi-directional algorithms are faster than their <b>forward</b> search <b>counterparts</b> and that the hierarchical algorithms perform better than the monolithic searches. We also formally define the conditions under which DARRT is exponentially convergent and prove that these conditions hold for two example manipulation domains, one of which includes nonprehensile manipulation. by Jennifer L.

40|$|We {{present an}} exact result for the non-adiabatic {{transition}} probability {{and hence the}} defect density in the final state of a one-dimensional Kitaev model following a slow quench of the parameter J_-, which estimates the anisotropy between the interactions, as J_-(t) ∼ -|t/τ|. Here, time t goes from -∞ to +∞ and τ defines {{the rate of change}} of the Hamiltonian. In other words, the spin chain initially prepared in its ground state is driven by changing J_- linearly in time up to the quantum critical point, which in the model considered here occurs at at t= 0, reversed and then gradually decreased to its initial value at the same rate. We have thoroughly compared the reverse quenching with its <b>counterpart</b> <b>forward</b> quenching i. e., J_-∼ t/τ. Our exact calculation shows that the probability of excitations is zero for the wave vector at which the instantaneous energy gap is zero at the critical point J_-= 0 as opposed to the maximum value of unity in the forward quenching. It is also shown that the defect density in the final state following a reverse quenching, we propose here, is nearly half of the defects generated in the forward quenching. We argue that the defects produced when the system reaches the quantum critical point gets redistributed in the wave vector space at the final time in case of reverse quenching whereas it keeps on increasing till the final time in the forward quenching. We study the entropy density and also the time evolution of the diagonal entropy density {{in the case of the}} reverse quenching and compare it with the forward case.
