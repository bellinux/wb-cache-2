25|$|Vettel got {{ahead of}} Kvyat at the Senna chicane for fifth on lap 37. Ricciardo's front-left {{suspension}} {{began to move}} unsteadily on the main straight on lap 39, and entering the Senna chicane, his car veered right. Ricciardo limped back to the pit lane to retire, ending his fifteen-race finishing streak, extending back following the Malaysian Grand Prix. Hülkenberg attacked Bottas entering the Senna chicane and passed Bottas for eighth after forcing him onto the turn's run-off area on lap 42. Räikkönen immediately took advantage and attacked Bottas who defended at {{the outside of the}} Descida do Lago corner before the Ferrari got ahead of Bottas who went wide leaving the turn. Bottas made a pit stop on lap 44 which proved problematic: one of his mechanics struggled to make a front wing adjustment and Bottas emerged in 16th place. Magnussen was suffering worse tyre degradation than teammate Button and came under attack from Alonso on lap 45, who moved to the outside lane heading towards the Senna chicane but was unable to pass. The battle continued through the following corners and Magnussen went <b>defensive</b> <b>driving</b> into the Descida do Lago turn which compromised his exit and Alonso overtook him around the inside of turn five.|$|E
500|$|Vergne {{was angry}} with d'Ambrosio's <b>defensive</b> <b>driving</b> {{and found the}} manner d'Ambrosio {{performed}} the manoeuvres as not being [...] "acceptable and fair". He described d'Ambrosio's tactics as [...] "totally stupid" [...] and that it prevented him from winning the race and questioned his intelligence. Vergne revealed that d'Ambrosio {{wanted to have a}} conservation about the manoeuvres but Vergne did not wish to speak to him. D'Ambrosio argued that his <b>defensive</b> <b>driving</b> was fair, saying that he was doing his own race. He argued that in the event that the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, felt he was overly aggressive, he would be notified and issued a warning D'Ambrosio said that from his point of view, he steered into the corner early and argued that he did not change his line: [...] "Sure, I didn’t give much space but this is racing. I understand it can be frustrating but everyone is doing their own race and it’s what the fans want to see.” He felt he could have achieved a maximum finishing position of fifth but the energy targets displayed on his steering wheel dashboard did not match those provided to him by Dragon, which caused him to push hard until his team realised they were mistaken. Vergne changed his verdict on the clash weeks later after admitting he was not aware that d'Ambrosio had incorrect information relayed to him and felt he had performed [...] "a great race". [...] "Things like this can happen. I don't think there are any more worries about it", he said.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>defensive</b> {{medicine}} in <b>driving</b> up {{health care costs}} is hotly contended. Physicians and health policy experts in particular tend to have sharply divergent views on the subject. Physicians argue that defensive medicine is a significant driver of health care cost inflation. Policy analysts, on the other hand, observe that malpractice reform, by itself, will probably not do much to reduce costs. We argue that both answers are incomplete. Ultimately, malpractice reform is a necessary but insufficient component of medical cost containment. The evidence suggests that defensive medicine accounts for a small but non-negligible fraction of health care costs. Yet the traditional medical malpractice reforms that many physicians desire will not assuage the various pressures that lead providers to overprescribe and overtreat. These reforms may, nevertheless, be necessary to persuade physicians to accept necessary changes in their practice patterns {{as part of the}} larger changes to the health care payment and delivery systems that cost containment requires...|$|R
40|$|A {{worldwide}} awakening to {{the high}} incidence of preventable harm resulting from medical care, combined with pressure on hospitals and physicians from liability litigation, has turned international attention to the need for better structures to resolve medical disputes in a way that promotes medical safety and honesty toward patients. The civil justice system in the United States, in particular, is criticized as inefficient, arbitrary, and sometimes punitive. It is charged with undermining sound medical care by encouraging wasteful expenditures through <b>defensive</b> medicine; by <b>driving</b> information about medical mistakes underground where it escapes analysis, undercutting quality improvement efforts; and by forcing physicians in liability-prone specialties such as obstetrics out of practice. Similar charges are leveled against medical injury compensation systems in the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere. While these criticisms have been strongly countered, they have gained a foothold in the public imagination sufficient to place structural reform of medical litigation on the American political agenda. One enlightened response to mounting concerns over medical error and liability has been a partial shift in focus, in the United States and other Western nations, from the blameworthiness of individual physicians to the correction of system-related deficiencies in the quality of care, and from confrontational litigation between patients and health care providers to a more integrative approach emphasizing disclosure to patients and families of the underlying facts and apology for harm done. Drawing in considerable measure on Wagatsuma and Rosett 2 ̆ 7 s pioneering 1986 article explaining the importance of apology (in non-medical settings) in Japan, the scholarship in this area portrays honest disclosure as more than an ethical and professional duty, and sincere apology as more than a way of fulfilling the emotional needs of patients, families, and medical personnel. These scholars, and the 2 ̆ 2 Sorry Works! 2 ̆ 2 movement that their writing has spurred, also assert that contrary to long-standing assumptions of liability insurers and hospital defense lawyers, disclosure and apology have in fact the practical benefit of diffusing some of the dissatisfaction that leads to compensation claims, thereby potentially shrinking liability burdens. While its likely effects on lawsuit filings are contested, the disclosure-and-apology philosophy is gaining considerable traction in medical practice. Compared with the United States, Japan (like most countries) enjoys a comparatively low rate of civil litigation over medical injury. What accounts for this relative paucity of medical lawsuits? The stereotype of a nation populated by long-suffering victims with a cultural aversion to the assertion of rights has long been punctured. Are there simply fewer medical injuries in Japan, due to the prevalence in hospitals of the strict quality control for which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing enterprises are justly famed? When injury claims do arise, are they quickly resolved through non-punitive, harmony-promoting informal dispute resolution processes employing the traditional social lubricant of apology, as the scholarship drawing on the Wagatsuma-Rosett thesis would presume? Not exactly...|$|R
