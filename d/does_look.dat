25|$|Since King Kong {{was seen}} as the bigger draw (at the time, he was even more popular in Japan than Godzilla), and since Godzilla was still a villain {{at this point in the}} series, it led to the {{decision}} to not only give King Kong top billing but also to present him as the winner of the climactic fight. While the ending of the film <b>does</b> <b>look</b> somewhat ambiguous, Toho confirmed that King Kong was indeed the winner in their 1962–63 English-language film brochure Toho Films Vol. 8, which states in the film's plot synopsis, A spectacular duel is arranged on the summit of Mt. Fuji and King Kong is victorious. But after he has won...|$|E

500|$|Populous: The Beginning was {{the first}} in the series {{developed}} with entirely 3D graphics. [...] The game was published more than four years after [...] with developers stating the delay was due to waiting for the hardware specifications to come along enough that they would allow them to do something very different and new.

Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents."

On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. [...] "Looking back at it, it kinda <b>does</b> <b>look</b> like we’re kinda saying we don't {{want to do this}} anymore, but it's not really what we were saying," [...] said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He <b>does</b> <b>look</b> pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

The episode {{focused on a}} fire at the Lassiter's complex which destroys the local pub, hotel, doctor's surgery and coffee shop. Paul's arrival coincidences with the fire which makes him a suspect. His return forms the end of season cliff-hanger and Australian viewers had to wait months before Paul's return continued on-screen. Dennis told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that [...] "judging from his first appearance he certainly <b>does</b> <b>look</b> guilty." [...] He teased that Paul is [...] "very enigmatic" [...] and his motives for committing the crime remain unclear. Dennis professed his love for his character's mysterious agenda but noted that Paul had [...] "grown and matured" [...] during his absence. Producer Peter Dodds believed that Paul's return gave his writers numerous stories. He detailed that it allowed the return of other past characters and [...] "kick-started a whole new web of deceit and lies" [...] within the show. He concluded that it made Neighbours more dramatic ever since.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt it open and [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head because it really <b>does</b> <b>look</b> just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E

[...] The reviewer concluded that [...] "it's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen than getting {{as close as possible to}} the carefree fun on display here." [...] Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said, [...] " [...] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist, or a flick, via an interface that's swiped from your iPhone...It's possibly not the kind of finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been dreaming about, but even they should admit it's a clever conceit." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted {{camera shot}} of Prince, projected against a large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level <b>does</b> <b>look</b> like an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically pixelized Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode. The first [...] "censored" [...] clip was the kickoff show introduction for CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl, with the first two letters of [...] "kickoff" [...] blurred out as if [...] "jackoff" [...] were censored, then with a clip of the shadow of Prince playing guitar with the guitar neck blurred out as if an actual penis were being blurred.|$|E

2500|$|Gun in Your Pocket {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). [...] In {{addition to this}} song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. [...] Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. [...] Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted [...] "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which {{is not on the}} album, which is called Gun in Your Pocket ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was Rubber Medusa, which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) <b>does</b> <b>look</b> like a rubber Medusa so I see why he said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper {{scored the}} PlayStation 3 version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "certainly the best {{version of the}} bunch." [...] Of the controls, he wrote [...] "it doesn't feel as {{rewarding}} or [...] "realistic" [...] as EA would have liked. Really, it just feels like you're suggesting what should happen and then hoping it does." [...] He was also critical of the graphics; [...] "its visuals are simply poor for a next-generation title. Other than the high-definition output, it doesn't look like anything has been noticeably changed. Texture resolution is pretty bad, some of the effects are very last-gen and it really <b>does</b> <b>look</b> like you're playing a PS2 game in HD." [...] He concluded [...] "the game is a strong and rather noticeable improvement over the original release, though much of it does feel outdated on the PlayStation 3. EA {{has done a great}} job of expanding nearly every facet of the game, [...] with last-gen visuals, a frustrating city layout and other issues that plagued the original release, it's still far from perfect." [...] Game Informers Matt Helgeson also scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it still doesn't solve the problems I have with the game as a whole, which remain largely the same." [...] He concluded [...] "The Godfathers uninspired craftsmanship falls short of being a truly compelling game experience." ...|$|E

After {{reflecting}} on what Linus had said, he decides to take the tree home to decorate, to show the others it will work in the play. When he arrives, he stops at Snoopy's decorated doghouse, which now sports a first prize blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He puts an ornamental ball from the doghouse {{on the top of his}} tree. The branch, with the ball still on it, promptly flops over to one side instead of remaining upright, prompting Charlie Brown to declare [...] "I've killed it" [...] and run off in disgust at his perpetual failure. Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang (who have all become guilty for laughing at Charlie Brown) arrive outside Snoopy's doghouse. Linus gently props the drooping branch back in its upright position by wrapping his blanket around the tree. The group add the remaining decorations from Snoopy's doghouse to the tree, and Lucy admits that the tree <b>does</b> <b>look</b> nice. They start humming [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". Charlie Brown returns, surprised at the humming and the redecorated tree, as his peers greet him with a joyous [...] "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!"
