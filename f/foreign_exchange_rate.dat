5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.

For the Bretton Woods system to remain effective, the fix of the dollar to gold would have to be adjustable, or the free market price of gold would have to be maintained near the $35 official foreign exchange price. The larger the gap, known as the gold window, between free market gold price and the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> the more tempting it was for nations to deal with internal economic crises by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it in the gold markets.|$|E
25|$|Except during World War I Afghanistan's <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{has been}} freely {{determined}} by market forces. However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an {{official exchange rate}} which was fixed by the Afghan Central Bank, and a free market exchange rate which {{was determined by the}} supply and demand forces in Kabul's money bazaar called Saraye Shahzada. For example, {{in order to avoid the}} seasonal fluctuations in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e Milli, which was then responsible for the country's exchange rate system and official reserves. Bank-e Milli agreed to exchange afghanis at 4 Afs against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank as the Central Bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although Da Afghanistan Bank tried to keep its official rate close to the Saraye Shahzada's exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war.|$|E

In the second group, the distribution of changes in the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> was close to symmetric except for at least one subperiod.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> variation on the returns and volatility of the stock prices from the Romanian capital market for the period of time January 2000 - December 2012. This period was split in four sub-samples corresponding to different stages of the Romanian financial markets evolution. The GARCH models employed in this investigation provided different results. For the transition period January 2000 - December 2007 we found no evidence of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. During a period of time between the Romania’s adhesion to European Union and the announcement of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy the results indicate a significant impact of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> on the stock returns. For the period from September 2008 to February 2010 we find that <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> influenced not only the stock returns but also their volatility. However, between March 2010 and December 2012 the impact of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market on the Romanian capital market was limited to the returns. We conclude that influence of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> variation on the returns and volatility of the stock prices depended on the factors such as the foreign capitals inflows, the global crisis effects and the perceptions of the national economy. ...|$|R

The results concerning the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swaps were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest <b>rate</b> term structure.
