The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes. Taiko may be either tunable or non-tunable depending on the system used.|$|E
25|$|Mounts that {{accept a}} solid bar {{similar to the}} {{parallel}} mount, but perpendicular to the <b>drum</b> <b>shell</b> or at an angle close to this. Common on older kits, and on some high-level handmade kits from smaller makers.|$|E
25|$|Drum mounts are fittings, {{normally}} {{attached to}} the <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> that enable a drum to be attached to a supporting bracket, stand or rack. Traditionally, smaller tom-tom drums are supported by mounts and known as hanging toms, while snare drums rest on a stand not {{attached to the}} drum, and floor toms and bass drums rest on their own legs.|$|E

5000|$|Craviotto had the {{opportunity}} around 1979-80 {{to work in a}} boatyard with a master boat builder. As an apprentice and helper he began applying this technique to <b>drum</b> <b>shells.</b> So {{with the help of the}} master boat builder, Johnny began making one-ply <b>drum</b> <b>shells.</b> By 1984-85, Craviotto teamed up with Billy Gibson, drummer of Huey Lewis & The News. They launched a drum company, Select Drum Company (later changed to “Solid”) Drum Company.|$|R
5000|$|Trixon also {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of fiberglass <b>drum</b> <b>shells,</b> introducing the [...] "Jet" [...] series in 1968. These single-headed drums featured an internal parabolic baffle which radiated the sound through concentric openings.|$|R
25|$|The {{parallel}} mount {{accepts a}} solid bar {{parallel to the}} <b>drum</b> <b>shell.</b> There are many bar sizes and profiles, mostly either round and knurled or hexagonal. There is a some compatibility, {{but it is not}} universal. Some manufacturers such as Tama Drums and Gibraltar Hardware even produce a single fitting that can be used either singly as a hanging tom mount, or in sets of three to attach the floor tom legs.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{determine}} the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape {{and construction of}} the <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums are constructed and tuned differently.|$|E
2500|$|The Pearl 7/8" [...] (22mm) mount {{accepts a}} 22mm steel tube {{perpendicular}} to the <b>drum</b> <b>shell.</b> The excess length of the tube intrudes through the <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> and a large hole is required for this. Developed by Pearl, this mount has been adopted by many other manufacturers, and the 22mm tube has become a standard interface for many other mounts and stands, such as cymbal booms.|$|E
50|$|Octoban <b>drum</b> <b>shells</b> {{from other}} {{manufacturers}} are of varying lengths, and made from materials like fiberglass, acrylic, aluminum, and wood. Some people {{build their own}} octobans out of PVC or similar commercial tubing.|$|R

50|$|Ease {{of working}} and good {{acoustic}} properties also make limewood popular for electric guitar and bass bodies and for wind instruments such as recorders. Percussion manufacturers sometimes use tilia as a material for <b>drum</b> <b>shells,</b> both {{to enhance their}} sound and for their aesthetics.|$|R
2500|$|A drum [...] "hoop" [...] or [...] "rim" [...] {{may be made}} of metal, wood, {{or other}} {{material}} and is used to hold a drumhead against a <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> either with bolts through metal [...] "claws" [...] attached directly to a hoop, or bolts through holes in a flanged rim. The bolts, called [...] "tension rods", are screwed into threaded [...] "lugs" [...] attached to the <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> in order to tighten and tune the drumhead. A [...] "drum key" [...] is a four sided wrench used to screw the tension rods into the lugs.|$|E
2500|$|While not {{required}} for operation, most drum manufacturers label their products {{by way of}} a drum [...] "badge". The badge is a label attached to the <b>drum</b> <b>shell</b> with a grommet, which is embossed with the manufacturer's name or logo, and often a serial number as well. The grommet doubles as a [...] "vent" [...] hole for two-sided drums.|$|E
2500|$|In a drum kit, {{the bass}} drum {{is much smaller}} than in the {{traditional}} orchestral use, most commonly [...] in diameter. Sizes range from [...] in diameter while depths range for , with [...] being normal. The standard bass drum size of past years was , with [...] being the current standard. Many manufacturers are now popularizing the 'power drum' concept as with tom-toms, with an [...] depth (22×18in) to further lower the drum's fundamental note. This is a misconception however, since the frequency of vibration and hence the fundamental note of a drum {{is determined by the}} diameter of the drum and not by the depth. The <b>drum</b> <b>shell</b> wall thickness, material and wood grain directions, because of alterations in the shell tension, also affects the fundamental note. The thinner wall in wooden ply constructed shells usually produces lower tone, because there are less horizontal grained wood, giving the shell less tension. A wider drum with a larger head would be capable of a lower tuning. Shorter <b>drum</b> <b>shell,</b> however, does not require as much force to vibrate the drum heads.|$|E

50|$|As in the 1970s, {{changes in}} oil prices impact the price of {{acrylics}} and hence the cost of <b>drum</b> <b>shells</b> made from them. As cited above, Ludwig references the oil shock of the late 1970s (and the impact it had on material costs and subsequent product pricing) {{as one of the}} main reasons original Vistalite production ended in 1979.|$|R
2500|$|Broadkaster Series - Endeavors to be a {{faithful}} {{reproduction of the}} Gretsch 3 ply sound of Broadkasters made in their original Brooklyn factory. They are Handcrafted in Ridgeland, South Carolina, USA. [...] Gretsch {{has a long history}} producing 3-ply drum shells, beginning in the 1920s in Brooklyn, New York when the company first engineered the laminate <b>drum</b> <b>shell.</b> [...] Those shells were a 3-ply mix of maple/gum (or poplar)/maple, made without reinforcement hoops and were rounder, lighter and regarded by many as more musical than other shells typically found during that time period. [...] As part of their flagship drums, Gretsch offered the original Broadkaster drums between the 1930s-1950s. [...] Gretsch continued to produce that basic 3-ply Broadkaster shell through the mid-late 1950s, while experimenting with various bearing edges, including a “reverse roundover” beveled edge. [...] Sonically, the classic 1950s 3-ply shells are known for their organic, woody tones with low frequency thump.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} at least one {{practical}} application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size woofer placed closely in front of a [...] "kick drum" [...] (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. [...] A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a [...] woofer shock-mounted into a 10" [...] <b>drum</b> <b>shell</b> used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. Less commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a tweeter is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the STC microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>shell</b> {{is made of}} hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, {{though many}} woods may be in use {{depending}} on the region where the drum is made. [...] To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. [...] The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. [...] However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. [...] Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. [...] Rope threaded {{back and forth across}} the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. [...] Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. [...] Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.|$|E
5000|$|The Lambeg <b>drum's</b> <b>shell</b> is {{generally}} made of oak. Lambeg drum heads are goat skins, {{they are very}} thin and strong, and of even thickness and consistency all over as far as possible. A Lambeg skin will also receive [...] "special" [...] treatment that is a secret to each maker. Because of their qualities they are also sometimes used for smaller drums such as bodhráns.|$|R

50|$|As Stone's renown as {{a teacher}} increased, the George B. Stone & Son drum {{manufacturing}} business began to decline. The factory closed in the late 1930s and the equipment was idle until 1950 when Ralph Eames purchased it, using it to make Eames rope-tensioned parade drums. Today, some of Stone's equipment is still used by the Eames Drum Company in Saugus, MA, {{in the manufacture of}} its <b>drum</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{components}} that make up a drum's anatomy. Some of these anatomical components vary dependent upon the type of drum, the manufacturer, and the year in which it was made. However, nearly all modern drums have the same essential components. Kick drums often have legs called [...] "spurs" [...] {{on either side of the}} <b>drum</b> <b>shell.</b> These spurs are used to prevent the kick drum from rolling side to side, to prevent the drum from sliding forward as it is being played and to provide overall added stability to the drum. Casings, also known as lugs, vary in shape and size. They all serve the same purpose as the receiving end of the drum tension rod (also known as a tuning screw) and provide the anchor point for the tension rods themselves. Casings are found on nearly all modern drums. The number of casings a drum has can vary from drum to drum and manufacturer to manufacturer. A drum can have as little as six casings and as many as twelve. Tension rods, also known as tuning screws, are threaded bolts that are placed around the rim of a drum and screw into the casings. They enable the musician tp adjust the tension of the drum's head and effect it's overall pitch, tone, and timbre. They come in many lengths and should also always have a tension rod washer that is often made of metal or hard plastic.|$|E

50|$|Mahogany also resists wood rot, {{making it}} {{attractive}} in boat construction. It is a tonewood, {{often used for}} musical instruments, particularly the backs, sides and necks of acoustic guitars, electric guitar bodies, and <b>drum</b> <b>shells</b> because {{of its ability to}} produce a very deep, warm tone compared to other commonly used woods such as maple or birch. Guitars featuring mahogany in their construction include Martin D-18, select Taylor Guitars, Gibson Guitars.|$|R
5000|$|Classic corps drum {{lines of}} the 1950s and 1960s used fewer exotic {{percussion}} instruments and relied instead on the stadium-filling power of a traditional line (or [...] "battery") consisting of six or eight 12 in by 15 in double-tension maple snare and tenor <b>drum</b> <b>shells</b> and two or occasionally three 26 in by 12 in bass drums with an ornamental shell covering of hard plastic in a glossy sparkle or pearlescent finish.|$|R
5000|$|The wood {{is often}} used by luthiers for harps and other instruments, such as bass guitars, because of its mellow and well-rounded sound.
