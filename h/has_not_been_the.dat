However, both male and female models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons. Attitudes toward male nudity, issues of homosexuality when male artists work from male models, and some bias towards the female form in art may lead to less opportunity for male models, and works of art that include male nudity are much less marketable.

25|$|Specified {{complexity}} is {{an argument}} proposed by Dembski and used by him in his works promoting intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept is intended to formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both specified and complex.

The concept of specified complexity {{is widely regarded as}} mathematically unsound and <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology.
