40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the process of}} thermochemical wood waste processing in to dimethyl ether. The physical picture {{of the process of}} waste wood recycling was compiled and studied and the mathematical model in the form of differential and algebraic equations with initial and boundary conditions was developed on its basis. The mathematical model allows to determine the optimum operating parameters of synthesis gas producing process, suitable for the catalytic synthesis of dimethyl ether and to calculate the basic constructive parameters of the <b>equipment</b> <b>flowsheet...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of a pilot plant {{for the production of}} electrolytic chromium from low-grade domestic ores is discussed, with emphasis on the techniques necessary to produce an adequately pure chromic sulfate electrolyte from the mixture of metal sulfates obtained by acid dissolution of the ore. <b>Equipment</b> <b>flowsheets</b> are included with a discussion of the materials of construction. Since publication of the original paper, improvements {{have been made in the}} electrodeposition step to increase the current efficiency and decrease the impurities in the metal. Typical operating data are tabulated for each operation...|$|R

Block flow diagrams, <b>equipment</b> <b>flowsheets,</b> and stream material balances are included. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} the process, additional research and development necessary, {{and history of the}} process are also discussed. This report is one of a series describing various processes for converting plutonium nitrate to oxide.

Each is described below, with a special focus on pulsed columns and centrifugal extractors, which {{have been the subject}} of an extensive R&D program by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). Various models have been developed to simulate <b>equipment</b> behavior and <b>flowsheets.</b> The excellent results obtained during industrial operation of the UP 3 and UP 2 - 800 plants in La Hague have confirmed the validity of the choices made during the design phases and pave the way for future improvement of the reprocessing process, from a technical and a financial standpoint...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Unsaturated, nitrogenated and sulfured {{compounds}} {{may reach}} undesirable levels in lubricant base oils, requiring hydrotreatment (HDT) at high temperatures and pressures. HDT processes {{are well known}} for their high capital and operational costs due {{to the use of}} hydrogen, compressors and multistage heterogeneous reactors. Process costs are thus highly dependent on the applied conditions. An oversized process entails unnecessary costs and capital investment. On the other hand, mild reaction conditions lead to unspecified products. This work analyzes the process using a compositional modeling and a kinetic framework developed previously (Barbosa et al., 2002) for the HDT of lubricant base oils. The industrial reactor is rigorously modeled on an adiabatic and multistage configuration. For the remaining <b>equipment</b> in the <b>flowsheet,</b> we adopt shortcut models for compressors and exchangers. The process is then optimized in terms of its variables subject to product specification constraints...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess via techno-economic and {{environmental}} metrics the production of methanol (MeOH) using H 2 and captured CO 2 as raw materials. It evaluates the potential of this type of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) plant on (i) the net reduction of CO 2 emissions and (ii) the cost of production, in comparison with the conventional synthesis process of MeOH Europe. Process flow modelling is used to estimate the operational performance and the total purchased <b>equipment</b> cost; the <b>flowsheet</b> is implemented in CHEMCAD, and the obtained mass and energy flows are utilised as input to calculate the selected key performance indicators (KPIs). CO 2 -based metrics are used to assess the environmental impact. The evaluated MeOH plant produces 440 ktMeOH/yr, and its configuration is the result of a heat integration process. Its specific capital cost is lower than for conventional plants. However, raw materials prices, i. e. H 2 and captured CO 2, do not allow such a project to be financially viable. In order to make the CCU plant financially attractive, the price of MeOH should increase in a factor of almost 2, or H 2 costs should decrease almost 2. 5 times, or CO 2 should have a value of around 222 €/t, under the assumptions of this work. The MeOH CCU-plant studied can utilise about 21. 5 % of the CO 2 emissions of a pulverised coal (PC) power plant that produces 550 MWnet of electricity. The net CO 2 emissions savings represent 8 % of the emissions of the PC plant (mainly due to the avoidance of consuming fossil fuels as in the conventional MeOH synthesis process). The results demonstrate that there is a net but small potential for CO 2 emissions reduction; assuming that such CCU plants are constructed in Europe to meet the MeOH demand growth and the quantities that are currently imported, the net CO 2 emissions reduction could be of 2. 71 MtCO 2 /yr...|$|R
