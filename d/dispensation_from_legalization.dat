40|$|Government {{prohibition}} of drugs {{is the subject}} of ongoing debate. One issue in this debate is the effect of prohibition on government budgets. Prohibition entails direct enforcement costs and prevents taxation of drug production and sale. This report examines the budgetary implications of legalizing drugs. The report estimates that legalizing drugs would save roughly $ 44. 1 billion per year in government expenditure on enforcement of prohibition. $ 30. 3 billion of this savings would accrue to state and local governments, while $ 13. 8 billion would accrue to the federal government. Approximately $ 12. 9 billion of the savings would results <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of marijuana, $ 19. 3 billion <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of cocaine and heroin, and $ 11. 6 <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of other drugs. The report also estimates that drug legalization would yield tax revenue of $ 32. 7 billion annually, assuming legal drugs are taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco. Approximately $ 6. 7 of this revenue would result <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of marijuana, $ 22. 5 billion <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of cocaine and heroin, and $ 3. 5 <b>from</b> <b>legalization</b> of other drugs...|$|R

He received a provisional release in May 1965 and a <b>dispensation</b> <b>from</b> his vows of poverty and obedience on June 30, 1965 (cf. qualified exclaustration). After 25 years as a Jesuit, he left Rome suddenly in July. Even if dispensed from his religious vow of chastity, he remained under the obligation of chastity if still an ordained secular priest. Martin maintained that he remained a priest, {{saying that he had}} received a <b>dispensation</b> <b>from</b> Paul VI to that effect. His critics disagreed.|$|R

While married deacons whose wives die are sometimes permitted to marry again, and married ministers of a non-Catholic confession who become Catholics are sometimes permitted to be ordained and minister in the Catholic Church, grants of <b>dispensation</b> <b>from</b> {{the obligation of}} celibacy without simultaneous laicization are very rare.|$|R

50|$|Religious vows such {{as those}} of Jesuits include that of chastity, but a {{religious}} priest dispensed from them is still bound by the obligation of chastity that is attached to his priesthood, unless he is also laicized, which usually includes <b>dispensation</b> <b>from</b> the obligation imposed by law of celibacy. When a priest of a religious institute becomes a secular priest he must first find a bishop willing to accept him {{as a member of the}} clergy of his diocese.
