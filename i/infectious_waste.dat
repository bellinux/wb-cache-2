The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of manure and urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as foot rot due to the constant wet exposure. The manure and urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially <b>infectious</b> <b>waste.</b> Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of antibiotics to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to antibiotic resistance for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.|$|E

The present study was done to recognize {{the quality and quantity}} of the different generated wastes at various parts of the Faculty of Dentistry-Babol University of Medical Sciences. Methods: The whole solid wastes generated in the odd and even days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) of the middle of the week from the second month of each season were examined. Various dental solid <b>wastes</b> including general, <b>infectious</b> and hazardous chemical wastes were weighted by typical scale. Results: The generation rate of the solid wastes were: total dental wastes: 291. 2 kg including general solid wastes: 251. 3 kg (% 86. 3), <b>infectious</b> <b>wastes</b> and sharps: 38 kg (% 13) and hazardous chemical waste: 2 kg (% 0. 7).

Selection of new suitable locations and finding the optimal set of transport routes for a fleet of vehicles to transport <b>infectious</b> <b>waste</b> material, location routing problem for <b>infectious</b> <b>waste</b> disposal, is one of the major problems in hazardous waste management. Determining locations for <b>infectious</b> <b>waste</b> disposal is a difficult and complex process, because it requires combining both intangible and tangible factors. Additionally, it depends on several criteria and various regulations. This facility location problem for <b>infectious</b> <b>waste</b> disposal is complicated, and it cannot be addressed using any stand-alone technique. Based on a case study, 107 hospitals and 6 candidate municipalities in Upper-Northeastern Thailand, we considered criteria such as infrastructure, geology and social & environmental criteria, evaluating global priority weights using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP). After that, a new multi-objective facility location problem model which hybridizes fuzzy AHP and goal programming (GP), namely the HGP model, was tested. Finally, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) for a case study was formulated, and it was tested using a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) which hybridizes the push forward insertion heuristic (PFIH), genetic algorithm (GA) and three local searches including 2 -opt, insertion-move and interexchange-move. The results show that both the HGP and HGA can lead to select new suitable locations and to find the optimal set of transport routes for vehicles delivering <b>infectious</b> <b>waste</b> material. The novelty of the proposed methodologies, HGP, is the simultaneous combination of relevant factors that are difficult to interpret and cost factors in order to determine new suitable locations, and HGA can be applied to determine the transport routes which provide a minimum number of vehicles and minimum transportation cost under the actual situation efficiently in this case...|$|E
