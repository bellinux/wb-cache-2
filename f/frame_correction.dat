This videotape, filmed at Dealey Plaza, Dallas, developed out of the groups' dynamic that shared an interest in executing the [...] "forbidden idea". The actors involved rehearsed extensively to ensure verisimilitude, and when they performed the reenactment, it was executed with a striking attention to detail. The collectives had no permits for the piece, but were still able to get multiple takes of the performance. This piece {{can be seen as}} a commentary on the pervasive media culture in America, as it explores how the Kennedy assassination itself became a new type of media event.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the near phoria measurement using the Bernell muscle balance card {{with and without}} prism neutralization, using both trial frame and phoropter correction, and compared with the conventional Maddox rod method. Methods: Forty young normal Chinese adults had their near phoria measured with trial <b>frame</b> <b>correction</b> using the conventional muscle balance card method (method 1). Any deviation was compensated with a prism bar as an alternative approach (method 2). The conventional Maddox rod method (method 3) was also carried out for comparison. These three methods were repeated with phoropter correction and considered as methods 4, 5 and 6. Results: The phorias obtained from these six methods {{were not significantly different}} from each other (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0. 05). More than half of the subjects were exophoric. Although the difference in phoria was not significant, phoria measurement using phoropter correction yielded a greater coefficient of variation. Conclusions: Near phoria measurement using the muscle balance card conducted with trial <b>frame</b> <b>correction</b> was less variable, and was also more natural and similar to a real reading situation. The use of prism for compensation did not affect the phoria results. Exophoria seems to be more common than esophoria in young Chinese adults. School of Optometr...|$|E

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} {{a series}} of 56 consecutive patients treated by the Ilizarov circular fixator for various combinations of nonunion, malunion and infection of fractures. We used segmental excision, distraction osteogenesis and gradual correction of the deformity as appropriate. Treatment was effective in eliminating 40 out of 46 nonunions and all 22 infections. There were two cases of refracture some months after removal of the frame, both of which healed securely in a second <b>frame.</b> <b>Correction</b> of malunion was good in the coronal plane {{but there was a}} tendency to anterior angulation, often occurring in the regenerate bone rather than at the original fracture site, after removal of the frame. This was associated with very slow maturation of regenerate bone in some patients, occurring largely, but not exclusively, in those who smoked heavily. Patients expressed high levels of satisfaction with the outcome, despite relatively modest improvements in pain and function, presumably because their longstanding and intractable nonunion had been treated. None the less, the degree of satisfaction correlated strongly with the degree of improvement in pain and function. We emphasise the importance of a multidisciplinary team in the assessment and support of patients undergoing long and demanding treatment. The Ilizarov method is valuable, but research is needed to overcome the problems of delayed maturation of the regenerate and slow or insecure healing of the docking site...|$|E

40|$|Acquisition of cone-beam CT (CBCT) {{concurrent}} with VMAT {{results in}} scatter of the megavoltage (MV) beam onto the kilovoltage (kV) detector deteriorating CBCT image quality. The {{aim of this}} paper is to develop a method to estimate and correct for MV scatter reaching the kV panel. The correction method is based on an alternating pulse sequence such that the kV source is enabled in only every other frame. MV scatter, noise and artifacts in the kV-unexposed frames are separated based on their spatial and temporal frequency characteristics and subsequently subtracted from the exposed frames. The method was tested on a phantom and one lung cancer patient scanned on an Elekta Synergy system simultaneous with a 9 Gy VMAT delivery. Without correction, acquisition during VMAT leads to significant cupping and loss of bone contrast. The novel method removes the signal due to MV scatter. Compared to acquisition without MV beam, the reconstruction quality is identical except for some unavoidable noise due to the scattered MV radiation in the exposed <b>frames.</b> <b>Correction</b> is performed in-line with acquisition without introducing delays. A novel, efficient and effective method was developed to correct for MV scatter in CBCT scans acquired concurrent with rotational radiotherap...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} optimal assembly of the computer assisted Ortho-SUV <b>Frame</b> for <b>correction</b> of the distal femur deformities which will provide the maximal bone fragments mutual movements and have the minimal assembly sizes. For it 360 bench tests on 12 model was performed. The dependence of the Ortho-SUV Frame reduction capabilities (translation, angulation, torsion) and distance between supports, places of struts fixation and use of Z-shaped plates for struts fixation was investigated. It is found that in Ortho-SUV assembling to provide the necessary requirements 3 / 4 ring supports is reasonable. Distal support should be placed at the level VII, proximal at the distance 150 – 200 mm higher. For fixation of the strut 1 to the proximal support position 2 should be used, for the strut 3 – the place between position 5 and 6, for strut 5 – position 10; for fixation of the strut 2 to the distal support position 4 should be used, for fixation of the strut 4 – position 8, for strut 6 – position 12. Use of the Z-shaped plates in fixation of strut 1 and 5 increases the reduction capabilities on 11. 4 – 25. 5 % in average.

40|$|The {{dystrophin}} deficiency {{leading to}} the severely progressing muscle degeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients is caused by frame-shifting mutations in the DMD gene. We are developing a reading <b>frame</b> <b>correction</b> therapy aimed at the antisense-induced skipping of targeted exons from the pre-mRNA. Despite introducing a (larger) deletion, an in-frame transcript is generated that allows the synthesis of a slightly shorter, but largely functional dystrophin as found in the mostly milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). We have recently demonstrated both the efficacy and,high efficiency of the antisense-induced skipping of numerous exons from the DMD transcript in, control muscle cells. In principle, this would restore the reading frame in over 75 % of the patients reported in the Leiden DMD mutation database. In this study, we in fact demonstrate the broad therapeutic applicability of,this strategy in cultured muscle cells from six DMD patients carrying different deletions and a nonsense mutation. In each case, the specific skipping of the targeted exon was induced, restoring dystrophin synthesis in over 75 % of cells. The protein was detectable as soon as 16 h post-transfection, then increased to significant levels at the membrane within 2 days, and was maintained {{for at least a}} week. Finally, its proper function was further suggested by the restored membranal expression of four associated proteins from the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method to correct dark current at relatively high temperatures for Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) images when dark frames cannot be obtained on the telescope. For images taken with the Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST 3) in 2012, due to the low cooling efficiency, the median CCD temperature was - 46 ^∘C, resulting in a high dark current level of about 3 e^-/pix/sec, even comparable to the sky brightness (10 e^-/pix/sec). If not corrected, the nonuniformity of the dark current could even overweight the photon noise of the sky background. However, dark frames {{could not be obtained}} during the observing season because the camera was operated in frame-transfer mode without a shutter, and the telescope was unattended in winter. Here we present an alternative, but simple and effective method to derive the dark current frame from the scientific images. Then we can scale this dark frame to the temperature at which the scientific images were taken, and apply the dark <b>frame</b> <b>corrections</b> to the scientific images. We have applied this method to the AST 3 data, and demonstrated that it can reduce the noise to a level roughly as low as the photon noise of the sky brightness, solving the high noise problem and improving the photometric precision.
