5|$|Once {{placed in}} the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now {{recognized}} by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae {{on the basis of}} morphological characters, such as a full nictitating membrane, well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower caudal fin lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with the lemon sharks (Negaprion) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} DNA evidence, the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|The {{actinide}} series derives {{its name from}} the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{lift bridge}} {{is the last}} of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
5|$|There were {{formerly}} up {{to seven}} species described, including C. casuarius, C. bicristatus Parks 1935, C. brevicristatus Parks 1935, C. excavatus Gilmore 1923, C. frontalis Parks 1935, and C. intermedius Parks 1923. In 1975 Peter Dodson studied {{the differences between the}} skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs. He found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the gender and age of the animal. Now only one species is recognized for certain, C. casuarius, although C. intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies. It is based on specimen ROM 776, a skull found by Levi Sternberg in 1920 and was named by William Parks in 1923, who had originally named it Stephanosaurus intermedius earlier that year. The specific name of C. intermedius is derived from its apparent <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> according to Parks. C. intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the Campanian than C. casuarius, and the two species are not identical, which supported the separation of them in a 2009 study.|$|E

Both parents alternate between brooding the chick or foraging for food.|$|E
25|$|Those parasites {{living in}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position,</b> being half-ectoparasites and half-endoparasites, are called mesoparasites. For example, the cod worm Lernaeocera branchialis invades the gill tissue of a host fish, but quickly grows a tubelike {{structure}} that cuts through the body tissues until it reaches the fish's heart, through which it robs the host of its blood. The rear end of the parasite remains outside, {{so that it can}} scatter eggs into the water.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliography. This article {{examines}} the impact of organizational and absorptive capacities and networking {{on the performance of}} Argentine software and IT services firms, within an evolutionary theoretical framework. The models estimated show that innovation outcomes depend on quality management, the existence of research and development (R&D) staff and on occupying <b>intermediate</b> <b>positions</b> in the network architecture. Firms' economic performance cannot be assessed using a single set of indicators: whereas productivity is explained by the qualifications of human resources and employment growth by R&D personnel, export probability is associated with obtaining certifications, adopting agile methodologies and occupying <b>intermediate</b> <b>positions</b> in the network architecture. The heterogeneity of business models suggests that {{it is not possible to}} establish a single type of relationship between innovation and performance for all firms in the industry...|$|R
50|$|At <b>intermediate</b> <b>positions,</b> {{pressure}} in the two chambers is balanced and the valve remains part-open. This depends on the piston size, the pressure reduction downstream and the flows through the two control valves. The pilot valve gives a proportional control over main valve flowrate, with the opening being controlled, slow and gradual.|$|R
25|$|The Craterostigmomorpha are {{the least}} diverse {{centipede}} clade, comprising only two extant species, both in the genus Craterostigmus. Their geographic range is restricted to Tasmania and New Zealand. They have a distinct body plan; their anamorphosis comprises a single stage: in their first moult, they grow from having 12 segments to having 15. Their low diversity and <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> between the primitive anamorphic centipedes and the derived Epimorpha has led to them being likened to the platypus. They represent the survivors of a once diverse clade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage of the Corps plan, the {{divisions}} were to occupy higher ground either side of Willow Stream and beyond Mametz on the right, then take Fricourt in the next stage, moving through the first German <b>intermediate</b> <b>position,</b> to the second <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> across the valley fronting Mametz Wood. The right was to gain contact with the XIII Corps at White Trench and the left link with III Corps, at Quadrangle Trench below Contalmaison. The final objective was chosen to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation in front of dead ground, from which the artillery could bombard the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve, would pass through and advance beyond Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mametz and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank on the south rise of Willow Valley, which faced Fricourt and Fricourt Wood to the north. The inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue was}} {{contrived}} that the Protestant party (Du Plessis Mornay) could {{not fail to}} lose. By concurring with this decision, Casaubon confirmed the Protestants' suspicions that, like his friend and patron, Philippe Canaye, he was contemplating abjuration. From then on, he became {{the object of the}} hopes and fears of the two religions; the Catholics lavishing promises and plying him with arguments; the Protestant ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing cause, and only haggling about his price. Neither side could understand that Casaubon's reading of the church fathers led him to adopt an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> between Genevan Calvinism and Ultramontanism.|$|E

25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} {{was controlled}} with three foot pedals and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position,</b> the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional rapid prototyping technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>position</b> rather than returning to the stable equilibrium. The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various metals and alloys, plastics such as Plexiglass, stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. The balancing properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory the balancing properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E

40|$|Both Literalism and Contextualism come in many varieties. There are radical, {{and less}} radical, {{versions}} of both Literalism and Contextualism. Some <b>intermediate</b> <b>positions</b> are mixtures of Literalism and Contextualism. In this paper I describe several literalist positions, several contextualist positions, {{and a couple}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>positions.</b> My aim is to convince the reader that the Literalism/Contextualism controversy is far from being settled. In the first section, I look at the historical development of Literalism. This development reveals a gradual weakening. The question that naturally arises is: How far can we go in this direction? Where will this tendency ultimately lead us? And the obvious answer is: to Contextualism. In the second section I describe the steps which, from a critique of the currently dominant literalist position (Minimalism), can lead to Contextualism. In the last three sections I describe various contextualist positions, and I discuss possible literalist replies to the contextualist challenge...|$|R
