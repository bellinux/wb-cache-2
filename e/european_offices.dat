5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its <b>European</b> <b>offices.</b> Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain, the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed {{that the company had}} violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs, a group to which Burger King belongs, that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food. The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches, averaging over 970 calories each, violated the accord. The head of Spain's food regulatory body, Felix Lobo, stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for [...] "illegally failing to comply with a contract". In a {{response to}} the Government's allegations, the <b>European</b> <b>offices</b> of Burger King released this statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company also explained that it had always worked [...] "to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced... diet." [...] A spokesperson for the company stated that customers have the choice of salads versus a Whopper, that they have the option to modify their sandwiches as they please, and that the company was going to continue to advertising the products.|$|E

[...] The new organization would be based on the [...] "concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life." ...|$|E
