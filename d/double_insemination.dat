40|$|Efficiency of {{artificial}} insemination depends equaly by semen quality {{and time of}} inoculation. The optimal time for inoculation was calculated usually {{from the moment of}} detection of heat, for <b>double</b> <b>insemination,</b> so that one of the two inoculations to approach the time of ovulation. To increase the efficiency of boars exploitation is necesary to change the method to a single insemination. To ensure normal fertility parameters with only one inoculation it is necessary to chose with great precision the moment of insemination,in order to ensure the time for sperm capacitation and penetration of viable oocytes. Starting from the fact that major events such as forrowing and death occur, according to the circadian rhythm, {{in the second half of}} the night, this study aims to detect from this point of view the moment of ovulation, to find a more reliable calculation for the time of semen inoculation. The experiments were conducted on puberal gilts, which were not treated for induction of ovulation; the control for detecting the follicular dehiscence was done only on physiological oestrus. Females having symptoms at heat control were subject to series of laparatomias, complete with collection and examination of oocytes...|$|E

Both lactating cows and virgin dairy heifers were assigned randomly to treatments as repeat breeders, if they had failed to conceive to at least two previous services. Cows inseminated once and treated with GnRH had the best conception rates (41 %), which were higher (P<. OI) than those of cows inseminated once without GnRH treatment (32 %) and higher (P<.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of single versus <b>double</b> intrauterine <b>insemination.</b> Materials and MethodsThis prospective randomized study {{was carried out in}} 100 infertile patients. One intrauterine insemination was applied 36 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection to 50 patients in the first group. To 50 patients in the second group, two intrauterine inseminations were applied, of which the first was applied 24 hours after and the second 48 hours after the hCG injection. ResultsIn the first group, pregnancies were detected in eight patients (pregnancy rate per patient was 16 %, pregnancy rate per cycle was 10. 6 %). In the second group, pregnancies were detected in five patients (pregnancy rate per patient was 10 %, pregnancy rate per cycle was 6. 4 %). There was no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (p> 0. 05). ConclusionSingle intrauterine insemination can be considered to be more reasonable than <b>double</b> intrauterine <b>insemination</b> treatment, taking into consideration the economic cost and the psychologic trauma to the patients.

40|$|Summary &mdash; Virgin queens {{homozygous}} for the recessive cordovan {{body color}} gene were insemi-nated with semen of cordovan drones. The queens {{were divided into}} 4 groups and were treated as follows: 1), inseminated with 8 mm 3 of semen; 2), treated with CO 2 before insemination with 8 mm 3 of semen; 3), inseminated twice with 4 mm 3 of semen; and 4), treated twice with CO 2, ie before and after insemination with 8 mm 3 of semen. Queen excluders {{were removed from the}} entrances after the last treatment. Mating nuclei were placed in the apiary with dominant black drones. The number of emerging cordovan and black workers was determined. Of the queens which were only inseminat-ed once, 50 % mated naturally; however, out of those additionally treated once with CO 2, only 25 % mated. No queen from the 2 other groups mated naturally. The ratio of wild black progeny originating from queens which also mated naturally was on average 33. 4 % for group 1, and 6. 2 % for group 2. Queens from group 1 additionally mated naturally on average with 3 drones per queen, and those from group 2 with only 1 drone per queen. <b>Double</b> <b>insemination</b> with the same total amount of se-men or 2 additional CO 2 treatments prevented additional natural mating of instrumentally inseminat-ed queens. natural mating / instrumental insemination / queen be...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Eriophyoid females store sperm either asymmetrically in one spermatheca, or symmetrically in both spermathecae. Previous {{studies have suggested}} that species in which females store sperm asymmetrically pick up sperm from only one spermatophore, while those with symmetrical sperm storage pick up sperm from two or more spermatophores during their lifetime. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine spermatophore visitation behaviour and symmetry of sperm storage in Aculops allotrichus from the black locust tree and Cecidophyopsis hendersoni from the yucca. This would indicate monandry or poly-andry in these species. In both eriophyoids, the spermatophore visitation consisted of three phases: mounting, lying on the spermatophore and dismounting. Aculops allotrichus stored sperm asymmetrically. However, nearly one-third of the observed females visited two spermatophores, rather than only one in their lives. When A. allotrichus females visited two spermatophores they spent a similar amount of time at the first and at the second visitation. Also, the times of visitation of the first of the two spermatophores and the single spermatophore in a female lifetime did not differ significantly. This would suggest that apart from monandry, <b>double</b> <b>insemination</b> also occurs in this species. By contrast, C. hendersoni females were polyandrous. They stored sperm symmetrically and visited sev-eral spermatophores, on average 1. 54 (max 6) per day, and up to 33 spermatophores in their lives. The benefits of repeated spermatophore visitation and the possible mechanisms of sperm storage in both species are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the pregnancy rate (PR) in goats with natural and synchronized estrus after artificial insemination (AI) by frozen semen during breeding season. Methods: The experiment {{was carried out}} with 89 Bulgarian White milk goats divided as follows: group I (n =  54) animals with natural estrus (NE), allocated in two subgroups treated with or not with GnRH after the last insemination and group II (n =  35) goats with synchronized estrus by intravaginal sponges and injection of PMSG after the sponges withdrawal. Both groups were also divided according to number AI – single or double. All animals in group I were inseminated by frozen semen after proved standing estrus {{as a part of}} goats received second insemination 8  h later. Single insemination in synchronized goats was done 48 and double at 48 and 56  h after the sponge removal. Ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 30 post insemination. Results: The pregnant animals in both subgroups with natural estrus and single AI (33. 3 % and 45. 2 %) were less than those (58. 3 %) after estrus synchronization (ES). The pregnancy rate in synchronized goats with <b>double</b> <b>insemination</b> was 63. 6 %, whereas in animals with natural estrus varied from 40  to 50 %. Overall pregnancy rate in group I (60 %) was significantly (P <  0. 05) higher than (37 %) in goats without GnRH treatment. Conclusion: The goats with natural estrus and GnRH treatment tend to enhance pregnancy rate after double artificial insemination 8  h apart. The insemination number has no significant impact on pregnancy rate in synchronized goats as the overall pregnancy rate is better than in animals with natural estrus without GnRH administration...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{pregnancy}} rates {{with single}} intrauterine <b>insemination</b> (SIUI), <b>double</b> intrauterine <b>insemination</b> (DIUI) and fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP). STUDY DESIGN: Ninety patients undergoing a standard ovarian stimulation regimen were randomized to receive SIUI, DIUI or FSP. The end point was either pregnancy or completion of 3 treatment cycles without pregnancy. RESULTS: There {{were no differences}} in demographic data or ovarian responses. The total number of motile spermatozoa inseminated in the FSP group was significantly lower than in the SIUI group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study and}} compare raw and {{prepared}} semen samples from two consecutive days by conventional sperm parameters, various motility characteristics of spermatozoa determined by computer-aided sperm analysis and calcium ionophore-induced acrosome reaction. STUDY DESIGN: Semen samples of male partners in couples undergoing 81 cycles of <b>double</b> intrauterine <b>insemination</b> were studied. The first sample was produced after abstinence of 2 - 7 {{days and the}} second, 24 hours after the first. Both samples were processed by isolate sperm separation medium. RESULTS: Semen volume, sperm concentration and total motile spermatozoa were significantly reduced in day 2 raw and prepared samples, whereas normal morphology, motility characteristics and percentage of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa increased significantly in day 2 inseminated samples as compared to day 1. Oligospermic, asthenospermic and teratozoospermic samples showed a significant improvement in concentration, various motility characteristics and normal morphology of spermatozoa in day 2 samples as compared to day 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} efficacy of <b>double</b> intrauterine <b>insemination</b> (IUI) over a single periovulatory IUI in patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with low-dose recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) combined with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-four infertile women were randomly assigned to three groups; in group A (38 patients, 47 cycles) a single IUI was performed 36 h after HCG administration combined with timed intercourse the day of HCG administration; within group B (43 patients, 48 cycles) IUI alone was performed 36 h after HCG administration; in group C (39 patients, 43 cycles) a double IUI 12 and 36 h after HCG administration was performed. RESULTS: The mean age and the causes of infertility were similar between the three groups. The number of follicles greater than 15 mm on the day of HCG administration and the overall dose of rFSH required per cycle was not significantly different among the groups. The pregnancy rate (PR) per cycle and per patient was 14. 9 % and 18. 4 % in group A, 10. 4 % and 11. 6 % in group B, 20. 9 % and 23. 1 % in group C, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in PR among the three groups. CONCLUSION: In rFSH/HCG cycles, two IUIs performed 12 and 36 h after HCG administration do not significantly improve pregnancy rates over a single insemination performed 36 h after HCG administration combined with or without timed intercourse the day of HCG administration...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intra uterine {{insemination}} (IUI), with {{or without}} controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), {{is one of the}} treatment modalities offered to couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year (subfertile couples). It has been suggested that increasing the number of inseminations from one per cycle to two might increase the probability of conception. OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is a difference in live birth or pregnancy rates for subfertile couples using single or double intrauterine insemination in stimulated cycles. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility group trials register (searched 8 July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2002), EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2002), SCIENCE Direct Database (January 1966 to July 2002), Confsci (January 1973 to 15 July 2002), Pascal (January 1984 to July 2002) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled, parallel trials of single versus double intrauterine inseminations in simulated cycles in subfertile couples. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies involving 386 women were included. There was no data for the main outcome measure of live birth per couple or ongoing pregnancy rates, and none presented comparative data for adverse events. The results of two studies that reported pregnancy rate per couple did not show a significant effect of using <b>double</b> <b>insemination</b> (Peto OR 1. 45, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 2. 70).

40|$|Background: Intrauterine {{insemination}} (IUI) is {{a commonly}} used procedure {{to increase the}} infertile couples' chance of pregnancy. Single or <b>double</b> <b>insemination</b> and different timing choices are modifications of this intervention. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the effect of the IUI procedure on clinical pregnancy rates when performed at 24  hours or 36  hours after ovulation triggered by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) following ovulation induction with gonadotropins. Methods: One hundred and thirteen women diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (as per Rotterdam's criteria) or unexplained infertility, who were treated using gonadotropins for ovulation induction and IUI for increasing fertilization potential, were recruited from the medical records of the infertility clinic. Demographic features, cycle outcomes, and clinical pregnancy rates of the patients were compared based on two different timing strategies of IUI (24  hours and 36  hours) following ovulation trigger using hCG. Results: Clinical pregnancy rates per cycle were 22. 9 % in the PCOS group and 26. 9 % in the unexplained group. The clinical pregnancy rates according to the timing of IUI were found to be similar for PCOS patients, unlike patients with unexplained infertility whose clinical pregnancy rates were significantly better when the IUI procedure was performed 24  hours following the hCG trigger. The cycle day of hCG trigger was also found to be significantly related to clinical pregnancy rate as utilizing a later hCG trigger day appeared to positively affect the odds of clinical pregnancy establishment. Conclusion: IUI performed at either 24  hours or 36  hours after ovulation triggered by hCG injection does not change clinical pregnancy rates for PCOS patients. Patients with unexplained infertility seem to benefit from earlier IUI procedures, which increases their fertility potential during ovulation induction with gonadotropins. Avoiding earlier than physiologically needed artificial-hCG triggering before IUI procedures results with better pregnancy rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to improve pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI; 35 – 42 d after AI) in virgin Jersey heifers bred by AI of sex-sorted semen after being detected in estrus. Giving 100 μg of GnRH at first detection of estrus, with AI 12 h later, did not affect P/AI in Experiment I [GnRH = 47. 2 % (100 / 212) vs. No GnRH = 51. 7 % (104 / 201); P = 0. 38] or Experiment II [GnRH = 53. 1 % (137 / 258) vs. No GnRH = 48. 6 % (122 / 251); P = 0. 43]. In these two experiments, estrus detection was done with tail-head chalk or a HeatWatch® system, respectively. In Experiment III, a single insemination dose (2. 1 × 106 sperm) 12 h after estrus detection (n = 193), a double dose at 12 h (n = 193), or a double dose involving insemination 12 and 24 h after estrus detection (n = 190) did not affect P/AI (87 / 193 = 45. 1 %, 85 / 193 = 44. 0 %, and 94 / 190 = 49. 5 %, respectively; P = 0. 51).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{some aspects of}} the application of artificial breeding technology to the breeding of Cashmere goats. The development of young male Cashmere and Angora goats was also studied. Experiments were undertaken to develop a simple procedure for freezing caprine semen in polyvinyl straws suspended in liquid nitrogen vapour. Such a methodology was determined and assessed in the laboratory against a more conventional method of freezing semen in pellets on solid carbon dioxide (dry ice). Acceptable rates of sperm survival after freeze-thawing were achieved for the straw freezing procedure. However, sperm survival was greater after freezing semen as pellets. Artificial insemination programs were conducted with the aim of improving fertility from both laparoscopic and cervical insemination procedures in Cashmere goats. The factors examined included the hormonal control of ovulation, the time of insemination relative to ovulation, the number of motile sperm inseminated, the depth of cervical insemination, and the age and parity of the females. Fertility was improved by insemination prior to the estimated time of ovulation, and with increasing depth of cervical insemination. Fertility was reduced in kid maidens compared with both hogget maidens and multiparous adult does. Fertility resulting from the laparoscopic insemination of semen processed and frozen as pellets and straws was also assessed. The fertility achieved with straw frozen semen was not significantly less than from semen frozen in pellets. A method was investigated for production of inseminate containing high densities of motile spermatozoa for use in cervical insemination. This semen was frozen at dilution rates of 1 : 0. 5, and 1 : 1 (Semen:diluent). Whilst the percentage of spermatozoa surviving this process was lower than for conventional dilution rates (1 : 2), the concentration of motile spermatozoa was up to 1. 8 times greater in semen frozen at 1 : 0. 5. There was no benefit to fertility from this technique, although fertility was not significantly reduced. Fertility was not significantly affected by timing of insemination, <b>double</b> <b>insemination</b> or the number of motile sperm inseminated. In addition, a small study was also conducted to examine the affects of breed (Cashmere and Angora), early weaning and foster rearing on the early growth and development of young goat bucks. There was no significant affect of rearing strategy on live weight or testis weight. Testis weight was more closely related to live weight than age in the young buck, and was highly predictable from measures of scrotal circumference. The growth and development of the smaller group of Angoras studied was significantly slower than that of the Cashmeres. Late spermatids and released spermatozoa were observed in 48...|$|E
