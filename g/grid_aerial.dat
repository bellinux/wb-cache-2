5000|$|Intensifying at an [...] "extraordinary" [...] pace, Matthew reached Category 4 {{strength}} by 18:00 UTC. The rapid intensification culminated {{during the}} overnight of September 30 - October 1, with Matthew achieving its peak intensity at Category 5 status by 00:00 UTC on October 1, {{making it the}} first such storm in the Atlantic basin since Felix in 2007. The hurricane's satellite presentation had markedly improved, with cloud tops colder than -80 C in the central dense overcast surrounding a 6 mi wide eye. Throughout the explosive intensification period, Matthew was embedded within a broad region of 21 - 25 mph west-southwesterly wind shear, as calculated by the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) model using a 1000 km <b>aerial</b> <b>grid.</b> Shear of this intensity normally prevents or limits storm intensification. Reduction to a 400 km <b>aerial</b> <b>grid</b> in post-storm analysis revealed significantly lower wind shear at a localized level, calculated at 12 - 17 mph. As {{a result of the}} over-analyzed wind shear, the NHC did not anticipate the magnitude of Matthew's rapid intensification.|$|R
40|$|Mapping the {{environment}} is necessary for navigation in unknown areas with autonomous vehicles. In this context, a method to process depth images for occupancy grid mapping is developed. Input data are images with pixel-based distance information and the corresponding camera poses. A measurement model, focusing on stereo-based depth images and their characteristics, is presented. Since {{an enormous amount of}} range data must be processed, improvements like image pyramids are used so that the image analysis is possible in real-time. Output is a grid-based image interpretation for sensor fusion, i. e. a world-centric occupancy probability array containing information stored in a single image. Different approaches to draw pixel information into a grid map are presented and discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. As a final result, 3 D occupancy <b>grids</b> from <b>aerial</b> image sequences are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The recent {{trend of}} {{integrating}} CRS into hybrid plants with combined cycles {{is creating a}} new situation, since the solar field is forced {{to make use of}} sites near gas pipelines and industrial areas. Land there becomes a signiticant portion of plant cost and constraints lead to some particular problems for layout optimization and subsequent optical performance. The COLON SOLAR heliostat field represented a real ckallenge during the design phase, because of the important restrictions stemming from the available site. Field optimization required adapting the existing codes to the COLON SOLAR site, since the field is not oriented to the North, is narrower than required and presents a number of restrictions associated with industrial pipelines and electrical <b>grids</b> (both <b>aerial</b> and buried) found on the site. Flux distributions on tile absorber surface obtained with HELIOS and DELSOL 3 demonstrated that in any given situation the centroid shifted about 25 " to the East because of the higher number of heliostats to the West. The influence of such peculiarities in the field on design and the minimization of their effect on plant performance are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{dispersion}} {{patterns of}} flying southern pine beetles, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimm., and the clerid predator Thanasimus dubius (F.) were determined within 3 natural infestations of southern pine beetle (SPB) in eastern Texas using grids of sticky traps. There was significant positive {{association of the}} 2 insects throughout the trapping <b>grids,</b> although <b>aerial</b> population densities of the clerid {{were inversely related to}} aerial densities of SPB. Aggregation patterns were quantified using the index of patchiness (lP) and the regressions of mean crowding (m) on mean density (m). Both methods showed a highly clumped pattern for both beetle species. SPB density in the infestations was positively associated with the daily rate of tree attack by the beetles, but the degree of population aggregation in the infestations was inversely related to the daily rate of tree attack. Although densities of the two species did not follow the same trends among the 3 infestations, the degree of aggregation did (i. e., SPB was most highly aggregated in the location where T. dubius was most highly aggregated) and Lloyd 2 ̆ 7 s index of interspecific patchiness indicated overlapping aggregate distributions. A kairomonal response mechanism for T. dubius, and SPB co-aggregation within infestations is hypothesized...|$|R
40|$|Colloque avec actes sans comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceIn {{the frame}} of {{designing}} a knowledge discovery system, we have developed stochastic models based on high-order Hidden Markov Models (HMM 2). These models are capable to map sequences of data into a Markov chain in which the transitions between the states depend on the n previous states according {{to the order of}} the model. We study the process of achieving information extraction from spatial and temporal data by means of an unsupervised classification. We use therefore a French national database related to land use, named Teruti, which describes the land use at two levels of resolution: the first level is defined by a <b>grid</b> of <b>aerial</b> pictures and the second level is defined by 6 x 6 matrices of sites located in the pictures. Land use (wheat, corn, forest, [...] .) is recorded every year on each site. We work with agronomists interested in finding agricultural land use regularities. The temporal segmentation of the data is done by means of second-order HMM that appear to have very good capabilities to locate stationary segments, as shown in our previous work in speech recognition. The spatial classification is performed by defining a fractal scanning of the images {{with the help of a}} Hilbert-Peano curve that introduces a total order on the sites, preserving the relation of neighborhood between the sites. We show that the HMM performs a spatial classification that is meaningful for the agronomists. Spatial and temporal classification is achieved simultaneously by means of 2 level HMM 2 that measures the probability to map a temporal sequence of images onto a set of hidden states...|$|R
40|$|Land Monitor is a multi-agency {{project of}} the Western Australian Salinity Action Plan {{supported}} by the Natural Heritage Trust. It will provide land managers and administrators with baseline salinity and vegetation data for monitoring changes over time, and land height data from which contours accurate to two metre intervals can be produced. The Project will also provide estimates of areas at risk from secondary or future salinisation. Land Monitor will cover the 18 million hectares of agricultural area of south-west, Western Australia. Sequences of calibrated Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images integrated with landform information derived from height data, ground truthing and other existing mapped data sets are {{used as the basis}} for monitoring changes in salinity and woody vegetation. Heights are derived on a 10 m <b>grid</b> from stereo <b>aerial</b> photography flown at 1 : 40, 000 scale, using soft-copy automatic terrain extraction (image correlation) techniques. Proposed Land Monitor products include salinity maps, predicted salinity maps, enhanced imagery, vegetation status maps and spectral / temporal statistics.

40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} photolineaments {{obtained from}} stereoscopic examination of vertical aerial photographs {{and by the}} Ronchi grating study of aerial photoindex sheets. The photolineaments are compared with the trends of oriented fracture systems procured by measuring the compass direction of joints in bedrock. The relative reliability of the methods is shown, {{and the results are}} presented in graphical, tabular, and written form. Analyses of field measurements of strikes of bedrock joints in the project area indicate for the most part two intersecting sets of major joints oriented N 7620 W - N 1520 E, and N 5720 W - N 2720 E. The analyses of lineaments determined by stereoscopic examination of aerial photographs show dominant trends of lineament zones of weakness to be an average of N 6520 W - N 2020 E. Analysis of lineaments found by Ronchi <b>grid</b> viewing of <b>aerial</b> photoindex sheets indicate dominant trends of N 7020 W - N 2720 E. The three methods give similar findings and verify the work of previous authors. The Ronchi grid method is a useful guide, but it cannot be substituted for the two more painstaking methods...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a project that}} is monitoring land condition in the south west of Western Australia using Landsat Thematric Mapper satellite images and terrain data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). Land Monitor is a multi-agency project of the Western Australian Salinity Action Plan supported by the Natural Heritage Trust.

40|$|Power line {{inspection}} ensures the safe {{operation of a}} power transmission <b>grid.</b> Using unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicle (UAV) images of power line corridors is {{an effective way to}} carry out these vital inspections. In this paper, we propose an automatic inspection method for power lines using UAV images. This method, known as the power line automatic measurement method based on epipolar constraints (PLAMEC), acquires the spatial position of the power lines. Then, the semi patch matching based on epipolar constraints (SPMEC) dense matching method is applied to automatically extract dense point clouds within the power line corridor. Obstacles can then be automatically detected by calculating the spatial distance between a power line and the point cloud representing the ground. Experimental results show that the PLAMEC automatically measures power lines effectively with a measurement accuracy consistent with that of manual stereo measurements. The height root mean square (RMS) error of the point cloud was 0. 233 m, and the RMS error of the power line was 0. 205 m. In addition, we verified the detected obstacles in the field and measured the distance between the canopy and power line using a laser range finder. The results show that the difference of these two distances was within ± 0. 5 m...|$|R
40|$|A {{telemetry}} {{system for}} studying decapod crustacean behaviour is described which uses low frequency, digitally encoded electromagnetic tags whose signals are detected with a <b>grid</b> of loop <b>aerials</b> on the seabed. Electromagnetic telemetry {{can be used}} to study short range movements of cryptic animals in topographically complex habitats that are not amenable to ultrasonic telemetry. Digital encoding allows many individuals to be monitored simultaneously and one or more behavioural, physiological or environmental variables to be telemetered. In the present system, tag signals convey identity and a measure of activity derived from an integral tilt switch. Translocational movements are indicated by detection of tags with different aerials. A central data logger located on the seabed decodes and records tag signals and environmental measurements. Design life of tags is > 1 year and the receiving system batteries are replaced by divers at intervals of up to 4 weeks. In field tests, crab (Cancer pagurus L.) and lobster (Homarus gammarus (L.)) activity was monitored at an artificial reef for 14 months. Examples of the type of information acquired are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the system and potential applications are discussed. Limitations of digital electromagnetic telemetry stem mainly from the short range of detection, the need for cables on the seabed and {{the size and shape of}} the transmitting tag...|$|R
