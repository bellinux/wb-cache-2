The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E
2500|$|She {{later told}} The Oregonian, [...] "I {{called the police}} because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> God in the face. I will do {{anything}} {{in my power to}} make sure other people aren't hurt. But right now, he's sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Since Marjory was taken,' {{returned}} Will, 'I declare before God {{you were}} the only friend <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for.' So the pair went arm-in-arm across the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{his face}} while I was takin' the belt off. You can keep your catch if you like. I've no use for mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I told you, my lord, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{after my}} grandmother.' 'Come to-morrow, and I {{will make you}} lady-in-waiting to the Countess,' {{and he went on}} his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{had no such}} effect. Here I am, {{after it}} all, telling you as I used to tell you before, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to you for my happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is possible, señor; {{they would}} {{certainly}} {{do everything they}} could to prevent anyone not in the secret from knowing. The mark <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for first is a serpent. It is carved on a rock {{at the end of a}} valley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was detained, sir," [...] Cluny said, {{dropping}} a curtsey; [...] "my mother is ill, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after {{the children and}} get the dinner before they went away." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I didn’t {{want to live}} a {{life where}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> over my {{shoulder}} all the time, but I still needed to make money. I didn’t want to live in poverty anymore." ...|$|R
60|$|HAROLD. Naturally again; for as I used to transact all his {{business}} for him, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> over his letters. Now then, see these (takes out letters). Half {{a score of}} them, all directed to me--Harold.|$|R

"I shall profit nothing by it," [...] {{said the}} Earl; [...] "my doom is fixed before I start--but if {{this mode of}} {{managing}} the matter will save your conscience, I {{have no objection to}} it--it cannot consume much time, which is what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am different," [...] said Olive; [...] "I am a navy girl, {{and more}} like a man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for myself. I think it is time I was married, and {{therefore}} I am giving the subject attention. Don't you think that is prudent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at things}} in the short run, and I can't see any justice in Marcia's husband using her so!" [...] cried Clara. [...] "Why shouldn't you use me badly? I don't believe that any woman ever meant better by her husband than she did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think if}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the face}} of Codfish while I was eating, it would spoil my appetite," [...] was Andy's comment during the meal. [...] "They ought to {{photograph}} his mouth {{and put it in}} the comic supplements." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Alton rode up at a gallop. [...] "Sorry I couldn't come before, but I was over at Thomson's {{borrowing}} a new trolling spoon," [...] he said. [...] "Jimmy's too slow for anything, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{a span of}} oxen he'd been buying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} if <b>I</b> did? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after myself, <b>I</b> suppose. You forget that I am only here on sufferance, whilst you are {{the son of the}} house. It does not matter to you, but he would have turned me out of doors," [...] whined George.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it is that he expects, or why he should {{interfere}} at all. I can't bear to be interfered with. What does he know about it? He has had somebody to pay everything for him half-a-dozen times, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “My dear,” said Mrs. Attray, “I don’t want {{to offend}} them. After all, they are my landlords and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to them for {{anything}} I want done about the place; they were very accommodating about the new roof for the orchid house. And they lend me one of their cars when mine is out of order; you know how often it gets out of order.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young people," [...] {{answered}} Lord Minster, with {{a superior}} smile, [...] "England is {{quite capable of}} looking after herself. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after myself. She will, at any rate, last my time, and my motto is that one should {{get something out of}} one's country, not attempt to do her services that would in all probability never be recognized, or, if recognized, left unrewarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Whatever {{the wrong}} or deceit was, he did it, I'm sure o' that. <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at 'is face for five {{consecutive}} nights. I'm not so fond o' navigatin' about Cape Town with a South-Easter blowin' these days. I can hear those teeth click, so to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] said Dora, {{preparing}} {{to get down}} from the buggy; [...] "I {{would not want to}} wait for you in that tiresome old horse-hair parlor of the Dudleys. I should ever so much rather sit here, by myself, until you come back. But of course I shall see her before long. Isn't it funny, Herbert? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for her when I came here before, and I suppose <b>I</b> shall always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for her whenever I come." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{as the two}} walked {{together}} to the house, Mr Hall explained {{that there had been}} some little difference in years gone by between old Mr Gordon and himself as to money. [...] "I was very sorry, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after myself. You knew nothing about it, I dare say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you don't! I've {{accepted}} you. Do {{you think}} I'm {{going to lose}} the one real playmate I've ever had? It was so lonely on the Boltwoods' brown stoop till Milt came along and whistled impertinently and made the solemn little girl in frills play marbles and---- Watch out for that turn! Heavens, how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after you! Is there a class in cooking at your university? No--do--not--kiss--me--on--a--turn!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{to in the}} way of a career?" [...] If {{that was}} her meaning he could show after an instant that he didn't fear it. [...] "Well, your father, dear {{delightful}} man, has been so good as to give me to understand that he backs me for a decent deserving creature; and I've noticed, as you doubtless yourself have, that when Lord Theign backs a fellow----!" ...|$|E
60|$|Did {{you ever}} go house-hunting 3,000 miles away? It costs three months of writing and {{telegraphing}} {{to pull off a}} success. We finished 3 or 4 days ago, and took the Villa Papiniano (dam the name, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it a minutes after writing it, and then am always in doubt) for a year by cable. Three miles outside of Florence, under Fiesole--a darling location, and apparently a choice house, near Fiske.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} Marble's {{expedient}} was thus explained, and I confess I was much relieved by {{a knowledge of}} the truth. Apart from the general relief that accompanied the consciousness of not having taken human life, should we again fall into English hands, a thing by no means improbable, in the situation in which we were placed, this circumstance might be of the last importance to us. In the mean time, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the boat and the ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brendon," [...] she said, [...] "if I {{could ask}} for advice, or borrow money from any one, I would from you--there! But I cannot. I never could. I suppose <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a man. You see, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after myself so long that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{developed}} a terrible bump of independence." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for {{a friend}} to go to Silu.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will soon}} be at home with them," [...] said Harry reassuringly. [...] "Jenny and Kate are just about your ages, and I expect they will have grown so I shall hardly know them. It is nearly three years now since I left them, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at you to assure myself that Jenny will have grown almost into a young woman. Now I shall {{go out for a}} bit, and leave you to chat together.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{father looked}} at her over his glasses and spoke with grave deliberation; [...] "If there is {{anything}} {{you want to say to}} me," [...] he said, [...] "you must say it in the study. I am going to smoke a little here, and then I shall go to the study. I don't see what you can have to say. I should have thought my note cleared up everything. There are some papers <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> through to-night--important papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My {{foundation}} laid {{on earth}} for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered {{in the band}} who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to, and to live for." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{her in the}} eyes, since {{nothing else}} would do her; and, as I did so, all the might of manhood in me rose up in hot revolt against the lie <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> told her. That unfaltering, impelling gaze of hers drew the truth from my lips in spite of myself.|$|R
5000|$|Walker says,"it was an {{incredibly}} difficult novel <b>to</b> write, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at, and name, and speak up about violence among {{black people in}} the black community {{at the same time that}} black people (and some whites)--including me and my family were enduring massive psychological and physical violence from white supremacists in the southern states, particularly Mississippi." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was found}} in her tomb--only think!" [...] says C., turning gravely <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> another way, while the priest {{proceeded}} to introduce, by name, four remarkably yellow skulls, with tastefully trimmed red caps on, as those of St. Ursula and sundry of her most intimate friends. S. looked gloriously indignant, and C. increasingly solemn.|$|R
