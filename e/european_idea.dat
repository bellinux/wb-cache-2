2500|$|... – In a {{telegram}} addressed to Karl von Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, Pope Benedict XVI offered his condolences to the House of Habsburg. Benedict praised Otto von Habsburg as [...] "a great European" [...] {{who had worked}} tirelessly for peace, the coexistence of peoples and a just order in Europe. [...] "In the hour of grief over this tragic loss, I associate myself with you and the entire imperial family in prayer for the deceased. In a long and fulfilling life, Archduke Otto was {{a witness to the}} eventful history of Europe," [...] the Pope wrote. Cardinal Renato Martino remembered Otto as one of the twentieth century's [...] "greatest defenders" [...] of the Catholic faith and human dignity, stating that his father, [...] "Blessed Karl of Austria, instilled in him from an early age that the office of a ruler is one of holy service and selfless sacrifice {{for the good of the}} peoples entrusted to him. It was a philosophy that would influence him all his life." [...] Cardinal Christoph Schönborn said that [...] "Otto von Habsburg was without doubt one of the really great Europeans," [...] and that he should be regarded as one of the [...] "architects of the <b>European</b> <b>idea</b> and of European integration" [...] together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Schörnborn regretted that it had taken so much time for Austria to show [...] "the reasonable gratitude towards the House of Habsburg, which Austria owes so incredibly much" [...] and whose [...] "political and cultural heritage we consume today." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then, {{provided}} with some sanctified Arabic book, I {{prepare for the}} reception of visitors. They come in by dozens,--no man having apparently any business to occupy him,--doff their slippers at the door, enter wrapped up in their Tobes or togas [5], and deposit their spears, point- upwards, in the corner; those who have swords--the mark of respectability in Eastern Africa--place them at their feet. They shake the full hand (I was reproved for offering the fingers only); and when politely disposed, the inferior wraps his fist in the hem of his garment. They have nothing corresponding with the <b>European</b> <b>idea</b> of manners: they degrade all ceremony by the epithet Shughl el banat, or [...] "girls' work," [...] and pique themselves upon downrightness of manner,--a favourite mask, by the by, for savage cunning to assume. But they are equally free from affectation, shyness, and vulgarity; and, after all, no manners are preferable to bad manners.|$|E
6000|$|... (2) The fine {{is based}} on the old <b>European</b> <b>idea</b> that {{everybody}} possesses private property in some reasonable degree; but not only is this not true to-day, but it is not being made any truer, even by those who honestly believe that they are mending matters. The great employers will often do something towards improving what they call the [...] "conditions" [...] of their workers; but a worker might have his conditions as carefully arranged as a racehorse has, and still have no more personal property than a racehorse. If you take an average poor seamstress or factory girl, you will find that the power of chastising her through her property has very considerable limits; it is almost as hard for the employer of labour to tax her for punishment as it is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tax her for revenue. The next most obvious thing to think of, of course, would be imprisonment, and that might be effective enough under simpler conditions. An old-fashioned shopkeeper might have locked up his apprentice in his coal-cellar; but his coal-cellar would be a real, pitch dark coal-cellar, {{and the rest of his}} house would be a real human house. Everybody (especially the apprentice) would see a most perceptible difference between the two. But, as I pointed out in the article before this, the whole tendency of the capitalist legislation and experiment is to make imprisonment much more general and automatic, while making it, or professing to make it, more humane. In other words, the hygienic prison and the servile factory will become so uncommonly like each other that the poor man will hardly know or care whether he is at the moment expiating an offence or merely swelling a dividend. In both places there will be the same sort of shiny tiles. In neither place will there be any cell so unwholesome as a coal-cellar or so wholesome as a home. The weapon of the prison, therefore, like the weapon of the fine, will be found to have considerable limitations to its effectiveness when employed against the wretched reduced citizen of our day. Whether it be property or liberty you cannot take from him what he has not got. You cannot imprison a slave, because you cannot enslave a slave.|$|E
