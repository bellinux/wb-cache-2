50|$|The series (26 episodes) was {{screened}} on Fernsehen der DDR 1 (series {{one from}} May until August 1980 and series two from March until June 1981) with repeats of both series in 1983. French channel Antenne 2 screened all 26 episodes {{in the youth}} programme Recre A2 under the title Dick le Rebelle in a late afternoon slot between 11 December 1981 and 11 June 1982 and then repeating series one from 15 June 1983 to 21 September 1983 and series two between 18 September 1985 and 11 December 1985. The Austrian channel ORF1 screened the series in 1982 and 1983, the West German channel RTL Plus screened the series in 1985 and between 1987 and 1988. In May 1987, the new French channel Canal+ screened 'new episodes' the five-part version of Dick Turpin's Greatest Adventure on their <b>encrypted</b> <b>service.</b> Germany's WEST 3 screened the series between 1990 and 1991 and Tele 5 in 1992. The last German repeats were by ARD in October 1993 and DFI western movies in 1998. The series has been repeated back on UK Channel Plus in 2012, radio broadcasts of the episodes The Fox and Sentenced to Death were shown on digital channel Radio Gold, more episodes were promised but never materialized.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT⎯This letter {{proposes a}} {{conditional}} access system (CAS) suitable for use in terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB), based on an effective multiplexing method to provide <b>encrypted</b> T-DMB <b>services.</b> Specifically, the proposed multiplexing method for a CAS is designed to reduce the additional bit rate while assuring {{easy access to the}} designated <b>encrypted</b> <b>services.</b> Finally, the performance of the implemented CAS is confirmed through implementation and a broadcasting experiment under various service environments...|$|R

50|$|A conditional-access module can be {{inserted}} into a CI slot mostly found on modern IDTVs to enable decryption of <b>encrypted</b> <b>services.</b> Whilst Top Up TV offers a branded CAM only ESPN can be received. This {{is due to}} BSkyB having concerns with the security of these modules meaning Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 are not available.|$|R
40|$|WiFi {{radio access}} {{technology}} is being adopted {{as a part}} of the current small cell solutions of mobile networks. Any WiFi network with Internet connectivity can be used by the mobile device to access packet-based LTE services like voice calling and instant messaging. This service traffic is strictly confidential and needs to be protected with encryption when an untrusted access, i. e., a public hotspot access, is used. This new scenario requires a new network element that terminates the <b>encrypted</b> <b>service</b> connection. For Nokia Networks this element is called the Border Gateway. At the same time the telecommunications industry is moving towards cloud computing so network elements are being virtualized to operate on virtual machines running in the cloud instead of the current embedded systems. This thesis begins by discussing the current industry landscape and how both the WiFi small cells and the cloud-based network infrastructure are partly answering the problem of rapidly growing mobile data consumption. The focus of the thesis is studying the capabilities of the Border Gateway on the context of non-real-time service traffic encryption, with an emphasis on the virtualized platform. Also a general network security related validation is performed, as this element exists for providing security features. The virtualized Border Gateway proved to be ten times more capable than the original embedded system, because the current x 86 -based processors used in the cloud offer significantly more performance than the digital signal processors in the embedded system. The fact that the Unix operating system and related software in the cloud are mostly open source, proved that security related testing only needed to be performed on the embedded platform, as there the platform software is closed-source and not already verified by the masses...|$|E
40|$|WhatsApp {{messenger}} {{is arguably}} the most popular mobile app available on all smart-phones. Over one billion people worldwide for free messaging, calling, and media sharing use it. In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default end-to-end <b>encrypted</b> <b>service.</b> This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls, videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp. In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on its privacy preservation mechanisms. We report that the Signal Protocol, which forms the basis of WhatsApp end-to-end encryption, does offer protection against forward secrecy, and MITM to a large extent. Finally, we argue that simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy. The metadata can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their patterns, and personal information. This paper elaborates on the security architecture of WhatsApp and performs an analysis on the various protocols used. This enlightens us on the status quo of the app security and what further measures can be used to fill existing gaps without compromising the usability. We start by describing the following (i) important concepts that need to be understood to properly understand security, (ii) the security architecture, (iii) security evaluation, (iv) followed by a summary of our work. Some of the important concepts that we cover in this paper before evaluating the architecture are - end-to-end encryption (E 2 EE), signal protocol, and curve 25519. The description of the security architecture covers key management, end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp, Authentication Mechanism, Message Exchange, and finally the security evaluation. We then cover importance of metadata and role it plays in conserving privacy with respect to whatsapp. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

30|$|For {{cellular}} operators, {{estimating the}} end-user experience from network measurements is a challenging task. For video-streaming service, several analytical {{models have been}} proposed to estimate user opinion from buffering metrics. However, there remains the problem of estimating these buffering metrics from the limited set of measurements available on a per-connection basis for <b>encrypted</b> video <b>services.</b> In this paper, a system testbed is presented for automatically constructing a simple, albeit accurate, Quality-of-Experience (QoE) model for <b>encrypted</b> video-streaming <b>services</b> in a wireless network. The testbed consists of a terminal agent, a network-level emulator, and Probe software, which are used to compare end-user and network-level measurements. For illustration purposes, the testbed is used to derive the formulas to compute video performance metrics from TCP/IP metrics for encrypted YouTube traffic in a Wi-Fi network. The resulting formulas, {{which would be the}} core of a video-streaming QoE model, are also applicable to cellular networks, as the test campaign fully covers typical mobile network conditions and the formulas are partly validated in a real LTE network.|$|R
