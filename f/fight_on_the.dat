5|$|In {{only his}} second {{fight for the}} UFC, Jon Jones took on The Ultimate Fighter 1 runner-up Stephan Bonnar at light heavyweight in the third <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main card. Jones was able to execute {{multiple}} throws and takedowns {{during the first two}} rounds, at one point suplexing Bonnar. Jones also had the most success striking and was able to knock down his opponent with a spinning elbow-strike. Bonnar rallied with strikes against the tiring Jones in the third round, but the bout went the distance with the judges scoring it 29–28 once and 30–27 twice all in favor of Jones.|$|E

The bout saw Fitch continually taking down Gono and landing with ground-and-pound punches on the downed opponent.

All three judges scored the bout in favor of Fitch, two scoring it 30–27 with one judge seeing it 30–26 giving Fitch the unanimous decision victory.|$|E

The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front lines, eventually preventing the North Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the North Koreans from the area.|$|E

Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when {{they learn that}} they both have advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E

5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front lines, and some resolved {{that they might have}} to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, {{the regiment}} was reconstituted on 22 February 1916 when all three squadrons assembled at Heliopolis. Under a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Royston– {{a veteran of}} the Boer War who had replaced Abbott after the latter had been sent to England– the regiment began to re-form. At the time of re-forming, it had been intended that the 12th would be assigned to the 5th Division as its divisional light horse regiment; however, it was decided {{to reduce the size of}} divisional light horse components to a squadron, and the 12th were removed from the 5th Division's order of battle. Although other units, such as part of the 4th and all of the 13th Light Horse Regiment, were sent to Europe to <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front, the 12th, along with the bulk of the Australian light horse units, were to remain in the Middle East, where they would take part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Initially, the regiment was not brigaded and served as a detached unit.|$|E

5|$|Natalya {{programs}} {{the satellite}} to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko {{to save the}} satellite, Boris unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (received earlier from Q), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the cradle explodes, and falls, crushing and killing Trevelyan and destroying the base. Amazingly, Boris survives, but is frozen solid in a cascade of liquid nitrogen. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade {{and a team of}} Marines.|$|E
5|$|The G3s {{incorporated}} several novel {{features for}} dreadnought-era capital ships, {{or at least}} for British designs of this type. Most immediately noticeable was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and engineering spaces, giving the ships a tanker-like appearance. Since the G3s were to use existing dockyard facilities, this layout allowed designers to keep {{the length of the}} ships, as well as the weight of armour, to a minimum. The resulting loss of heavy fire astern was considered justifiable since the ships were intended to <b>fight</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broadside. A related feature of the G3 and N3 designs was their tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
