The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner.

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradient,</b> which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

30|$|Before {{reconstructing the}} {{regional}} denudation histories from the cooling ages, possible local thermal effects on ages due to volcanism should be discussed. In the NE Japan Arc, Quaternary volcanoes are distributed along the OBR {{and parts of}} the Dewa Hills (e.g., Committee for Catalog of Quaternary Volcanoes in Japan 1999; Tamura et al. 2002). Therefore, the geothermal structure of the NE Japan Arc is complex and quite different from region to region (Fig.  1 a). <b>Geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> on the fore-arc side commonly range ~ 20 to 40  °C/km (Tanaka et al. 2004). However, slightly higher <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> of ~ 30 to 60  °C/km are observed in the OBR and on the back-arc side (Tanaka et al. 2004). Anomalous <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> > 100  °C/km were also reported at some spots along the OBR, for instance, around the Quaternary volcanoes (Tanaka et al. 2004).|$|R

25|$|The {{detachment}} {{along the}} weak layers was likely {{aided by the}} presence of high-pressure water in the sediment pore spaces. This possibility has interesting astrobiological implications. If water-saturated zones still exist in sediments under the volcano, they would likely have been kept warm by a high <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradient</b> and residual heat from the volcano's magma chamber. Potential springs or seeps around the volcano would offer exciting possibilities for detecting microbial life.|$|E
25|$|Water issuing from a {{hot spring}} is heated geothermally, that is, with heat {{produced}} from the Earth's mantle. In general, {{the temperature of}} rocks within the earth increases with depth. The rate of temperature increase with depth {{is known as the}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> If water percolates deeply enough into the crust, it will be heated as it comes into contact with hot rocks. The water from hot springs in non-volcanic areas is heated in this manner.|$|E
40|$|Although plate {{tectonics}} {{is the central}} geological process of the modern Earth, its form and existence during the Archaean era (4. 0 - 2. 5 Gyr ago) are disputed. The existence of subduction during this time is particularly controversial because characteristic subduction-related mineral assemblages, typically documenting apparent <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> of 15 °C km- 1 or less, {{have not yet been}} recorded from in situ Archaean rocks (the lowest recorded apparent <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> are greater than 25 °C km - 1). Despite this absence from the rock record, low Archaean <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> are suggested by eclogitic nodules in kimberlites and circumstantial evidence for subduction processes, including possible accretion-related structures, has been reported in Archaean terrains. The lack of spatially and temporally well-constrained high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism continues, however, to cast doubt on the relevance of subduction-driven tectonics during the first 1. 5 Gyr of the Earth's history. Here we report garnet-albite-bearing mineral assemblages that record pressures of 1. 2 - 1. 5 GPa at temperatures of 600 - 650 °C from supracrustal amphibolites from the mid-Archaean Barberton granitoid-greenstone terrain. These conditions point to apparent <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients</b> of 12 - 15 °C-similar to those found in recent subduction zones-that coincided with the main phase of terrane accretion in the structurally overlying Barberton greenstone belt. These high-pressure, low-temperature conditions represent metamorphic evidence for cold and strong lithosphere, as well as subduction-driven tectonic processes, during the evolution of the early Earth. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|Anastomosing shear zones {{exposed in}} the lower crust of the Kohistan palaeoisland arc in Pakistan have parageneses {{indicating}} increasing pressure during deformation. Therefore, they represent a rare example of strain localization during crustal thickening. We investigated the seismic properties of a sheared gabbro with constant bulk chemistry across one of these shear zones. The compressional wave velocity was measured at confining pressures of up to 0. 5 GPa and temperatures of up to 600 8 C. The density, the average Vp (compressional P-wave velocity) and the acoustic impedance at room temperature increase from the undeformed protolith through the strain gradient to the intensely sheared mylonite. The seismic anisotropy is largest for the strain gradient. The Vp dependence of the velocities on temperature is much higher in the mylonite than in the protolith. The acoustic impedance contrast between protolith and mylonite is high enough to generate seismic reflections at low temperatures, but not at high temperatures. This suggests that the seismic reflectivity may also depend on the temperature. Consequently, ductile shear zones can be detected in reflection profiles of crusts with low <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients,</b> and may be transparent in crusts with high <b>geothermal</b> <b>gradients...</b>|$|R
