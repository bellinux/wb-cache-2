6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} maybe nothing wrong there again," [...] said Flora. [...] "There! there's the front <b>door</b> <b>banging!</b> He is off! Ethel!--" [...] {{stepping}} to the door, and calling in her sister, {{who came from}} the street door, her hair blowing about with the wind. [...] "What did Norman want?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{sat down}} by the fire again while the two men {{finished}} their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, {{and the old man}} started nervously at the sound of a <b>door</b> <b>banging</b> upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled upon all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the night.|$|E
60|$|The gentlemanly burglar and the {{policeman}} lent their aid {{to pull the}} man into the train; the <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> and they were away.|$|R
6000|$|As she spoke, a <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> in the {{passageway}} without, and {{the ring of}} iron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank! ...|$|R
6000|$|Augustine's indignant {{face grew}} {{full of a}} new trouble as the <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> below, and he pressed his thin hands tightly together, saying, as if to himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave {{orders to}} call me at the {{slightest}} change," [...] said the Captain. He reached up to put the book away, and tucked his legs upon the couch. [...] "Shut the door so that it don't fly open, will you? I can't stand a <b>door</b> <b>banging.</b> They've {{put a lot of}} rubbishy locks into this ship, I must say." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{one sense}} {{it must be}} {{admitted}} that we can never prove the existence of things other than ourselves and our experiences. No logical absurdity results from {{the hypothesis that the}} world consists of myself and my thoughts and feelings and sensations, and that everything else is mere fancy. In dreams a very complicated world may seem to be present, and yet on waking we find it was a delusion; that is to say, we find that the sense-data in the dream do not appear to have corresponded with such physical objects as we should naturally infer from our sense-data. (It is true that, when the physical world is assumed, it is possible to find physical causes for the sense-data in dreams: a <b>door</b> <b>banging,</b> for instance, may cause us to dream of a naval engagement. But although, in this case, there is a physical cause for the sense-data, there is not a physical object corresponding to the sense-data {{in the way in which}} an actual naval battle would correspond.) There is no logical impossibility in the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we ourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action on us causes our sensations.|$|E
6000|$|... "A word, {{ladies and}} gentlemen," [...] said the doctor; [...] "literally a word, on nervous derangement first. What {{is the process}} of treatment, when, let us say, mental anxiety has broken you down, and you apply to your doctor? He sees you, hears you, and gives you two prescriptions. One is written on paper, and made up at the chemist's. The other is {{administered}} by word of mouth, at the propitious moment when the fee is ready; and consists in a general recommendation to you to keep your mind easy. That excellent advice given, your doctor leaves you to spare yourself all earthly annoyances by your own unaided efforts, until he calls again. Here my System steps in and helps you! When I see the necessity of keeping your mind easy, I take the bull by the horns and do it for you. I place you in a sphere of action in which the ten thousand trifles which must, and do, irritate nervous people at home are expressly considered and provided against. I throw up impregnable moral intrenchments between Worry and You. Find a <b>door</b> <b>banging</b> in this house, if you can! Catch a servant in this house rattling the tea-things when he takes away the tray! Discover barking dogs, crowing cocks, hammering workmen, screeching children here--and I engage to close My Sanitarium to-morrow! Are these nuisances laughing matters to nervous people? Ask them! Can they escape these nuisances at home? Ask them! Will ten minutes' irritation from a barking dog or a screeching child undo every atom of good done to a nervous sufferer by a month's medical treatment? There isn't a competent doctor in England who will venture to deny it! On those plain grounds my System is based. I assert the medical treatment of nervous suffering to be entirely subsidiary to the moral treatment of it. That moral treatment of it you find here. That moral treatment, sedulously pursued throughout the day, follows the sufferer into his room at night; and soothes, helps and cures him, without his own knowledge--you shall see how." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What I {{am afraid}} of,' said the Prince, 'is a <b>banging</b> <b>door,</b> by day or night. I am not, otherwise, of a nervous constitution, but if I hear a <b>door</b> <b>bang,</b> I must go and hunt for it, {{and stop the}} noise, either by {{shutting}} the door, or leaving it wide open. I am a sound sleeper, but, if a <b>door</b> <b>bangs,</b> it wakens me at once. I try not to notice it. I hope it will leave off. Then it does leave off--that is the artfulness of it--and, just as you are falling asleep, knock it goes! A double knock, sometimes. Then I simply must get up, and hunt for that door, upstairs or downstairs--' ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{a little}} further waiting for him, Mrs. Glendinning heard Pierre's voice--"Yes, before eight o'clock at least, Lucy--no fear;" [...] and then the hall <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> and Pierre {{returned}} to her.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was just}} a {{perceptible}} pause before he said a low [...] "good-bye." [...] and passed out of the room. Almost immediately after, she heard the heavy hall <b>door</b> <b>bang</b> behind him.|$|R
5000|$|The Empress goes to see Eleanora. She {{sees her}} right arm has been burned and asks what happened. Eleanora tells her that it is {{scarring}} from a lightning strike. The Empress is amazed. Eleonora's cellmate screams that the woman is a witch and she runs to the cell <b>door</b> <b>banging</b> hard on it to be let out. The Empress leaves the cell still wondering how the woman survived.|$|E
5000|$|The {{train crew}} was {{originally}} accused of {{running from the}} scene by Jean-Hugues Anglade, a French actor traveling with his partner {{and children in the}} No. 11 car (the last car before the rear engine). He alleged that the train crew locked themselves in the engine car and did not {{come to the aid of}} passengers. Anglade told Paris Match that they heard gunshots and screaming in the next car, after which several crew members rushed past them to the engine car, opened it with a special key and locked themselves inside. Anglade, said he saw the gunman through the door between the cars and that the dozen passengers in his car were pressed against the engine car <b>door,</b> <b>banging</b> on it and begging the crew to open it: ...|$|E
50|$|The next day, Reilly {{has been}} arrested and Tommy and Tuppence meet with the accused man's solicitor, Mr Marvell. Reilly insists that the woman was dead when he entered her room but, as {{there was no one}} else in the house at the time, that would mean either Ellen or Mrs Honeycott killed her. Tommy {{suddenly}} realises no one inside the house saw Gilda enter - they only heard her. Before that the two women already in the house were in the kitchen, where they couldn't see or hear anyone entering with a key. Just because they heard the <b>door</b> <b>banging,</b> it doesn't prove anything. It could just as easily have been someone leaving the house â€” like the policeman who loomed up out of the fog by the gate and who carries a truncheon, which would serve as the blunt instrument needed to carry out the deed, especially if the policeman happened to be Gilda's husband of long-ago.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Drummond banner! Ye {{shall see}} how Glenuskie mocks at this same fine fancy of yours'; {{and he ran}} downstairs at no kingly pace, letting the heavy nail-studded <b>door</b> <b>bang</b> after him.|$|R
50|$|After killing Chelbi, Marco {{had heard}} the back <b>door</b> <b>bang,</b> and came back out. That's when Marco saw that Courtney Sharon was gone. Marco took more things out of the house, and then fled.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> faintly, and in {{the great}} room rose the busy silence of those minutes which precede repasts. Suddenly the four men by the breakfast fable stood back. Lord Valleys had come in.|$|R
60|$|That was {{all that}} Bill heard, for he had {{stumbled}} across the hall and was in his room, {{sitting on the bed}} and staring into the darkness with burning eyes. The <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> behind him.|$|R
60|$|The {{door leading}} from library to hall was opened. A footman helped the {{stranger}} on with coat and hat. Then the street <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> to again, {{and once more}} the house lapsed into silence and gloom.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{carried her}} eyes wistfully to the train, where, amid cries of [...] "En voiture, en voiture!" [...] heads were at windows and <b>doors</b> <b>banging</b> loud. The porter was pressing. [...] "Ah vous n'avez plus le temps!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was while}} in this mood that the screen <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> loudly behind {{the heels of}} Tudor, who strode {{into the room and}} paused before him. Sheldon was unprepared, though it was very {{apparent}} that the other was furious.|$|R
60|$|The {{sentence}} remained unfinished. A sudden {{movement of}} the earl's hand, and the great <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> in his face. There came {{the sound of a}} bolt shooting into its socket. A key turned in the lock. He was trapped.|$|R
60|$|In {{the act of}} {{stepping}} forth I turned for a final handshake with Flora, and my foot caught in something and dragged it out upon the road. I stooped to pick it up, and heard the <b>door</b> <b>bang</b> by my ear.|$|R
6000|$|CARMODY (exasperated). Sure who wouldn't {{get drunk}} {{with all the}} sorrows of the world piled on him? (He stamps out. A moment later the outside <b>door</b> <b>bangs</b> behind him. Eileen sighs. Nicholls walks {{up and down with}} his eyes on the floor.) ...|$|R
60|$|A <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> quick {{footsteps}} sounded on the stairs, and Isaac {{came rushing}} into the room. Betty, deathly pale, {{stood with her}} hands pressed to her bosom, and looked at Isaac with a question in her eyes that her tongue could not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Massa Tom, dey did not shut de door, because, {{a little}} while after, Sam, he wake up wid little start; he hear de <b>door</b> <b>bang,</b> and 'spose Massa Peter come back. Sam go off to sleep again till you ring bell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, go and choke yourself!" [...] said Miss Hobson, crisply. And, {{swinging}} round like a blue panther, she strode off. A <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> and {{the sound}} of it seemed to restore Mr. Cracknell's power of movement. He, too, shot up stage and disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} the strange orchid still lay there, black now and putrescent. The <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> {{intermittently}} in the morning breeze, and all the array of Wedderburn's orchids was shrivelled and prostrate. But Wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his strange adventure.|$|R
60|$|He took up an easy {{attitude}} {{against the}} window, {{and watched the}} empress of the emotional drama explore. Presently she desisted, baffled. For an instant she paused, as though about to speak, then swept from the room. A moment later a <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> across the passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{refuse to}} explain," [...] she returned, {{and as she}} said it the front <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> to. [...] "There!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "He is gone!" [...] She flashed such a look of fiery indignation at her father that he lost his {{self-control}} for a moment.|$|R
60|$|After a long long while, {{the game}} stopped, and the <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> I slept because I was dead tired. Otherwise I should have {{preferred}} to have kept awake. Not for everything in Asia would I have dropped the door-bar and peered into {{the dark of the}} next room.|$|R
60|$|And then Fate {{came to his}} assistance. Somewhere in {{the house}} a <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> like a cannon-shot. Perspiration broke upon the secretary's brow. He sank limply back in his chair, giving himself up for lost. Anselme started and bit the knuckle of his {{forefinger}} in a manner suggesting an inarticulate imprecation.|$|R
6000|$|... "The lad is a heathen," [...] said Hunsden, {{and taking}} his hat from a sideboard, {{he left the}} room, {{laughing}} to himself. I had half an inclination to follow him: I really intended to leave X---- the next morning, and should certainly not have another opportunity of bidding him good-bye. The front <b>door</b> <b>banged</b> to.|$|R
50|$|Ethan {{starts to}} {{initiate}} activities aimed at unsettling Grainey {{to make him}} believe the house is haunted, including making the kitchen <b>door</b> <b>bang</b> loudly {{in the middle of}} the night, disabling the heating system (which causes the bedroom window to shatter because of the freezing temperature), and activating the stereo {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} to wait, I am to do the work," [...] said John {{beginning}} his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself {{with an air of}} relief as the front <b>door</b> <b>banged,</b> [...] "Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have some sensible conversation." ...|$|R
