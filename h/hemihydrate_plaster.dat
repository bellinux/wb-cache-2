40|$|TO {{develop a}} system which will dry moist {{synthetic}} gypsum with subsequent calcination to hemihydrate suitable for the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. Pilot plant trials were successful using a Torbed TM thermal processor to dry and calcine wet synthetic gypsum into a usable <b>hemihydrate</b> (<b>plaster</b> of Paris). The product would be suitable for the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. Fuel consumption was much higher than expected indicating that a system of this nature would incur a much higher fuel cost than current systems with separate dryers and calciners. Efforts to significantly reduce this high fuel consumption were not successful. ...|$|E
