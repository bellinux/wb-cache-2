By September 1987, Dolan's side topped Division Two for the first time in 54years. They finished fourth after a final day defeat to Ipswich Town and missed out on promotion after they lost to Middlesbrough in the play-offs. Leading players Stuart McCall and John Hendrie, who had both stayed for another season in a bid to take City into Division One, both left, and within two seasons City again dropped into Division Three. In January 1988 Stafford Heginbotham resigned as the Club's Chairman due to ill health.|$|E

50|$|But {{with low}} deer populations, a new forest quickly grew. This forest was {{different}} from the previous one because conditions were now different. Shade-tolerant, long-lived trees like hemlock and beech gave way to sun-loving, shorter-lived species like black cherry, which readily germinated on the bare sunny <b>ground.</b> <b>Cherry,</b> red maple, black birch, and sugar maple became common species in the understory.|$|E

Crops grown here include numerous local maize varieties; Andean roots and tubers such as oca, mashua, melloco, and arracacha; pseudo-cereals such as quinoa and amaranth; tropical fruits such as tree tomatoes, <b>ground</b> <b>cherries,</b> passion fruits, highland papayas and [...] ...|$|R
50|$|While {{primarily}} an insectivore, the striped skunk is adaptable enough to incorporate other animals and even vegetable matter into its diet. The most frequently consumed insects include grasshoppers, beetles, crickets, and caterpillars. In {{the winter and}} spring months, the striped skunk will supplement its diet with vertebrates such as white-footed mice, voles, eggs and the chicks of ground nesting birds. Striped skunks inhabiting California's coastal areas will feed on crabs and beached fish. While not adapted for chasing fleet-footed prey, at least one specimen was observed pursuing gray cottontails into their burrows. When in season, the skunk will also consume vegetable matter, such as apples, blueberries, black <b>cherries,</b> <b>ground</b> <b>cherries,</b> corn and nightshade.|$|R

These weed species include Solanum nigrum (nightshade), S. aculeatissimum (soda apple), Chenopodium album (pigweed), Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Linaria canadensis (blue toadflax), and Physalis spp. (<b>ground</b> <b>cherry).</b> Thus, recommendations for the control of this virus include the control of weeds in and around susceptible solanaceous crops.|$|E

[...] The Sheldon family opened a market at their farm in 1999 and introduced green beans, peas, zucchini and summer squashes, varietal eggplant, pumpkins, winter squash, Brussels sprouts, kale, tomatillos, and edible flowers to their production mix.

50|$|The mice eat small {{insects and}} coastal plant such as beach grasses and sea oats. They gather seeds which have {{separated}} from the plant and blown to the ground. Every night, they leave their burrows to gather the sea oat seeds which have blown to the ground, then return them to their burrows for storage. Due to the highly variable climate of coastal habitats, though, several seasonal plants can offer additional food sources throughout the year, such as the beach pea (Galactia spp.), coastal <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> (Physalis angustifolia), dixie sandmat (Euphorbia bombensis), tall jointweed (Polygonella gracilis), seaside pennywort (Hydrocotyle bonariensis), seacoast marshelder (Iva imbricata), and evening primrose (Oenothera humifusa).|$|E
50|$|Not all Physalis species bear edible fruit. Select {{species are}} {{cultivated}} for their edible fruit, however; the typical Physalis fruit {{is similar to}} a firm tomato in texture, and like strawberries or pineapple in flavor, with a mild acidity. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Physalis fruit are rich in cryptoxanthin.The fruit can be used like the tomato. Once extracted from its husk, it can be eaten raw and used in salads. Some varieties are added to desserts, used as flavoring, made into fruit preserves, or dried and used like raisins. They contain pectin and can be used in pie filling. <b>Ground</b> <b>cherries</b> are called Poha in native Hawaiian, and poha jam and preserves are traditional desserts made from Physalis plants native to the Hawaiian Islands.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Cherry, and Margo St. James, filed {{a lawsuit}} against Ed Koch, then mayor of New York City, seeking to {{overturn}} New York's laws banning prostitution on the <b>grounds</b> that <b>Cherry's</b> disability would make it impossible for him to find sexual companionship other than prostitutes, thereby violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Some of them include tomato, black nightshade, lambsquarters and <b>ground</b> <b>cherry.</b> The potato mop top virus' primary hosts are {{plants in the}} Solanaceae and Chenopodiaceae. Potatoes that are infected by PMTV generally show hollow necrotic spots on the inside. This virus shows different symptoms in Europe; for example, the infected plants usually show dark brown necrotic arcs that discolor the tuber's flesh (these symptoms {{are very similar to}} those caused by alfalfa mosaic virus). Interestingly, plants showing no symptoms of PMTV tend to produce larger quantities of infected tubers if they are derived from plants that have shown foliar symptoms in the previous year.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>cherry</b> (Physalis divaricata L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} summer weeds in sugar beet crop in the west of Iran. In order to estimate the damage rate of this weed, field studies were conducted to quantify the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> density on sugar beet yield and to determine relationships among different weed densities (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 plants m- 2) and sugar beet yield in 2008. The experiment design was randomized complete blocks with three replications. In addition, the neighborhood effect of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> was assessed in a completely randomized design. Neighborhood effect was surveyed from zero to 125 cm apart from each beet plant to <b>ground</b> <b>cherry.</b> Density of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> was estimated as the systematic method in 30 sugar beet fields that were chosen randomly. Phonology of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> was recorded based on the GDD (Growth Degree Day) and date. Results showed that two weed plants m 2 of this weed resulted in 34 % damage to sugar beet. <b>Ground</b> <b>cherry</b> significantly reduced yield of sugar beet when sown 50 cm apart from crop plant. Crop damage of sugar beet was 41 % when <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> seeds were sown at zero cm apart from each sugar beet plant.

40|$|To {{understand}} germination and emergence {{characteristics of}} black henbane, <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> and curly dock a laboratory experiment, based on randomized complete block design with four replications, {{was carried out}} at the Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2012.

The effect of pH adjusted to 5 - 9 by using acid buffer solution. Seeds were planted at different depth (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm) to study their effects on seedling emergence. Results showed that black henbane exhibited highest germination percentage at 25 / 15 diurnal tempratures, with 86. 50 and 60. 50 respectivly for daylight and complete darkness. Germination of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> was highest (93 %) at 10 / 20 diurnal temprature and 41 % in complete darkness. Highest germination percentage for curly dock at diurnal temperatures of 20 / 10, 25 / 15 and 30 / 20 with light / dark regime of constant darkness was abserved. The seeds at diurnal temprature of 35 / 25 in both light regimes did not germinate. Increasing salinity reduced germination. Increasing the osmotic potential, also reduced germination significantly. Highest germination percentage of black henbane (97 %) was observed at pH 7, and lowest germination (17 %) at pH 9. Increasing planting depth reduced seedling emergence significantly. Germination percentages of <b>ground</b> <b>cherry</b> and curly dock at pH 6 and 7 were highest (97 % and 96 % respectively) and lowest 26 and 25 % respectively at pH 9...|$|E
