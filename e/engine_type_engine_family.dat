40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been recently received {{on the impact of}} aircraft-produced aerosols upon the global climate. Sampling particles directly from jet engines has been performed by different research groups in the U. S. and Europe. However, a large variation has been observed among published data on the conversion efficiency and emission indexes of jet engines. The variation results surely from the differences in test <b>engine</b> <b>types,</b> <b>engine</b> operation conditions, and environmental conditions. The other factor that could result in the observed variation is the performance of sampling probes used. Unfortunately, it is often neglected in the jet engine community. Particle losses during the sampling, transport, and dilution processes are often not discussed/considered in literatures. To address this issue, we evaluated the performance of one sampling probe by challenging it with monodisperse particles. A significant performance difference was observed on the sampling probe evaluated under different temperature conditions. Thermophoretic effect, nonisokinetic sampling and turbulence loss contribute to the loss of particles in sampling probes. The results of this study show that particle loss can be dramatic if the sampling probe is not well designed. Further, the result allows ones to recover the actual size distributions emitted from jet engines...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors compare and {{contrast}} open and closed-cycle heat engines. First of all, by way of example and to aid discussion, the performance of proprietary externally heated closed-cycle Stirling engines is {{compared with that of}} internally heated open Otto cycle <b>engines.</b> Both <b>types</b> of <b>engine</b> have disadvantages and merits and this suggested that in order to accommodate the best of both <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> an externally-heated open-cycle <b>engine</b> might offer a more satisfactory solution for small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) systems. To investigate this possibility further the paper goes on to compare the performance of externally-heated and recuperated Joule hot-air cycle engines with that of an externally-heated closed Stirling cycle engines. The results show that an externally heated recuperated open Joule cycle engine can exceed that of a closed cycle Stirling engine operating between the same heat source and sink temperatures when a variable temperature heat source is used...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work is to propose a tradespace {{exploration}} framework for the design and system analysis of Stirling engines. The framework {{can be used to}} execute trade studies for different objectives. The framework obtains Pareto frontiers of optimal designs by evaluating performance (power, efficiency) and cost metrics for 750 Stirling engine design alternatives. The proposed system design framework integrates four domain models. An engine cycle thermodynamic model is to calculate engine cycle and performance parameters. A heat exchanger model is to estimate areas of heat exchangers. An economic model to predict the capital cost of the engine system. And a tradespace model based on five design parameters identified as drivers of the design: Stirling <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> (alpha, beta, or gamma), engine bore, stroke, hot space temperature, and cold space temperature. The results of the model shed insights on the design of Stirling engines and develop guidelines to identify the most suitable combinations of engine architectures and design parameters to address specific applications. The paper shows how the proposed framework {{can be applied to the}} design of Stirling engines for two different applications, namely waste heat recovery and combined heat and power generation for residential real estate units. Considering the identified customer needs for these two applications, the results of the study indicate that alpha-type Stirling engines are more appropriate for industrial waste heat recovery, e. g. heat treating furnaces and cement kilns, having a power output 50 % higher for a given efficiency then other <b>engine</b> <b>types.</b> Beta-type <b>engines</b> result more beneficial for residential combined heat and power generation.
