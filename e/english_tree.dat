2500|$|The modern English word druid {{derives from}} the Latin druides (pronounced [...] ), which was {{considered}} by ancient Roman writers {{to come from the}} native Celtic Gaulish word for these figures. Other Roman texts also employ the form druidae, while the same term was used by Greek ethnographers as [...] (druidēs). Although no extant Romano-Celtic inscription is known to contain the form, the word is cognate with the later insular Celtic words, Old Irish druí ‘druid, sorcerer’, Old Cornish druw, Middle Welsh dryw ‘seer; wren’. Based on all available forms, the hypothetical proto-Celtic word may then be reconstructed as *dru-wid-s (pl. *druwides) meaning [...] "oak-knower". The two elements go back to the Proto-Indo-European roots *deru-'deru-, a cognate to <b>English</b> <b>tree,</b> is the word for [...] "oak", though the root has a wider array of meanings related to [...] "to be firm, solid, steadfast" [...] (whence e.g. English true). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition, 2000 [...] and *weid- [...] "to see". The sense of [...] "oak-knower" [...] or [...] "oak-seer" [...] is supported by Pliny the Elder, who in his Natural History considered the word to contain the Greek noun drýs (δρύς), [...] "oak-tree" [...] and the Greek suffix -idēs (-ιδης). Both Old Irish druí and Middle Welsh dryw could also refer to the wren, possibly connected with an association of that bird with augury in Irish and Welsh tradition (see also Wren Day).|$|E
60|$|From {{the state}} rooms we {{were taken to}} the top of the Hound Tower, where we gained a {{magnificent}} view of the Park of Windsor, with its regal avenue, miles in length, of ancient oaks; its sweeps of greensward; clumps of trees; its old Herne oak, of classic memory; in short, all that constitutes the idea of a perfect English landscape. The <b>English</b> <b>tree</b> is shorter and stouter than ours; its foliage dense and deep, lying with a full, rounding outline against the sky. Every thing here conveys the idea of concentrated vitality, but without that rank luxuriance seen in our American growth. Having unfortunately exhausted the English language on the subject of grass, I will not repeat any ecstasies upon that topic.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} truck {{stopped at a}} manager's house with a Palmiste, {124} or cabbage-palm, {{on each side of}} the garden gate, a pair of columns which any prince would have longed for as {{ornaments}} for his lawn. It is the fashion here, and a good fashion it is, to leave the Palmistes, a few at least, when the land is cleared; or to plant them near the house, merely on account of their wonderful beauty. [...] One Palmiste was pointed out to me, in a field near the road, which had been measured by its shadow at noon, and found to be one hundred and fifty-three feet in height. For more than a hundred feet the stem rose straight, smooth, and gray. Then three or four spathes of flowers, four or five feet long each, jutted out and upward like; while from below them, as usual, one dead leaf, twenty feet long or more, dangled head downwards in the breeze. Above them rose, as always, the green portion of the stem for some twenty feet; and then the flat crown of feathers, as dark as yew, spread out against the blue sky, looking small enough up there, though forty feet at least in breadth. No wonder if the man who possessed such a glorious object dared not destroy it, though he spared it for a different reason from that for which the Negroes spare, whenever they can, the gigantic Ceibas, or silk cotton trees. These latter are useless as timber; and their roots are, of course, hurtful to the canes. But the Negro is shy of felling the Ceiba. It is a magic tree, haunted by spirits. There are 'too much jumbies in him,' the Negro says; and of those who dare to cut him down some one will die, or come to harm, within the year. In Jamaica, says my friend Mr. Gosse, 'they believe that if a person throws a stone at the trunk, he will be visited with sickness, or other misfortune. When they intend to cut one down, they first pour rum at the root as a propitiatory offering.' The Jamaica Negro, however, fells them for canoes, the wood being soft, and easily hollowed. But here, as in Demerara, the trees are left standing about in cane-pieces and pastures to decay into awful and fantastic shapes, with prickly spurs and board-walls of roots, high enough to make a house among them simply by roofing them in; and a flat crown of boughs, some seventy or eighty feet above the ground, each bough as big as an average <b>English</b> <b>tree,</b> from which dangles a whole world, of lianes, matapalos, orchids, wild pines with long air-roots or gray beards; and last, but not least, that strange and lovely parasite, the Rhipsalis cassytha, which you mistake first for a plume of green sea-weed, or a tress of Mermaid's hair which has got up there by mischance, and then for some delicate kind of pendent mistletoe; till you are told, to your astonishment, that it is an abnormal form of Cactus--a family which it resembles, save in its tiny flowers and fruit, no more than it resembles the Ceiba-tree on which it grows; and told, too, that, strangely enough, it has been discovered in Angola--the only species of the Cactus tribe in the Old World.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} Chinese-English Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) {{system based on}} {{dependency}} tree mappings. We use a state-of-the-art dependency parser to parse the English translation of the Penn Chinese Treebank to make it bilingual and then learn a tree-to-tree dependency mapping model. We also train a phrase-based translation model and collect a bilingual phrase lexicon to bootstrap a treelet translation model. For decoding, we use the same dependency parser on Chinese, using a log-linear framework to integrate the teamed translation model {{with a variety of}} dependency tree based probability models, and then find the best English dependency tree by dynamic programming. Finally the <b>English</b> <b>tree</b> is flattened to produce the translation.

40|$|In a {{continuous}} speech recognition system {{it is important}} to model the context dependent variations in the pronunciations of phones. In this work we have attempted to build decision trees for modeling phonetic context-dependency in Hindi. The approach followed is to modify a decision tree built to model context-dependency in American English. The reason the decision trees turn out to be different are that the English and Hindi phoneme sets are not identical. Then even for identical phonemes, the context-dependency is different for the two languages. Linguistic-Phonetic knowledge of Hindi is used to modify the English phone set. Since the Hindi phone set being used is derived from the English phone set, the adaptation of the <b>English</b> <b>tree</b> to Hindi follows naturally. Though here the adaptation is from English to Hindi, the method may be applicable for adapting between any two languages. The decision tree is built using either Hindi data or English data labeled with the correct Hindi contexts. This procedure is discussed and the limitations of both the methods are described. 1...|$|E
40|$|In 1959 IUFRO, the International Union of Forest Research, {{has adopted}} a {{standardized}} forest symbology that was published by Van Soest et al. (1959) with a new edition in 1965 by the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station. The symbology that is now proposed represents an update of the IUFRO symbology. The symbology {{is based on the}} English language being common the use of abbreviations of the English words (e. g. altura total da árvore is represented by h, from the <b>English</b> <b>tree</b> height). However, some symbols are from the German language (e. g [...] , basal area is represented by G, from the German Grundfläche), country responsible by the initial development of Silviculture, has a science, and where IUFRO was founded. When variables were not listed in the Van Soest work, a specific symbology was developed based, when possible, in the same principles that the IUFRO symbology. In this 2 nd version of “Symbols Used in Inventory and Modelling of Forest Resources” new symbols and English designations are included. In this work it was assumed that symbols should be easily recognized, simple and should not be in conflict with mathematical or other symbols commonly found in forest literature. Three types of symbols are presented: 1. tree variables, represented by small letters; 2. mean tree variables, variable symbol plus g letter, which represents mean tree basal area; e. g., dg, represents the quadratic mean diameter 3. stand variables, represented by capital letters when referred by unit area or small letters when represent the mean, extreme values or particular values of the tree in the stand. e. g.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a study}} on how Malaysian English is used in creative writing by a Malaysian writer. It studies the novel ‘Evening is a whole day’ by Preeta Samarasan. Focusing on the extraction and categorisation of Malaysian English lexical items and semantic terms used by a Malaysian writer, this research sets out to study {{the extent to which}} the writer uses lexical items and semantic terms from the non-native variety in her prose writing. Language purists have often accused non-native varieties as being the result of a failure of approximation. The deviations in these varieties are seen in a negative light and therefore the non-native varieties are considered inferior to Standard British English. If that is the case, the question arises as to why writers who are educated speakers of the language choose to use the local variety in their works. Analysis of data using Baskaran’s (2005) categorisation shows that the writer uses non-native lexical items in her writing. She also uses non-native semantic transfers based on the framework from Menon (2003). These findings show that although there are equivalents in the English language, the writer consciously chooses to use local words in her writing. This is clearly seen in the dialogues. The writer seems to have done this to depict the actual linguistic scenario in the country as the story studied here has a Malaysian setting. Thus, the study shows that there is a need for the use of Malaysian English in creative writing when the situation requires its usage. The use of local lexis items and semantic terms in the creative writing which gives our home grown variety of English a distinct and unique flavor should make it more acceptable and recognised as a legitimate sibling of Standard British English and not as an enigma to be hidden in the closet. It shows that the Malaysian variety is known around the globe as a branch in the Varieties of <b>English</b> <b>tree...</b>|$|E

60|$|Poets and moralists, {{judging from}} our <b>English</b> <b>trees</b> and fruits, {{have thought that}} small fruits always grew on lofty trees, so that their fall should be {{harmless}} to man, while the large ones trailed on the ground.
