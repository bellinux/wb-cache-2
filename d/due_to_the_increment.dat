Recently, automatic tools based on static and dynamic analysis have become widely used in industry to detect errors, such as null pointer dereferences, array indexing errors, assertion violations, etc. However, these techniques are typically applied late in the development cycle, and thus, the errors detected by such approaches are expensive to repair.
