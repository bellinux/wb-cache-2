2500|$|Subduction {{zones are}} places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a {{continental}} plate, collide. In this case, the oceanic plate subducts, or submerges, under the continental plate, forming a <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trench</b> just offshore. In a process called flux melting, water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, thus creating magma. This magma tends to be extremely [...] viscous because of its high silica content, so it often does not attain the surface but cools and solidifies at depth. [...] When it does reach the surface, however, a volcano is formed. Typical examples are Mount Etna and the volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire.|$|E

50|$|Both at {{the time}} of the {{disappearance}} and since, several people have suggested that the Waratah was caught in a whirlpool created by a combination of winds, currents and a <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trench,</b> several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a 450 ft ocean liner could be created as suggested.|$|E

50|$|Hotspot volcanoes are {{considered}} to have a fundamentally different origin from island arc volcanoes. The latter form over subduction zones, at converging plate boundaries. When one oceanic plate meets another, the denser plate is forced downward into a <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trench.</b> This plate, as it is subducted, releases water into {{the base of the}} over-riding plate, and this water mixes with the rock, thus changing its composition causing some rock to melt and rise. It is this that fuels a chain of volcanoes, such as the Aleutian Islands, near Alaska.|$|E

5000|$|Marine {{scientists}} {{prepare to}} leave their underwater Oceanlab after an extended stay performing oceanographic research. An underwater earthquake interrupts their plans. Dr. Andrews (Walter Pidgeon) enlists experimental sub captain Adrien Blake (Ben Gazzara) to survey the damage and rescue the oceanauts. He brings along Chief Diver [...] "Mack" [...] MacKay (Ernest Borgnine) and Dr. Leah Jansen (Yvette Mimieux), fiancée {{of one of the}} scientists. Blake finds the lab has been ripped from its moorings and has tumbled down an unexplored, <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trench,</b> presumably intact. With the lab's reserve air supply dwindling, the team descends into the unexplored trench and finds an incredible ecosystem populated with monstrously oversized fish. After surviving encounters with unfriendly denizens, they find the lab partially intact, the surviving scientists breathing from scuba tanks, and fending off giant, hungry eels. All but one of the scientists are rescued, and the submarine returns to the surface.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores the potential advantage of <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trench</b> placement of an acoustic sensor network.

50|$|In hydrology, an oceanic basin may be {{anywhere}} on Earth that {{is covered by}} seawater, but geologically ocean basins are large geologic basins that are below sea level. Geologically, there are other undersea geomorphological features such as the continental shelves, the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trenches,</b> and the undersea mountain ranges (for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Emperor Seamounts) which are {{not considered to be}} part of the ocean basins; while hydrologically, oceanic basins include the flanking continental shelves and shallow, epeiric seas.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{potential}} temperature applies to any stratified fluid. It is {{most frequently used}} in the atmospheric sciences and oceanography. The reason that it is usedin both fluids is that changes in pressure result in warmer fluid residing under colder fluid- examples being the fact that air temperature drops as one climbs a mountain and water temperature can increase with depth in very <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trenches</b> and within the ocean mixed layer. When potential temperature is used instead, these apparently unstable conditions vanish.|$|R

50|$|The {{benthic region}} of the ocean begins at the shore line (intertidal or eulittoral zone) and extends {{downward}} along {{the surface of the}} continental shelf out to sea. The continental shelf is a gently sloping benthic region that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about 200 meters deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor.

50|$|Josiah Willard Gibbs {{became the}} {{principal}} research vessel of the Hudson Laboratories of Columbia University, {{under contract to}} the Office of Naval Research. For thirteen years she provided transportation, accommodations, and working spaces for American scientists and technicians investigating physical, chemical, and biological properties of the ocean. She was dedicated primarily to research in the physics of the ocean, particularly the propagation of sound, as part of efforts by the Office of Naval Research to improve the U.S. Navy's submarine and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Her relatively large size allowed her to handle heavier weights at greater depths and provide greater stability for delicate scientific measurements than any other oceanographic research vessel then in use.

Individual species of tardigrades can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms, including complete global mass extinction events due to astrophysical events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, large asteroid impacts, or passing-by stars. Some tardigrades can withstand temperatures down to 1 K (close to absolute zero) while others can withstand 420 K for several minutes, pressures about six times greater than those found in the <b>deepest</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>trenches,</b> ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer space.

Tardigrades, living in harsh conditions, undergo an annual process of cyclomorphosis.|$|R
