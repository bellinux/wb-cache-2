40|$|According to US Energy Information Administration coal is {{predicted}} to be the dominant source of power production in the United States until 2035. With {{fifty percent of the}} electricity generated in the United States originating from coal, the US produces close to 2 billion tons of CO 2 per year from coal-burning power plants. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) offers a cleaner way to generate electricity-using coal. IGCC is a process where the feedstock is gasified and converted into to syngas (CO-H 2) which can then be used as a fuel source to power energy-generating gas turbines. Compared to other hydrocarbons, high hydrogen content fuels behave differently because of their much higher specific heat, higher diffusivity, flammability limits and higher laminar flame speed. The design of a fuel injector plays a vital role in terms of mixing which impacts flame stability inside a high-pressure gas turbine combustor (HPTC). The combustor used for experiments in this thesis has the capability to operate at pressures up to 1. 5 MPa and temperatures up to 2400 K. A detailed and effective control and ignition system was developed as part of this work to operate with the combustion chamber. The modified ignition system is used to create a pilot flame. A LabVIEW program was introduced to operate the combustor remotely. Stability was of interest for the experiments since when designing combustion devices it is necessary to know the stability regions, this way stable operation can be maintained. For this thesis flame flashback and flame blowout were defined to be outside of the stable operating conditions. The flashback tendency of the flames was determined to be dependent on the flame speed of the hydrogen. It was also observed that due to the boundary layer effect the central <b>injector</b> <b>ports</b> received the maximum flow rates, resulting in premature flashback in the outer <b>injector</b> <b>ports.</b> As the hydrogen concentration was increased, the flame became less susceptible to blowout.

40|$|Pressure {{oscillations}} {{are often}} observed in regenerative liquid propellant guns (RLPGs). They originate during combustion and {{travel through the}} gun chamber and down the gun tube. Analyses of data from medium and large caliber gun firings reveal that the dominant frequencies can vary from a few kHz to about 60 kHz. The frequency depends, at least in part, on chamber dimensions, suggesting the pressure variations are reinforced by wave reflections forming acoustic types of oscillations. Some frequencies may depend on {{the dimensions of the}} <b>injector</b> <b>ports</b> and possibly mechanical vibration of system components. They may further depend on complex flow interactions between the injected propellant and the ajdacent high temperature combustion gases. Approaches to mitigate the effect of pressure oscillations include measures to alter the mass burning rate of the propellant and various damping techniques such as cavities and liners. This paper examines the sources of pressure oscillations, vario us diagnostic tests for studying pressure oscillations, and reduction methods.

METHODS: Pigs were allocated {{to one of three}} coronary protocols (intracoronary, macrophage or control groups) or to a fourth-a pulmonary group. In the intracoronary group Cp was injected into the wall of the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA) and vehicle into the circumflex (CX). In the macrophage group autologous macrophages preincubated with Cp or not were injected into the LAD and CX wall, respectively. Animals in the control group received vehicle in LAD and CX. In the pulmonary group aerosolised Cp was given intrabronchially, after a single injection of vehicle into the LAD wall. Delivery into the coronary artery wall was performed with a balloon catheter with low-profile <b>injector</b> <b>ports.</b> RESULTS: Seroconversion occurred in the following proportions: 5 / 6 (intracoronary group), 4 / 5 (macrophage group), 0 / 6 (control group), and 1 / 6 (intrapulmonary group). Significantly higher maximal intimal thickness (MIT) was observed in LADs of intracoronary and pulmonary groups when compared to corresponding CXs. The presence of Cp antigen was associated with higher MIT (r= 0. 73; P< 0. 0001). Injection of macrophages into the coronary artery wall did not induce proliferation. Arteries without coronary interventions were morphologically normal. CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary and intrapulmonary but not macrophage-mediated Cp inoculation were associated with moderate intimal proliferation {{in the absence of a}} lipid-rich diet.

There {{is a great}} need for accurate and reliable numerical simulation of injection, mixing, and combustion in supersonic combustion ramjet engines. This study seeks to improve the accuracy and reliability which these flow can be simulated with by investigating the use of recent improvements in turbulence modeling and numerical methods. The present numerical simulations use implicit time integration and low-dissipation flux evaluation schemes in an unstructured grid framework. A hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes and large-eddy simulation approach is used to model turbulence. The large-scale turbulent structure of the flow is resolved, while the near-wall structure is fully modeled. The effects of numerics, grid resolution, and boundary conditions are investigated. The simulation approach is thoroughly validated against available experimental data {{at a variety of}} flow conditions. The simulations focus on the injection of fuel through circular <b>injector</b> <b>ports</b> that are oriented either normal to the supersonic crossflow, or at a low angle with respect to the crossflow. The instantaneous flow structure resolved by the simulations is qualitatively compared to experimental flowfield visualization. Quantitative comparisons are made to mean wall pressure, mean velocity, turbulence quantities, and mean mixing data. The simulations are found to do very well at predicting the mean flowfield as well as fluctuations in velocity and injectant concentration. The simulation approach is then used to simulate the flow within a model supersonic combustor. The focus is on the non-reacting case. The simulation results are found to agree well with experimental measurements of temperature and species concentrations. The flow is examined to improve understanding of the mixing within the model combustor. Preliminary results for a simulation including hydrogen combustion are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of improved performance {{models for the}} Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) is an important, ongoing program at NASA MSFC. These models allow prediction of overall system performance, as well as analysis of run-time anomalies which might adversely affect engine performance or safety. Due {{to the complexity of}} the flow fields associated with the SSME, NASA has increasingly turned to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques as modeling tools. An important component of the SSME system is the fuel preburner, which consists of a cylindrical chamber with a plate containing 264 coaxial injector elements at one end. A fuel rich mixture of gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen is injected and combusted in the chamber. This process preheats the hydrogen fuel before it enters the main combustion chamber, powers the hydrogen turbo-pump, and provides a heat dump for nozzle cooling. Issues of interest include the temperature and pressure fields at the turbine inlet and the thermal compatibility between the preburner chamber and injector plate. Performance anomalies can occur due to incomplete combustion, blocked <b>injector</b> <b>ports,</b> etc. The performance model should include the capability to simulate the effects of these anomalies. The current approach to the numerical simulation of the SSME fuel preburner flow field is to use a global model based on the MSFC sponsored FNDS code. This code does not have the capabilities of modeling several aspects of the problem such as detailed modeling of the coaxial injectors. Therefore, an effort has been initiated to develop a detailed simulation of the preburner coaxial injectors and provide gas phase boundary conditions just downstream of the injector face as input to the FDNS code. This simulation should include three-dimensional geometric effects such as proximity of injectors to baffles and chamber walls and interaction between injectors.

50|$|The 2GR-FSE is a 3.5L engine {{used in the}} Lexus IS, GS 350, Mark X and Crown and {{incorporates}} Toyota's latest D-4S twin injection fuel system. This system combines {{direct injection}} (949cc/min <b>injectors)</b> with traditional <b>port</b> injection (298cc/min <b>injectors).</b> Direct injection lowers the tendency to knock (detonation) and increases performance by reducing the charge intake temperature. Traditionally, direct injection engines require an in-engine mechanism such as swirl ports or specific piston crown shapes to increase air turbulence in the engine. These are in place to help achieve a homogeneous air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder at low RPM and high load, but these mechanisms inhibit performance at higher engine speeds. In the 2GR-FSE, port injection is used considerably to achieve the correct mixture without having in-engine restrictions, meaning the engine achieves specific power {{near the top of}} all naturally aspirated production gasoline engines in the world (67 kW/L, 235 kW in the Mark X). Toyota also developed a new type of injector for this engine. The dual fan spray pattern of the direct injectors is perpendicular to the piston travel with wide dispersion in the cylinder, which aids air and fuel mixture and therefore increases power and efficiency.

A potential method that may hold promise {{is the use of}} head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) sampling combines with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) separation and detection methods. This work has investigated this technique and a method has been developed to assess concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) and their derivatives from natural sources of drinking water that are used for the municipality of the Corner Brook, Newfoundland area. Under laboratory conditions, surrogate THM standard samples to include: bromodichloromethane (CHCl 2 Br), chlorodibromomethane (CHClBr 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), 1, 2 -dibromoethane (C 2 H 4 Br 2), and 1, 2 -dichloroethane (C 2 H 4 Cl 2) of known concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 ppm to cover the required analysis range) in methanol samples were analyzed in stirred and sealed vials using head space (HS-SPME) sampling. This was undertaken to fully optimize all sampling and extraction condition parameters, which included (found optimized parameters) : choice of type of extraction fiber used (PDMS/DVB), stirring rate of samples (900 rpm), extraction temperature of the sample (25 oC), extraction time required (4 min), desorption time of the fiber in the GC <b>injector</b> <b>port</b> for analysis (2 min), and the determination of maximum averaged equilibrium conditions for a number of THM analytes (4 min).

With high hydrogen content, the gaseous fuel from a gasification process of various feed stocks such as switchgrass and corn stover has high reactivity and high flashback propensity when running in the current lean premixed injectors. The research concluded that the existing C 65 microturbine combustion system, which is designed for natural gas, {{is not able to}} burn the high hydrogen content syngas due to insufficient resistance to flashback (undesired flame propagation to upstream within the fuel injector). A comprehensive literature review was conducted on high-hydrogen fuel combustion and its main issues. For Capstone?s lean premixed injector, the main mechanisms of flashback were identified to be boundary layer flashback and bulk flow flashback. Since the existing microturbine combustion system is not able to operate on high-hydrogen syngas fuels, new hardware needed to be developed. The new hardware developed and tested included (1) a series of injectors with a reduced propensity for boundary layer flashback and (2) two new combustion liner designs (Combustion Liner Design A and B) that lead to desired primary zone air flow split to meet the overall bulk velocity requirement to mitigate the risk of core flashback inside the injectors. The new injector designs were evaluated in both test apparatus and C 65 /C 200 engines. While some of the new injector designs did not provide satisfactory performance in burning target syngas fuels, particularly in improving resistance to flashback. The combustion system configuration of FFTS- 4 injector and Combustion Liner Design A was found promising to enable the C 65 microturbine system to run on high hydrogen biomass syngas. The FFTS- 4 injector was tested in a C 65 engine operating on 100 % hydrogen and with the redesigned combustion liner - Combustion Liner Design A - installed. The results were promising for the FFTS program as the system was able to burn 100 % hydrogen fuel without flashback while maintaining good combustion performance. While initial results have been demonstrated the feasibility of this program, {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these results will be repeated with FFTS- 4 injectors installed in all <b>injector</b> <b>ports</b> and over a wide range of operating conditions and fuel variations...|$|R
5000|$|Indirect {{injection}} in {{an internal}} combustion engine is fuel injection where fuel is not directly injected into the combustion chamber. In the last decade, gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein a fuel injector delivers the fuel at some point before the intake valve, have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Toyota have developed a 'dual injection' system, combining direct <b>injectors</b> with <b>port</b> (indirect) <b>injectors,</b> combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection. Direct injection allows the fuel to be precisely metered into the combustion chamber under high pressure {{which can lead to}} greater power, fuel efficiency. The issue with direct injection is that it typically leads to greater amounts of particulate matter and with the fuel no longer contacting the intake valves, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves over time. Adding indirect injection keeps fuel spraying on the intake valves, reducing or eliminating the carbon accumulation on intake valves and in low load conditions, indirect injection allows for better fuel-air mixing. This system is mainly used in higher cost models due to the added expense and complexity.|$|R
30|$|GC-MS {{analysis}} was performed as per [30] in separated fraction of fern extract under column chromatography. Chemical {{analysis was}} performed using a gas chromatograph (Trace Ultra GC) interfaced with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (DSQ II) (Thermo Scientific Co.), Chromatographic separation was achieved with DB- 35 MS fused silica capillary column (30  m X 0.25  mm ID X 0.25  μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium with a purity of 99.999 % {{was used as the}} carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0  mL min[*]−[*] 1. One μL of extract was injected in splitless mode using an auto sampler. The <b>injector</b> <b>port,</b> interface and ion source temperatures were set at 250, 260 and 250  °C, respectively. The GC temperature was programmed as follows: 75  °C (2  min), 10  °C min[*]−[*] 1 ramp to 150  °C, 5  °C min[*]−[*] 1 ramp to 250  °C, and 10  °C min[*]−[*] 1 ramp to 260  °C (10  min hold). The mass spectrometer was operated in electron ionization (EI) mode at 70  eV and at an emission current of 60  μA. Full scan data was obtained in a mass range of m/z 50 – 650. Scanning interval and SIM sampling rate were 0.5 and 0.2  s, respectively. The mass selective detector was operated in Total Ion Current monitoring (TIC) mode. The identification of peaks was based on the use of reference standards and NIST 11 and Wiley 9 library. The mass spectra obtained were inspected manually and only those molecules with probability matching higher were considered.|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} a method for {{measuring}} barbiturates (butalbital, secobarbital, pentobarbital, and phenobarbital) in whole blood samples. To accomplish these measurements, analytes were extracted by means of hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction in the three-phase mode. Hollow-fiber pores were filled with decanol, and a solution of sodium hydroxide (pH 13) was introduced into the lumen of the fiber (acceptor phase). The fiber was submersed in the acidified blood sample, and the system was subjected to an ultrasonic bath. After a 5 min extraction, the acceptor phase was withdrawn from the fiber and dried under a nitrogen stream. The residue was reconstituted with ethyl acetate and trimethylanilinium hydroxide. An aliquot of 1. 0 mu L of this solution was injected into the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, with the derivatization reaction occurring in the hot <b>injector</b> <b>port</b> (flash methylation). The method proved to be simple and rapid, and {{only a small amount}} of organic solvent (decanol) was needed for extraction. The detection limit was 0. 5 mu g/mL for all the analyzed barbiturates. The calibration curves were linear over the specified range (1. 0 to 10. 0 mu g/mL). This method was successfully applied to postmortem samples (heart blood and femoral blood) collected from three deceased persons previously exposed to barbiturates.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} flow {{physics of}} the interaction between an array of fuel jets and a hypersonic boundary layer is investigated. Hydrogen is injected at jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratios ranging from 0. 350 to 0. 875 on a flat plate into a Mach 4. 5 crossflow. The injection array consists of four streamwise-aligned flush circular portholes. Both the streamwise spacing and jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratio are varied in a parametric study. The injection was performed completely within the boundary layer, with the intention of application to film-cooling drag reduction and boundary-layer combustion. Numerical simulations of four streamwise-aligned transverse sonic injectors in a fully turbulent hypersonic boundary layer revealed a very complex jet interaction flowfield. Variation of the streamwise <b>injector</b> <b>port</b> spacing, along with the jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratio, induced a variety of flow structures in the cases investigated. For all downstream interactions, the associated flow behavior was found to be a direct result of both the various upstream effects and interactions between adjacent injectors. Variations in the jet-tofreestream dynamic pressure ratio had a strong effect on the flow behavior. At low injection mass flow rates, coupling of adjacent injectors was small, whereas high mass flow rates increased the effect of jet-to-jet coupling. Variations in the streamwise jet-to-jet spacing were also found to {{play a critical role in}} the flow behavior. At very close spacings, intense interactions coupled the behavior of the individual jets; however, at increased spacings, the larger spatial freedom allowed individual jets to develop more naturally, leading to less jet-to-jet interactions. At the maximum spacing investigated, the jet interactions behaved more like discrete jets in crossflow...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{structures}} of the <b>port</b> <b>injector</b> spray dominates the mixture preparation process and strongly affect the subsequent engine combustion characteristics {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions in port-injection gasoline engines. All these spray characteristics are determined by particular injector design and operating conditions. In this paper, an experimental study is made to characterize the breakup mechanism and spray characteristics of a injector with multi-disc nozzle (SAGEM,D 2159 MA). A comparison was made on injection characteristics of the multi-hole injectors and its effects on various fuel pressure and temperature. The distributions of the droplet size and velocity and volume flux were characterized using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) technique. Through this work, {{it was found that the}} injector produces a finer spray with a wide spray angle in higher fuel pressure and temperature. ...|$|R

Problem statement: The regular development of internal combustion engines change direction to answer the two most important problems determining the development trends of engines technology and in particular, their combustion systems. They were environmental protection against emission and noise, shortage of hydrocarbon fuels, specific fuel consumption and other technical and economic parameters. Approach: Several alternative fuels has been recognized as having a significant potential for producing lower overall pollutant emissions compared to diesel fuel. Natural gas, which composed predominately by identified as a leading candidate for transportation applications among these fuels for availability, environmental compatibility and natural gas is that it can be used in conventional diesel engines. Results: Some advantages of CNG as a fuel are octane number is very good for SI engine fuel, engines can be operate with a high compression ratio, less engine emissions and less aldehydes. In the diesel engines converted or designed to run on natural gas with the port injection (sequential) or trans-intake valve-injection system, a high-speed gas jet was pulsed from the intake port through the open intake valve into the combustion chamber, where it caused effects of turbulence and charg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Converting a {{gasoline}} engine to propane (LPG) usually results in power reduction. This can be mitigated by careful {{design of the}} injection system so the heat required for evaporation of the LPG is drawn from the intake air, so it is cooled and densified, resulting {{in an increase in}} volumetric efficiency. In this work, LPG sprays were imaged using Mie and LIF imaging techniques from {{a gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) <b>injector,</b> a <b>port</b> fuel <b>injector</b> and from long and short pipes connecting a remote LPG metering valve to the injection point. Images were taken in an optically accessed pressure chamber at pressures from atmospheric to 20 bar and with fuel line pressures from 10 to 80 bar. The imaging of the pipe-coupled injection system shows that there is significant evaporation in the pipe, which amount depends on the length and diameter of the pipe. During its travel down the pipe, the injected pulse of fuel spreads out so the duration of the LPG pulse at the manifold end is, for 300 mm pipes, five times the original duration at the injector and even greater for 600 mm pipes. The narrow structure of the sprays and the amount of evaporation that occurs before the fuel enters the manifold explains the observed differences in engine torque and in-cylinder mixture temperature observed with the different systems. The spray structures with gasoline and LPG from the direct injector are similar and more sensitive t...|$|R
