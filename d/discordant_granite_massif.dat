40|$|The Sor Rondane Mountains mainly {{consist of}} Proterozoic {{metamorphic}} rocks and {{various kinds of}} Late Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic granitic rocks. The Early Paleozoic granitic rocks {{can be divided into}} two types, concordant <b>granites</b> and <b>discordant</b> <b>granites.</b> Chemical analyses of major and trace elements for the Early Paleozoic granitic rocks are presented. The <b>discordant</b> <b>granites</b> are characterized by high Ba, Sr and alkalies. In contrast, the concordant granites are high in Y and Nb and slightly low in CaO, Cr and Sr compared with the <b>discordant</b> <b>granites.</b> Most of the concordant granites are classified as within plate <b>granites</b> and the <b>discordant</b> <b>granites</b> as volcanic arc granites, based on trace elements. Mineral compositions in the granitic rocks are also related to the two granite types. Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios of ferromagnesian minerals of the concordant granites are very low, while those of the <b>discordant</b> <b>granites</b> have intermediate Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios. Anorthite contents of plagioclases in the concordant granites are low, while those of the <b>discordant</b> <b>granites</b> have slightly high anorthite content compared with those of the concordant granites. These chemical features and the Sr initial ratios may suggest that these two granite types were formed under different conditions...|$|R

Pb isotope systematics identified two possible scenarios {{for the source of}} Li-F granites: 1) a crust-mantle source where a mixture of MORB and continental-derived material were brought together in an orogenic environment; and 2) a type II enriched mantle source where subducted continental material could have been strongly implicated in volcanic suites.
