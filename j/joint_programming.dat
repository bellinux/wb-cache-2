40|$|Although <b>joint</b> <b>programs</b> are {{typically}} formed to reduce costs, {{recent studies have}} suggested that <b>joint</b> <b>programs</b> experience larger cost growth than non-joint programs. To explain this phenomenon, we present a model that attributes <b>joint</b> <b>program</b> cost growth to agencies’ actions to maintain or regain their autonomy. We use this model to motivate principles for architecting <b>joint</b> <b>programs</b> and outline a process {{that can be used to}} identify opportunities for reforming current <b>joint</b> <b>programs</b> or for establishing new ones. Finally, we apply our approach to analyze <b>joint</b> <b>program</b> options for NOAA’s low-earth orbiting weather satellite program and in doing so, identify several risks facing NOAA’s current program and strategies for mitigating them.

50|$|In the European Union public-public {{partnerships}} {{are used}} to coordinate national research policies to create a pan-European research system, also called the European Research Area.
