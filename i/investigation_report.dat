5|$|The GAO {{released}} its <b>investigation</b> <b>report</b> on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF <b>investigation</b> <b>report</b> incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E

5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican <b>investigation</b> <b>report</b> that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police <b>investigation</b> <b>report</b> that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E
5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of <b>Investigation</b> <b>report,</b> Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a reuse {{approach}} for <b>investigation</b> <b>reports.</b> Air <b>investigation</b> <b>reports</b> are documents containing observations, findings and recommendations made by safety analysts about incidents involving an aircraft. Reusing these complex documents {{is a considerable}} task as substantial domain knowledge is required to exploit their content. We conducted experiments using statistical techniques to acquire salient lexical relations from a corpus of reports. Keyphrase extraction and cooccurrence analysis was performed to condensate the textual content of the reports. Text alignment was applied to find associations between the sections targeted as case problems and case solutions. We illustrate lexical relationships we obtained and we discuss how these can be exploited to reuse <b>investigation</b> <b>reports.</b> Keywords: Keyphrase Extraction, Cooccurrences, Statistical Alignment. ...|$|R

In this article, work by fraud examiners can be studied in terms of maturity, where we introduce a five-stage model for investigation maturity: chaos, mess, disclosure, clarification, and investment. Based on student term papers in a financial crime class, a sample of six <b>investigation</b> <b>reports</b> are allocated to levels in the maturity model. The average score for <b>investigation</b> <b>reports</b> is level 3 disclosure, where the investigation is problem-oriented and often limited by the mandate. Based on the low average score, this article discusses privatization of law enforcement, secrecy of <b>investigation</b> <b>reports,</b> lack of disclosure to the police, competence of private investigators, and limits by investigation mandate...|$|R
