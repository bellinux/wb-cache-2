500|$|The {{thyroid gland}} and every cell that uses thyroid hormone use selenium, {{which is a}} {{cofactor}} for the {{three of the four}} known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine.

50|$|<b>Iodotyrosine</b> {{deiodinase}}, {{also known}} as <b>iodotyrosine</b> dehalogenase 1, {{is a type of}} deiodinase enzyme that scavenges iodide by removing it from iodinated tyrosine residues in the thyroid gland. These iodinated tyrosines are produced during thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The iodide that is scavenged by <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase is necessary to again synthesize the thyroid hormones. After synthesis, the thyroid hormones circulate through the body to regulate metabolic rate, protein expression, and body temperature. <b>Iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase is thus necessary to keep levels of both iodide and thyroid hormones in balance.|$|E
50|$|These enzymes {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with the <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinases that are also deiodinases, but not members of the iodothyronine family. The <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinases (unlike the iodothyronine deiodinases) do not use selenocysteine or selenium.

40|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} trace element for humans and animals. More than 95 % of total iodine is accumulated in the thyroid gland. The only known roles of iodine in metabolism are its incorporation into the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3), and into the precursor <b>iodotyrosines.</b> Both hormones have multiple functions in the energy metabolism of cells, in the growth, as a transmitte...|$|R
40|$|Thyroglobulin {{is a large}} glycosylated protein (MW 660000 daltons) {{which is}} {{synthesised}} and secreted by the thyroid cell into the follicular lumen. In the thyroglobulin molecule the <b>iodotyrosines</b> undergo oxidative coupling to form the iodothyronines thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3). Production of thyroid hormones results from micropinocytosis of iodi-nated thyroglobulin from the colloid into the thyroid cell and its hydrolysis by lysosymal enzymes. The resulting T 4 and T 3 diffuse across the basal membrane into the blood stream whilst <b>iodotyrosines</b> are de-iodinated and the iodine recycled. Thyroglobulin thus acts as the template for thyroid hormone synthesis and a storage form of inactive thyroid hormones and iodine. Thyroid function and activity are under the positive control of thyrotrophin (TSH) which stimulates many steps of thyroid cell metabolism including protein synthesis, iodothyronine synthesis, thyroglobulin secretion into the follicular lumen, and replacement of micropinocytosis of thyroglobulin by massive colloid macropinocytosis [1]. The action of TSH on the thyroid cell is mediated via adenylate cyclase activation and recent work has shown that transcription of the thyroglobulin gene is regulated by cyclic AMP [2].

40|$|As {{pointed out}} in recent reviews (1, 2), the {{synthesis}} of hormonally active materials by the thyroid gland proceeds via a sequence of seemingly discrete reactions. These may be categorized as follows: concentration of inorganic iodide from the extracellular fluid, oxidation and organic binding of iodine to yield <b>iodotyrosines,</b> and coupling of <b>iodotyrosines</b> to form the hormonally active io-dothyronines. The latter two groups of reactions occur within the matrix of the thyroglobulin mole-cule, a large molecular protein for whose syn-thesis and storage the thyroid gland is especially adapted. It seems clear that ultimately the energy for these synthetic processes, {{as well as for}} the main-tenance of glandular architecture, must derive from metabolic sources. However, little is known of how the energy released during intermediary me-tabolism is imparted to those reactions involved in hormonal biosynthesis. Previous studies have in-dicated that the iodide-concentrating function of the thyroid is dependent on oxidative processes leading to the formation of high energy phosphate bonds (3, 4). The present studies were under-taken to determine whether a comparable link to metabolic events could be delineated in the case of the next stage in hormonal synthesis, the oxi-dation of iodide and formation of monoiodotyro-sine. From the results obtained, a metabolic sequence is postulated whereby the oxidation o...|$|R

50|$|The gene {{encoding}} this enzyme {{has been}} recently identified. The sequence of amino acids of <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase is highly conserved among mammals and contains three domains. <b>Iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase is a membrane protein, with the N-terminus {{functioning as a}} membrane anchor. It forms a dimer that is domain-swapped. Initially, <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase was thought to contain only one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in each dimer, but now <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase {{is believed to have}} two FMN molecules for each homodimer. The enzyme has a characteristic α-β fold that all proteins from the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily have as well. Within the dimer interface, there are two equivalent active sites, each made from residues from both subunits. Thus, subunit association must be required for FMN binding and catalysis. Substrate binding causes a conformational change in the enzyme in order to close the active site, protecting the substrate and flavin from the solvent.|$|E
5000|$|Dehalogenation in aerobic organisms {{is usually}} done through {{oxidation}} and hydrolysis; however, <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase uses reductive dehalogenation. <b>Iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase and iodothyronine deiodinase have been determined {{as the only}} two known enzymes to catalyze reductive dehalogenation in mammals. [...] Although these two enzymes perform similar functions, they are structurally and mechanistically different. Iodothyronine deiodinase (not the enzyme that is the topic of this article) uses a selenocysteine active site for catalysis, {{is a member of}} the thioredoxin superfamily, and removes iodide only when the substrate is in a double-tyrosine form. By contrast, <b>iodotyrosine</b> deiodinase (the topic enzyme) does not require selenocysteine or cysteine for catalysis, is part of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily, and removes iodide when the substrate is a single amino acid.

Thyroid hormone is {{essential}} for growth and development, and is of special importance {{for the development of the}} central nervous system. It was for that reason that neonatal screening on congenital hypothyroidism was introduced and is now performed in many countries. Defects in thyroid hormone production are caused by sev-eral disorders in hormone synthesis and in the development of the thyroid gland (primary hypothy-roidism) or of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus (central hypothyroidism).

This lag-free temperature-sensitive process is correlated with a conversion of the lipophilic proteoglycans of the cell surface into non-lipophilic proteoglycans that accumulate in the culture medium. The released proteoglycans {{are very similar to}} their lipophilic precursors in size, buoyant density and glycosaminoglycan characteristics; however, they exhibit slightly smaller core proteins after chemical and enzymic deglycosylation. The lipophilicity of the larger-sized core proteins of the cell-associated proteoglycans is also correlated with the presence of an easily iodinatable domain; this domain is missing in the released proteoglycans. Exogenous proteases (i. e. chymotrypsin, V 8, trypsin and proteinase K) readily cleave this segment from the larger protease-resistant region of the proteoglycan structure. It is also released intact by treatment of the isolated proteoglycans with methanolic HCl. This component appears to be peptide in character, in that proteases readily degrade it and release <b>iodotyrosines</b> when the precursor has been iodinated. No evidence for the presence of covalently attached fatty acids in the cell-associated proteoglycans was found. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the altered proteoglycan metabolism that is associated with the phorbol-ester-induced terminal differentiation of certain human colon cancer cells ensues upon the activation of a membrane-localized protease that cleaves a lipophilic anchor segment from the cell surface proteoglycans...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the role of thyroidal iodine in the pathogenesis of thyroiditis in the obese strain (OS) chicken, a model of spontaneous and severe disease, we studied the effect of antithyroid drugs that reduce thyroidal iodine or prevent its metabolism. Reduction of thyroidal iodine was achieved with KClO 4, an inhibitor of iodine transport and mononitrotyrosine (MNT), a drug that promotes loss of thyroidal iodine as <b>iodotyrosines.</b> A regimen consisting of KClO 4 and MNT administration beginning in ovo and continuing after hatching reduced thyroidal infiltration to 2 % of control values and decreased thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) production for as long as 9 wk. Untreated birds had severe disease by 5 wk of age. The suppression of disease was independent of TSH, not mediated by generalized immunosuppression and reversed by excess dietary iodine. Two drugs that inhibit the metabolism of iodine, propylthiouracil (PTU) and aminotriazole, reduced thyroidal infiltration and TgAb levels, although to a lesser extent. When splenocytes from OS chickens with thyroiditis were transferred to Cornell strain (CS) chickens, a related strain that develops late onset mild disease, only the recipients that were iodine supplemented developed thyroiditis.

The binding of mAb to hTgb was not significantly inhibited {{in the presence of}} Tgb carbohydrate moieties, tyrosine, <b>iodotyrosines</b> and iodothyronines. The topology of the antigenic determinants recognized by the 10 mAb on hTgb was explored by inhibition of Tgb binding of radiolabeled mAb by the other antibodies. Six distinct clusters of reactivity were described. Localization of the antigenic determinants recognized by mAb on hTgb was attempted using tryptic fragments of hTgb to inhibit the binding of mAb to hTgb. The inhibitory effect of hydrolysis products was different for each mAb but exhibited partial analogies between mAb of the same cluster of reactivity. Anti-hTgb autoimmune antibodies (aAb) purified from sera of Graves patients cross-reacted essentially with mAb of one out of the six clusters.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] has been demonstrated that the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio is {{a critical factor in}} the control of iodination and deiodination of covalently bound tyrosyl residues in proteins and free <b>iodotyrosines</b> by peroxidase enzymes. This has been shown for myeloperoxidase (MPO) isolated from normal human polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in particular, and also for peroxidases of animal origin such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO). It has also been shown that the H 2 O 2 /l ratio exerts a controlling influence on MPO-catalysed reactions of fully iodinated tyrosines, e. g. di-iodotyrosine, and of partially and completely iodinated thyronines such as thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine. Using an in vivo model system {{it has been shown that}} MPO catalyses the sequential events of iodination, iodine exchange and de-iodination of tyrosines and, furthermore, that all three reactions are influenced by the rate of H 2 O 2 generation and the iodide concentration of the reaction medium. The action of MPO on iodothyronine substrates only affects de-iodination irrespective of whether the iodothyronine is partially iodinated, as in triiodothyronine, or completely iodinated, as in thyroxine. This MPO-catalysed de-iodination of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine can also be regulated by the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio. Moreover, the results show that MPO-catalysed iodine exchange can only occur in completely iodinated tyrosines such as diiodotyrosine (DIT). Iodine exchange in partially iodinated tyrosines such as mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) or in iodothyronines (T 3 and T 4) cannot be catalysed by MPO irrespective of the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio.

In {{addition to the}} full length molecule of 933 amino acids (TPO 1), Northern blotting and sequencing have revealed several shorter transcripts. The most abundant is a species lacking 171 nucleotides in which the alternative splicing results in the deletion of codons 533 - 590 in exon 10 (TPO 2). Evidence for TPO 2 transcripts being translated into a protein is lacking, but in Western blots TPO invariably appears as a doublet of 110 and 105 kDa. In the present study we have produced two recombinant fusion proteins for: (i) the 57 amino acids which are spliced out in TPO 2 and (ii) for the 20 amino acids which bridge the splice site (10 amino acids on both sides). Both recombinant fragments have been produced in the pMAL-cRI vector as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion, permitting their purification from a bacterial lysate on an amylose column. Rabbits have been immunized by intradermal injection of 500 micrograms of fusion protein, initially in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by two boosts, at 2 -week intervals, in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The resulting high titre immune sera (IS) were reactive with the relevant immunising antigens, when tested by ELISA. Depletion of each serum by passage through an MBP-CNBr Sepharose column allowed purification of antibodies against the relevant peptides, as demonstrated by ELISA with the appropriate fusion protein and MBP. This demonstrates that we have produced specific polyclonal antibodies for the 57 amino acids unique to TPO 1 and for the amino acid segment bridging the splice site, found in TPO 2. These polyclonal antibodies were used in Western blotting experiments with normal and Graves' thyroid membranes, in reducing and non-reducing conditions. Monoclonal 47 /C 21 which recognises a linear epitope (amino acids residues 710 - 722) common to TPO 1 and TPO 2 {{was used as a}} control.

There was no difference in the image between the normal and the Graves' thyroid. In reducing conditions, the broad signal resolved clearly into two distinct bands, one at 105 and the other at 110 kDa.
