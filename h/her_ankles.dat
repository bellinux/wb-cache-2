5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by <b>her</b> <b>ankles,</b> possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, 23-year-old Italian Maria Spelterini was {{the only}} woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope, making four {{crossings}} over 18 days. On July 12, she crossed wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet, on July 19 blind-folded, on July 22 with <b>her</b> <b>ankles</b> and wrists manacled and finally on July 26. Tightrope crossings of the falls ended—by law—in 1896, when James Hardy crossed.|$|E
25|$|Stuntwoman Ann Miles {{performed}} the spider-walk scene in November 1973. Director Friedkin deleted this scene {{just prior to}} the December 26, 1973 premiere, as he judged the scene as appearing too early in the film's plot and chose to remove it, despite screenplay writer William Peter Blatty's objection. In the book, the spider-walk is somewhat more muted, consisting of Regan following Sharon around near the floor and flicking a snake-like tongue at <b>her</b> <b>ankles.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1902, Mother Amadeus {{traveled}} to Miles City, Montana, via train. Her east-bound train crashed head-on into a west-bound train. Her hip was broken, and Mother Amadeus spent nine {{weeks in a}} hospital in Helena. The primitive system of weights attached to <b>her</b> <b>ankles</b> (used as traction to keep the hip bones in place) did not work properly, and she walked with a severe limp and used a cane {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
50|$|Wozniacki was {{scheduled}} to play many clay court tournaments. However, she injured <b>her</b> <b>ankle</b> during a practice, which put her out {{for all of the}} clay-court season.

Her handbag and driver's licence were stolen during the attack. The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|This mutoscope or What the Butler Saw arcade {{machine is}} {{possibly}} Edwardian. These tourist amusements used {{a set of}} flicking cards containing sequential photographs to simulate moving pictures; they were cheap attractions in the entrances to indoor amusement arcades on piers or on the seafront. They tended to contain quaint and voyeuristic flicks: a typical one still in use at Southend pier in 1963 had a butler peeping through a keyhole to see his lady employer showing <b>her</b> <b>ankles</b> and voluminous bloomers.|$|E

500|$|She {{spent six}} months in a {{wheelchair}} and another 18 months on crutches. Mortimer's right foot has six screws and a plate, and her left foot has two screws; <b>her</b> <b>ankles</b> are continuously sore, and occasionally lock up. During the Paralympics she told the Canadian Press that her feet were [...] "killing" [...] her, and her condition is degenerative. When Mortimer's casts were removed her walking rehabilitation was in the water, and she thinks {{she would not be}} able to walk without the aquatic rehab. Before the injury, she had 10 sessions per week in the pool (swimming [...] each session) in addition to weight training and running. After the accident her weekly threshold at the local YMCA pool was [...] and four sessions in the weight room. Her disability is not usually evident to spectators, and according to the Canadian Press she walks with a [...] "halfway normal gait." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{producing}} Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, co-director Takeshi Nozue {{had difficulty}} developing {{a framework for}} Tifa's body that was [...] "balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities." [...] Her outfit too was redesigned at this point, with emphasis on expressing those qualities, while still being pleasing to the eye. A white tank top with black zipped up vest covers her front, a pink ribbon wraps around her left biceps, and boots cover her feet. A black buttoned-up skirt covers her thighs, and she wears shorts beneath, {{with a piece of}} cloth similar to a coattail extending {{from the back of the}} skirt's waistband and ending at <b>her</b> <b>ankles.</b> While her gloves remain, they are worn only during the film's fight scenes. Her hairstyle was changed to end at the middle of her back, with the removal of the dolphin tail from her original design. This alteration was because of the difficulty of animating her original length of hair, as well as problems that arose due to its black color and lighting.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim <b>her</b> <b>ankles,</b> so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E

Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events the day of the murders.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Liz's social {{problems}} stem from past slapstick events {{that left her}} with long-suppressed traumas and phobias. For instance, in [...] "Reaganing", Liz reveals to Jack that she once ended up falling while wearing roller skates and with her underwear around <b>her</b> <b>ankles,</b> while covered by a Tom Jones poster (all while {{she was trying to}} find a bathroom to use in her house). When Jack learns she also freaked out when hearing a snippet of music in Las Vegas, she realizes that anything that reminds her of Tom Jones triggers her revulsion to sex. She was also unable to eat eggs for a long time, and Kenneth's impromptu therapy helped her understand why: her aunt's husband left her, causing the aunt to feed a pre-teen Liz unappetizing egg-based dishes while making bizarre requests for company.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 16, 1957, Plainfield {{hardware}} store owner Bernice Worden disappeared. A Plainfield resident reported that the hardware store's truck had been driven out {{from the rear of}} the building around 9:30 am. The hardware store was closed the entire day; some area residents believed this was because of deer hunting season. [...] Bernice Worden's son, Deputy Sheriff Frank Worden, entered the store around 5:00 pm to find the store's cash register open and blood stains on the floor. [...] Frank Worden told investigators that Ed Gein had been in the store the evening before his mother's disappearance, and that he would return the next morning for a gallon of antifreeze. A sales slip for a gallon of antifreeze was the last receipt written by Worden on the morning she disappeared. On the evening of the same day, Gein was arrested at a West Plainfield grocery store, and the Waushara County Sheriff's Department searched the Gein farm. A Waushara County Sheriff's deputy discovered Worden's decapitated body in a shed on Gein's property, hung upside down by ropes at her wrists, with a crossbar at <b>her</b> <b>ankles.</b> The torso was [...] "dressed out like a deer". She had been shot with a [...]22-caliber rifle, and the mutilations were made after her death.|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of <b>her</b> <b>ankles.</b> They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
