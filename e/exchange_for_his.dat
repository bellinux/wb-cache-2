5|$|After their capture, {{the pirates}} {{were held at}} a prison in Guayama before their {{transfer}} to San Juan. Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> freedom. Although {{a key component of}} modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan {{for the rest of their}} lives. On March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama.|$|E

5|$|Aspiring {{musician}} and scenester Bob Markley managed {{to join the}} group the Laughing Wind in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> connections {{in the music industry}} and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy {{in exchange for a}} large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{evidence}} linking the gang to {{a spate of}} vehicle thefts along the A1 road, Ross is unable to persuade his superior, Sergeant Pearson (Arthur Rigby), to investigate the café. He therefore pursues the matter on his own, confronting Diamond with his knowledge and forcing the gangster to bribe him in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> silence. When Pearson learns of Ross' private investigation, he threatens the officer's job, causing tension between Ross and his wife Joan (Patricia Heneghan).|$|E
50|$|In autumn 962, Theodoulos' son Theodore {{captured}} Sayf al-Dawla's cousin, Abu Firas al-Hamdani, in a raid, {{and tried}} to have <b>his</b> prisoner <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> father {{and one of his}} brothers. This was without immediate success, as Abu Firas remained a captive until the prisoner exchange of 966, when Theodoulos and any other high-ranking Byzantine captives were probably also exchanged.|$|R
25|$|By then, I. M. Melik had {{invested}} his {{money into a}} large-scale agricultural venture, on the Moldavian estate of Costeștii Botoșanilor. The purchase took place in March 1885. As he himself noted, 507 fálce of land (some 726 hectares) were <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> 210,000 lei, cash.

5|$|In the 1936 senatorial {{contest in}} Kentucky, {{incumbent}} Democrat Marvel Mills Logan {{was seen as}} vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. This endorsement drew the ire of Chandler's former ally, Democratic Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that, in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy {{for the rest of}} his political career.|$|E

Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{initially}} supported Bell's candidacy. Bell urged O'Malley {{to endorse}} him, and offered him {{the job of}} city solicitor in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> support. However, O'Malley began {{to distance himself from}} Bell, not appearing at Bell's campaign announcement, due to disagreements on several bills debated at the City Council. Bell's supporters attempted to convince O'Malley to run for City Council President, but O'Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign largely unknown outside of Northeast Baltimore.|$|E

If the story had been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence since, under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to bribe an MP.|$|E
5|$|The Pearl pursues the Interceptor, {{taking the}} crew hostage and {{destroying}} the ship. Will makes {{a deal with}} Barbossa to release Elizabeth in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, marooning Jack and Elizabeth on the island Jack was left on before. Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, and Commodore Norrington brings the HMS Dauntless to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth requests Norrington to return for Will, convincing him by accepting his marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|These changes {{brought the}} {{customary}} rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. As described above, John {{had come to}} a compromise with Pope Innocent III in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church. The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.|$|E

5|$|Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's {{hotel room}} as the 36-hour time nears, finding {{numerous}} photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him {{that he has the}} ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it.

5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
50|$|Carver {{took his}} vessel and {{returned}} home to Plymouth but realising that having helped the enemy, he would {{be viewed as a}} traitor, he concocted a story to explain his good fortune. Carver claimed that he had borrowed another boat and sailed out to Albemarle with sheep and fresh vegetables which he then <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> schooner. Nelson, Carver went on, was so overwhelmed with his kindness that he not only returned the vessel, he presented him with the letter noting his 'good services'.|$|R

Once or twice her feet slipped on the smoothly-worn rock beneath; and she confessed to an inward thankfulness when her uncertain feminine hand-grip was <b>exchanged</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> strong arm around her waist. Not that he was ungentle; but Miss Alice angrily {{felt that he had}} once or twice exercised his superior masculine functions in a rough way; and yet the next moment she would have probably rejected the idea that she had even noticed it. There was no doubt, however, that he WAS a little surly.|$|R
5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's test subjects who has a unique ability of accepting tissue and organ transplantation, Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage. Sasuke's daughter, Sarada, also eventually awakens her own Sharingan.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in <b>exchange</b> <b>for</b> <b>his</b> fealty. Henry marched via Aberystwyth while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at Cefn Digoll, Welshpool,. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of Shrewsbury.|$|E
