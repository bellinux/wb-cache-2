5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups {{and examples of}} other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, <b>every</b> <b>group</b> (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if <b>every</b> <b>group</b> element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 2014, Sheridan {{scored the}} {{equalizer}} against HJK Helsinki at Sonera Stadium, in APOEL's 2–2 first leg draw {{for the third}} qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. One week later, he scored again in the return leg against HJK Helsinki, opening the scoring in APOEL's 2–0 home victory and advancement to the play-off round of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. On 26 August 2014, he scored the fourth goal in APOEL's 4–0 thriumph over Aalborg BK for the UEFA Champions League play-off round, helping his team to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Sheridan appeared in <b>every</b> <b>group</b> stage match in APOEL's 2014–15 UEFA Champions League campaign. On 25 May 2015, one day after winning his second consecutive double with APOEL, the team announced that Sheridan was leaving the club as his contract would not be renewed.|$|E

50|$|A {{group whose}} perfect core is trivial is termed a hypoabelian <b>group.</b> <b>Every</b> {{solvable}} <b>group</b> is hypoabelian, {{and so is}} <b>every</b> free <b>group.</b> More generally, <b>every</b> residually solvable <b>group</b> is hypoabelian.|$|R

50|$|In fact, every AE(0) {{space is}} the {{continuous}} {{image of a}} Cantor cube, and with some effort one can prove that <b>every</b> compact <b>group</b> is AE(0).

25|$|<b>Every</b> <b>group</b> G can {{itself be}} thought of as a left or right G-torsor under the natural action of left or right multiplication.|$|E
25|$|Frucht's theorem {{says that}} <b>every</b> <b>group</b> is the {{symmetry}} group of some graph. So every abstract group {{is actually the}} symmetries of some explicit object.|$|E
25|$|<b>Every</b> <b>group</b> has a presentation, {{and in fact}} many {{different}} presentations; a presentation is often the most compact way of describing {{the structure of the}} group.|$|E

50|$|For <b>every</b> finite <b>group,</b> {{there exists}} a graph with that group as its group of automorphisms, with {{distinguishing}} number two. This result extends Frucht's theorem that <b>every</b> finite <b>group</b> can be realized as the group of symmetries of a graph.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, as Otto Hölder showed, <b>every</b> Archimedean <b>group</b> is {{isomorphic}} (as an ordered group) to a {{subgroup of}} the real numbers.

25|$|Cayley's theorem {{states that}} <b>every</b> <b>group</b> G is {{isomorphic}} to a subgroup of the symmetric {{group on the}} elements of G, as a group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.|$|E

25|$|The {{symmetric}} group {{is important to}} diverse areas of mathematics such as Galois theory, invariant theory, the representation theory of Lie groups, and combinatorics.

25|$|Former President Caret {{established}} {{a program called}} Adopt-A-Campus, which gives local businesses, organizations and others an opportunity to help beautify the TU campus. <b>Every</b> <b>group</b> is assigned a certain section of the campus, and will be encouraged to pick up litter and help keep the area clean of trash and debris.|$|E
25|$|<b>Every</b> <b>group</b> G can {{be viewed}} as a {{category}} with a single object; morphisms in this category are just the elements of G.

25|$|Berger's {{list was}} later {{shown to be}} incomplete: further {{examples}} were found by R. Bryant (1991) and by Q. Chi, S. Merkulov, and L. Schwachhöfer (1996). These are sometimes known as exotic holonomies. The search for examples ultimately led to a complete classification of irreducible affine holonomies by Merkulov and Schwachhöfer (1999), with Bryant (2000) showing that <b>every</b> <b>group</b> on their list occurs as an affine holonomy group.|$|E
25|$|For a {{prime number}} p, a Sylow p-{{subgroup}} (sometimes p-Sylow subgroup) {{of a group}} G is a maximal p-subgroup of G, i.e. a subgroup of G that is a p-group (so that the order of <b>every</b> <b>group</b> element is a power of p) {{that is not a}} proper subgroup of any other p-subgroup of G. The set of all Sylow p-subgroups for a given prime p is sometimes written Sylp(G).|$|E
25|$|A group {{automorphism}} {{is a group}} isomorphism from a {{group to}} itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For <b>every</b> <b>group</b> G {{there is a natural}} group homomorphism G → Aut(G) whose image is the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms and whose kernel is the center of G. Thus, if G has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group.|$|E
