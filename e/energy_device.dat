40|$|Purpose Oceans offer a {{vast amount}} of {{renewable}} energy. Tidal and wave <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> are currently the most advanced conduits of ocean energy. To date, only a few life cycle assessments for ocean energy have been carried out for ocean energy. This study analyses ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices,</b> including all technologies currently being proposed, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of their environmental impacts and explore how they can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply. Methods The study followed the methodology of life cycle assessment including all life cycle steps from cradle to grave. The various types of device were assessed, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 kWh of electricity delivered to the grid. The impact categories investigated were based on the ILCD recommendations. The life cycle models were set up using detailed technical information on the components and structure of around 180 ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> from an in-house database. Results and discussion The design of ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> still varies considerably, and their weight ranges from 190 to 1270 t, depending on device type. Environmental impacts are closely linked to material inputs and are caused mainly by mooring and foundations and structural components, while impacts from assembly, installation and use are insignificant for all device types. Total greenhouse gas emissions of ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> range from about 15 to 105 g CO 2 -eq. kWh− 1. Average global warming potential for all device types is 53 [*]±[*] 29 g CO 2 -eq. kWh− 1. The results of this study are comparable with those of other studies and confirm that the environmental impacts of ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> are comparable with those of other renewable technologies and can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply. Conclusions Ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> are still at an early stage of development compared with other renewable energy technologies. Their environmental impacts can be further reduced by technology improvements already being pursued by developers (e. g. increased efficiency and reliability). Future life cycle assessment studies should assess whole ocean energy arrays or ocean energy farms. JRC. C. 7 -Knowledge for the Energy Unio...|$|R
40|$|The {{differences}} between the task of designing safe mooring systems for large floating platforms of {{the oil and gas}} offshore industry, that have severe accident consequences, and the task of designing moorings for ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices,</b> with reduced accident consequences, are discussed. None of the existing guidelines satisfy the needs of wave <b>energy</b> <b>devices.</b> These guidelines do not consider the working principles of the devices, are too demanding as to safety or too simple and lead to expensive solutions. Wave <b>energy</b> <b>devices</b> will require a new set of design guidelines containing a new low consequence class, since mooring failure will not lead to “unacceptable consequences such as loss of life and uncontrolled outflow of oil or gas”. It should be up to the owner, insurance company and investors to balance their economic risks above a certain minimum safety level. A deeper analysis of mooring systems for ocean <b>energy</b> <b>devices,</b> compared to what is demanded for offshore oil and gas platforms, is required to properly assess the effect on the power take-off and survivability, the latter leading to economical benefits from a possible low consequence clas...|$|R
