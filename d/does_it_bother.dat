5000|$|Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club {{described}} {{the film as}} a flimsily [...] "feel-good," [...] surface-level exploration of the girls' experience, and noted that some crucial contextual information was missing: [...] "The Baltimore Leadership School For Young Women itself is painted in the best light, {{but of course it}} would be; Lipitz’s mother founded it, a fact that Step doesn’t feel the need to acknowledge. Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>bother</b> {{to mention the fact that}} the filmmaker’s father has an entire center named after him at Johns Hopkins, where he was formerly on the board of trustees. It might not teach you to be a documentarian, but money sure can buy some uplifting endings." ...|$|E

American tennis player Serena Williams was noted by the media for exposing her navel piercing during her matches.Similarly, retired Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova was known for frequent navel exposure during her matches. In 2009, for an interview to the German magazineDer Spiegel when asked about her belly button showing during serves, she commented, [...] "These are men's ravings.Why you should hide it, when it isn't necessary? Female beach volley ball players play in bikinis - <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>bother</b> anyone?"American female golfer Laura Diaz commenting to LPGA for Sports Illustrated, [...] "The LPGA needs to acknowledge {{that a lot of}} people watch women's sports more for the women than for the sports. Why else would Anna Kournikova, who has never won a singles title, be the most popular player in women's tennis? We have quite a few attractive women, and we should use our looks to our advantage. After all, what's so wrong with seeing an occasional belly button?" ...|$|E

Although there was {{a fair amount of}} disruption for the children, they <b>did</b> not let <b>it</b> <b>bother</b> them and dealt with all aspects of the changes extremely maturely. Spring 2015 finally brought an end to the redevelopment and the end product very good and the children loved the new lay out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{general idea}} for these {{ground-breaking}} clerical artists {{was that there}} was no religious denomination for art. [...] "What is more real? The torments of the figure of Christ or the beautiful expensive necklace you are wearing?" [...] the priest asked a parishioner who was criticizing the novel way in which Germaine Richier had symbolised the Christ in Agony in the new church at Assy. Another example: [...] "But don't you know I am a Jew?" [...] Jacques Lipchitz had asked Father Couturier, when commissioned to deliver the sculpture of the Virgin Mary for Assy. [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> you, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> me" [...] was the answer.|$|R

He had just seen Buster Bear for the first time, {{and what do you}} think had impressed him most? Well, it wasn't Buster's great size, or wonderful strength, or big claws, or deep, grumbly-rumbly voice. No, Sir, it wasn't one of these. It was the fact that Buster Bear seemed to have no tail! Peter couldn't get over that. He almost pitied Buster Bear. You see, Peter has a great admiration for fine tails. He has always been rather ashamed of the funny little one he has himself. Still, it is a real tail, and he has often comforted himself with that thought.|$|R

[...] "A lot of horses can't travel around {{like that and}} still race good," [...] said Teague. [...] "He's the exception. I've never seen <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> hasn't <b>bothered</b> him yet. Harrington is his home, but we've only raced him there once. It seems like everywhere has been his home track.

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{praised the}} episode saying, [...] "Body of Proof threw just enough curves {{to keep me}} guessing this week and provided enough personal interaction between our characters to {{make me want to}} tune in for more". She praised the interaction between Megan and Lacey calling their conversation [...] "cute", adding [...] "It's nice to watch Megan make extra time to spend with her daughter". She called the Alan's actions [...] "pathetic" [...] for trying to apologize to Martin for killing his wife saying, [...] "You've got to be kidding!". Orlando added that she did not [...] "see coming" [...] Martin's reaction to the apology; he shot Alan, stating [...] "I could understand the sentiment". She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease.

I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the devastating}} Olympic loss, Morozov <b>did</b> not let <b>it</b> <b>bother</b> {{him on the}} ice as he led Ak-Bars to their second {{straight}} Gagarin Cup as KHL champions. The 2009-10 season was an up and down one for Morozov as he battle injuries down the stretch {{in the second half}} of the KHL season where he missed several key playoff games and even had to miss the 2010 World Championships, where Team Russia would lose for the first time in over 3 years without their Captain and have to settle for Silver.|$|R

Ah I how it grated on my soul that he should be so happy! Other men could laugh, and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> me. I even used to laugh myself--before I met John Claverhouse.|$|R

Quinn moved his seat in the chamber to one next to a statue of the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, whom Barron has criticized.

From the article: [...] "He's just making graphic what's already in the paper every day," [...] says Bugbee, who got involved when Diana told him he was going to stop publishing. [...] "I said that was horrible," [...] he recalls. [...] "I told him that I would <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and when they got me and shut me down then someone else would do it." [...] Diana, he confirms, [...] "is very quiet and soft-spoken. He's really ultrasensitive: that's why he chooses the subject matter he <b>does.</b> <b>It</b> really <b>bothers</b> him." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009 he {{along with}} Chinese colleagues had studied nitric oxide in {{combination}} with nitrate reductase in both cold and freezing temperature on a plant species called Arabidopsis thaliana. He discovered that when combining this with both nia1nia2 and nitric oxide associated leaves the cold doesn't bother the plants as much, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>bother</b> its seedings. He also discovered proline in wild plants and used nitrate reductase inhibitor with nitric oxide scavenger and donor to prove that there is positive correlation between them {{when it comes to}} freezing temperature.|$|R

5000|$|Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a highly praiseworthy {{pictorial}} {{interpretation of the}} stage work" [...] and added, [...] "It is an intelligently worked out film, thanks to the director, George Cukor, and while <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> much about cinematic art, the scenes are always beautifully photographed and nicely staged. It has heaps of amusement and some hearty laughter, and Mr. Maugham's fine hand still is apparent notwithstanding certain tactful studio changes." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{effective}} predator is {{the mountain}} lion. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> with quill avoidance, but tolerates them. Some individuals {{have been found}} with dozens of quills embedded in their gums to no ill effect. It can climb trees, so its favorite method is to position itself below the porcupine and knock it to the ground, where it is quickly dispatched. Other predators can attack, such as wolves, lynx, and great horned owls, but do not pose much of a threat.|$|R

In Colombia, all [...] "war-like" [...] toys are strictly prohibited, which is why replicas are labeled as pneumatic guns.|$|R
60|$|Next {{moment he}} was on the shelf and shouted with laughter. Sometimes Deering's humor was boyishly rude, but his friends were not cheated, and Jimmy thought the big man keen and resolute. Stannard went up lightly, as if <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> him. He was cool and, by {{contrast}} with Deering, looked fastidiously refined. Jimmy imagined he had an object for leaving the gully. Stannard knew the mountains; in fact, he knew all a sporting gentleman ought to know and Jimmy was satisfied with his guide.|$|R
2500|$|The Fathers {{were well}} aware of the {{discrepancy}} of some hundreds of years between the Greek and Hebrew Old Testament chronology, and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> them; they did not quibble over years or worry that the standard calendar was precise [...] "to the very year"; it is sufficient that what is involved is beyond any doubt a matter of some few thousands of years, involving the lifetimes of specific men, and it can in no way be interpreted as millions of years or whole ages and races of men.|$|R
50|$|The Great Mother {{exists to}} remake the multiverse in its image by filling it with its spawn, {{replacing}} all forms of life with monsters that resemble the Mother itself. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> not <b>bother</b> to acquire knowledge as Ilsensine and Boccob <b>do,</b> because <b>it</b> has always known all that it could ever need to know. However, it cannot or will not communicate this knowledge to lesser beings, including its own offspring. It neglects its children, not bothering with omens or portents. Sometimes it will allow beholders to be entirely wiped out on a given world, while other times it will become enraged when even a small beholder community is threatened.|$|R

2500|$|The album's six {{original}} {{tracks are}} credited to Anderson with either Squire or David Foster, Anderson's former bandmate in The Warriors. Banks said he made {{contributions to the}} writing of the album, but his name {{was not included in the}} credits. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> him at first, but it caused some discontent years later when he missed out on royalties. Time and a Word marked a development in Anderson's lyric content, who began to move from simple love themes to topics of greater scale, described by band biographer Dan Hedges as [...] "life, oneness and the future".|$|R
60|$|He had no {{fire that}} night, nor hot water, and crawled under his blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep. The snow {{turned into a}} cold rain. He awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face. Day came--a gray day and no sun. It had ceased raining. The keenness of his hunger had departed. Sensibility, as far as {{concerned}} the yearning for food, had been exhausted. There was a dull, heavy ache in his stomach, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> him so much. He was more rational, and once more he was chiefly interested {{in the land of}} little sticks and the cache by the river Dease.|$|R
5000|$|Although Pankhurst {{describes}} this reunion as [...] "most romantic", Dr. Martin's own immediate response was remarkably distant. Bahru Zewde notes that [...] "his diary gives a distinctly chilly impression of {{his return to}} his motherland and reunion with his relatives. He viewed the exuberance and excitement of his kin with clinical detachment, expressing scepticism about the identities of his maternal grandmother, Emahoy Salamnesh, his aunt and his half-sister". Bahru explains much of his response was due to [...] "the culture shock {{that he must have}} gone through", and notes that either he must have confined his aloofness to his diary, or <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not <b>bother</b> his relatives who were [...] "earnestly trying to find a bride for him." ...|$|R

Nowadays there are 2000 pure-bred dogs in the official registry of the Bull Boxer Club - however, the number also includes many dogs that have already died.
