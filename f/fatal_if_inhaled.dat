25|$|Water {{has several}} {{systematic}} names, including oxidane (the IUPAC name), hydrogen oxide, and dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO). The latter {{was the basis}} of the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, a document that was circulated warning readers of the dangers of the chemical (for example, it is <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled).</b>|$|E
2500|$|A 1983 April Fools' Day {{edition of}} the Durand Express, a weekly {{newspaper}} in Durand, Michigan, reported that [...] "dihydrogen oxide" [...] {{had been found in}} the city's water pipes, and warned that it was <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> and could produce blistering vapors. The first appearance of the hoax on the internet was attributed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to the so-called [...] "Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide", a parody organization at UC Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and newsgroup discussions in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|Methacryloyloxyethyl {{isocyanate}} is {{an extremely}} poisonous liquid which can be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> absorbed through skin, or consumed orally.

50|$|Lead oxide may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> {{swallowed}} or <b>inhaled.</b> It causes irritation to skin, eyes, {{and respiratory}} tract. It affects gum tissue, central nervous system, kidneys, blood, and reproductive system. It can bioaccumulate in plants and in mammals.|$|R
25|$|Ingestion of {{kerosene}} {{is harmful}} or fatal. Kerosene is sometimes recommended as a folk remedy for killing head lice, but health agencies warn against this {{as it can}} cause burns and serious illness. A kerosene shampoo can even be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> fumes are <b>inhaled.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ethyl bromoacetate is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH2BrCO2C2H5. It is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid and is prepared in two steps from acetic acid. It is a lachrymator {{and has a}} fruity, pungent odor. It is also a highly toxic alkylating agent and may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mercury(I) sulfate, {{commonly}} called mercurous sulphate (UK) or mercurous sulfate (US) is the chemical compound Hg2SO4. Mercury(I) sulfate is a metallic compound that is white, pale yellow or beige powder. It is a metallic salt of sulfuric acid formed by replacing both hydrogen atoms with mercury(I). It is highly toxic; {{it could be}} <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> ingested, or absorbed by skin.|$|E
5000|$|H300+H310+H330: <b>Fatal</b> <b>if</b> swallowed, {{in contact}} with skin or <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fatal</b> <b>if</b> {{swallowed}} or <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> It causes weakness, headache, confusion, {{nausea and}} vomiting.|$|R
50|$|According to a manufacturer, {{potential}} hazards include violent reaction {{with water}} {{and the production of}} explosive hydrogen vapors upon contact with most metals; chronic (delayed) and acute (immediate) health hazards <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> ingested, or contacted, including severe eye, flesh and skin burns or even permanent visual loss, inflammation of respiratory membranes, and corrosive burns to all human tissue. It may even be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> swallowed. Due to the vigorous reaction between the acid and water, such acidic drain openers should be added slowly into the pipe to be cleaned.|$|R
50|$|As the {{charcoal}} burns, {{the concentration of}} carbon monoxide gradually increases. Because of its toxicity (and not the exhaustion of oxygen as sometimes thought) CO concentrations of as little as one part per thousand can be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> {{over a period of}} two hours. The incomplete combustion of carbon produces carbon monoxide, which binds strongly to hemoglobin, rapidly decreasing the ability of blood to deliver oxygen to the body. This results in death due to hypoxia brought about by carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E

5000|$|Physical toxicants are {{substances}} that, due {{to their}} physical nature, interfere with biological processes. Examples include coal dust, asbestos fibers or finely divided silicon dioxide, {{all of which can}} ultimately be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because they destroy tissues, but they're not directly poisonous unless they interfere directly with biological activity. Water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there's too much water in the body. Asphyxiant gases can be considered physical toxicants because they act by displacing oxygen in the environment but they are inert, not chemically toxic gases.|$|E
50|$|Cyanogen iodide is toxic <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or {{ingested}} {{and may be}} <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> swallowed or absorbed {{through the}} skin. Cyanogen iodide may cause convulsions, paralysis and death from respiratory failure. It is a strong irritant and may cause burns to the eyes and skin if contact is encountered. If cyanogen iodide is heated enough to undergo complete decomposition, it may releases toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides, cyanide and iodide. A fire may cause the release of poisonous gas. Cyanogen iodide decomposes when contacted with acids, bases, ammonia, alcohols, and with heating. ICN slowly reacts with water or carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen cyanide.|$|R
50|$|Diquat dibromide is {{moderately}} toxic. It may be <b>fatal</b> {{to humans}} <b>if</b> swallowed, <b>inhaled,</b> or absorbed {{through the skin}} in large quantities.|$|R

5000|$|The fourth section, {{with orange}} page borders, {{includes}} the actual response guides. Each of the 62 guides provides safety recommendations and directions {{on how to}} proceed during the initial response phase (first thirty minutes) of the incident. It includes [...] "health" [...] and [...] "fire or explosion" [...] potential hazard information (with the more dangerous hazard listed first). For example, [...] "the material gives off irritating vapors, easily ignited by heat, reactive with water"; [...] "highly toxic, may be <b>fatal</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> swallowed or absorbed through skin"; etc. [...] Next this section includes information for responders on appropriate protective clothing and possible evacuation information for either spill or fire is given. It also includes information on fighting fires (example, do not apply water to sodium), warnings for spills or leaks, and special directions for first aid (example, not to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the materials are toxic).|$|E

50|$|Thiram is {{moderately}} toxic by ingestion, but it {{is highly}} toxic <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Acute exposure in humans may cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints.|$|R
50|$|Liquid trifluoroacetyl {{chloride}} {{can cause}} frostbite {{if it comes}} in contact with unprotected skin. <b>If</b> <b>inhaled,</b> the compound in its gaseous state will irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Absorbing trifluoroacetyl chloride through skin, inhaling it, or ingesting it can cause death. When the compound burns, it produces toxic gases. It also corrodes the respiratory tract. The compound is also a lacrimator. It can cause dyspnea <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> by mice, rats, or guinea pigs. A concentration of 35.3 parts per million of trifluoroacetyl chloride is enough to usually kill a rat in six hours.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum {{chloride}} is a neurotoxin. Anhydrous AlCl3 reacts vigorously with bases, so suitable precautions are required. It {{can cause}} irritation to the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or on contact.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{non-toxic}} tendencies, cryogenic fuels are denser than air. As such, {{they can}} lead to asphyxiation. If leaked, the liquid will boil into a very dense, cold gas and <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> could be <b>fatal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dimethylacetamide is {{a medium}} potency {{reproductive}} toxicant (toxic for reproduction, category 1B) and may damage fertility or the unborn child. It is harmful {{in contact with}} skin or <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> and causes serious eye irritation.|$|R
