5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> subscribe to their views. But let there be no violence or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E

500|$|... "Bad Romance" [...] is an electropop and dance-pop {{song with}} house, new wave and techno influences. According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 119 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want you, And you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need you, I want your bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I want your love, And I want your revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E

[...] In one speech, he stated that [...] "something is wrong with capitalism" [...] and claimed, [...] "There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{record is}} {{separated}} into three sections: [...] "The Heirophant", [...] "Inauguration of the Worm", and [...] "Disintegrator Rising". In the final section, the central character transforms into the Antichrist Superstar: an epicurean demagogue whose motivations transcend any conceivable sense of morality. Nihilistic and disgusted by humankind, it initiates a genocidal extermination {{of the human}} race, eventually destroying the entire planet. The album is also cyclical, with both its opening and closing seconds consisting of the distorted phrase [...] "When you are suffering, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have betrayed you".|$|E
500|$|Margaret {{also offered}} many {{insights}} into other Salinger myths, including her father's supposed long-time interest in macrobiotics, and involvement with [...] "alternative medicine" [...] and Eastern philosophies.

500|$|The protagonist accepts {{that her}} {{feelings}} for her lover are too strong, {{and that she}} does not have the courage to leave him.

Despite the desire to have her lover back, she sings, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love you {{but let me just say}} / I don't want to love you in no kind of way". The woman gains confidence, and towards the end of the song, she wants to spend her life with her lover despite the previous letdowns.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, and I know that you may love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E

McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics [...] "'Hate is what I feel for you/I want you to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want you dead'" [...] which were [...] "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to [...] "steal money and belongings and run off to California." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 21, 2005, {{the day of}} {{the release}} of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page {{advertisements}} in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band.
