60|$|Sermons were, however, never Patteson's forte. Though his pen flowed so {{freely in}} letters, {{and he could}} pour out his heart extemporaneously with great depth, fervour and simplicity, his sermons were laboured and metaphysical, {{as if he had}} taken too much pains with them as it were, and he could not speak to the abstract, as he could to the individual, or when he saw the effect of his words. It was perhaps owing to the <b>defective</b> <b>system</b> which threw two sermons a week upon a young deacon at a time when his mind was working through such an {{experimental}} course of study and thought. Yet his people, who had learnt to believe in little but preaching, would not have come to prayers alone; and the extemporary addresses, in which he would probably have been much more successful, would have seemed to him at his age and at that period--twenty years back--too presumptuous to be attempted, at any rate till he had better learnt his ground. How his system would have succeeded, we cannot tell. The nature of the peasantry of the county he had to deal with is, to be quick-witted, argumentative, and ready of retort; open to religious impressions, but with much of self-opinion and conceit, and not much reverence, and often less conscientious in matters of honesty and morality than denser rustics of less apparent piety. The Church had for a long-period been at a peculiarly low ebb in the county, and there is not a neighbourhood which has not traditions of incredibly ignorant, careless and underbred--if not dissipated-- clergy; and though there were grand exceptions, they were only respected as men; faith in the whole system, as a system, was destroyed. Bishop Phillpotts, coming down on such elements as these, was, in spite of his soundness of faith and grand trenchant force of character, better as a warrior than as a shepherd, and the controversial and political sides of his character, though invaluable to the Church, did not recommend him to the affections of the people of his diocese, who could not understand the points of the debate, and wanted the direct evidence of spirituality which they could appreciate.|$|E

Perhaps partly due to the release date, the DS met unexpectedly high demand in the United States, selling 1 million units by December 21, 2004. As of the end of December, the total number shipped worldwide was 2.8 million, about 800,000 more than Nintendo's original forecast. At least 1.2 million of them were sold in the U.S. Some industry reporters are referred to it as [...] "the Tickle Me Elmo of 2004". In June 2005, Nintendo informed the press that a total of 6.65 million units had been sold worldwide.As is normal for electronics, some were reported as having problems with stuck pixels in either of the two screens. Return policies for LCD displays vary between manufacturers and regions, however in North America, Nintendo has chosen to replace a system with fixed pixels only if the owner claims that it interferes with their gaming experience. There are currently two exchange programs in place for North America.

The Soyuz programme was intended to rejuvenate the program by developing space rendezvous and docking capability, and practical extravehicular activity without tiring the cosmonaut, as had been demonstrated by the US in Gemini.

Drawing on data developed in legislative hearings and investigations and in sworn depositions, the paper documents that managers of IISIFs in Ohio and Maryland knew well in advance of their funds' 1985 failures that important clients were both economically insolvent and engaging in inappropriate forms of risk-taking. It also establishes that staff proposals for publicizing and bringing these clients' risk-taking under administrative control were repeatedly rejected. The analysis has a forward-looking purpose.

Unless and until incentives supporting political, bureaucratic and private risk-taking are reformed, the possibility of a FSLIC meltdown cannot be dismissed. To encourage timely intervention into insolvencies developing in a deposit-insurance fund's client base, the most meaningful reforms would be to force the development and release of estimates of the market value of the insurance enterprise and to require fund managers to use the threat of takeover to force decapitalized clients to recapitalize well before they approach insolvency. ...|$|R

40|$|Tin {{monoxide}} is a technologically important p-type material {{which has}} a layered structure dictated by nonbonded dispersion forces. As standard density functional theory (DFT) approaches are unable to account for dispersion forces properly, they routinely {{give rise to a}} poor description of the unit cell structure. This study therefore applies two forms of empirical dispersion corrections, using either atomic- or ionic-based parameters for the dispersion coefficients, to assess their ability to correctly model the atomic structure and the formation energies of the important p-type defects. Although both approaches show an improvement in the predicted unit cell structure over that with no dispersion corrections, the ionic-based parameter set shows significantly better results, with lattice vectors reproduced within 0. 2 % of experiment. The atomic-based parameters still predict a distorted cell though, which is carried through to the <b>defective</b> <b>system.</b> On the introduction of defects, a similar degree of structural relaxation is observed regardless of the approach. The defect formation energies, however, are seen to differ more substantially, with the atomic-based set giving an overestimation of the energies due to excessive Sn-Sn interactions.

Other remarkable properties of semiconducting metal oxides are the display of mixed valence properties (cases of Nb, Ta, V, Mo, W or Ni oxides), (Cotton and Wilkinson 1988) and their electroactivity (Morrison 1980) that consists in the capability of being reversibly reduced and/or oxidized in the configuration of thin film (Yohe et al. 1968; Passerini and Scrosati 1994; Awais et al. 2013). Semiconducting oxides undergo also reversible solid state transitions of the type semiconductor-to-metal upon chemical/electrochemical doping (Dickens and Whittingham 1968; Masetti et al. 1995; Bueno et al. 2003). Such ensemble of features render metal oxides particularly interesting in those technologies (Smith and Granqvist 2010) based on the controlled modulation of the electrical, optical and dielectric properties. Within this class of functional materials a particularly important case is represented by nickel oxide the electrochemical (Awais et al. 2010, 2013; Marrani et al. 2014), electrochromic (Estrada et al. 1991; Decker et al. 1992) and photoelectrochemical (Awais et al. 2011, 2013; Sheehan et al. 2015) properties of which have been characterized and interpreted.
