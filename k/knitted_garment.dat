40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) A {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine whether}} <b>knit</b> <b>garments</b> require less ease than woven garments and if the ease varies inversely with the stretchability of the fabric. Students in beginning clothing construction classes donated specimens of their fabric for testing of elongation. When the garments were fitted and finished, the students and their garments were measured to determine the percentage of ease which had been incorporated. The data were ranked in order of stretchability and the mean stretch and mean ease for each of six bodylines was calculated. Means for the entire population and for several groupings of stretchability {{as well as for}} the type of knit were determined. Significant negative correlations between stretch and ease were found for the bustline, waistline, high hipline, and widest part of the hip when the population included all specimens. One specimen was of an extremely stretchable character and produced a high degree of negative ease. When this specimen was deleted, the correlations previously disclosed were no longer significant. The study indicated that the amount of ease needed in <b>knit</b> <b>garments</b> is less than in woven garments for the upper back. Bustline ease needs to be less in most <b>knit</b> <b>garments</b> than in woven ones. The amount of ease needed through the widest part of the hip is approximately the same for both <b>knit</b> and woven <b>garments.</b> Comparison of ease in the waistline, high hipline, and upper arm were inconclusive...|$|R

The textile {{industry}} {{plays a significant role}} in the Indian economy by providing direct employment to an estimated 35 million people, and thereby contributing 4% of GDP and 35% of gross export earnings. The textile sector contributes to 14% of the manufacturing sector. From Spinning to garment manufacturing, entire textile production chain facilities are in Tamil Nadu. About half of India's total spinning mill capacity is in Tamil Nadu. The western part of Tamil Nadu comprising Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Dindigul and Karur has the majority of spinning mills manufacturing cotton/polyester/blended yarn, open end yarn and silk yarn used by garment units in Tamil Nadu, Maharastra etc. Yarn is also exported to China, Bangladesh etc. Tirupur city <b>knitted</b> <b>garment</b> units have been exporting garments for about 3 decades with 2015-16 exports in the range of USD 3 Billion. Erode and Karur are home textile (Curtain cloth, bed linens, kitchen linens, toilet linens, table linens, wall hangings etc.) manufacturing hubs. Madras (Chennai) has a large presence of woven garments (shirts/pants) manufacturing units. Madurai and Kanchipuram are famous for handloom sarees exported / sold all over India. LMW, one of the three major textile machinery manufacturing companies in the world is located in Coimbatore. Savio also has a factory in Coimbatore.
