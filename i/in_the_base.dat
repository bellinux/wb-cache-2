5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of an old cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 4: Nuka-World {{is set in}} the eponymous Nuka-World, a Nuka-Cola themed {{amusement}} park which was once a popular tourist destination run by the Nuka-Cola Corporation before the nuclear war. The park became a peaceful trading market, but by 2287 the Nuka-World ruins have been overrun by an alliance of raider gangs who use it as a personal fortress. Unlike the raiders featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> game, the raiders of Nuka-World are much more disciplined and organised, with each gang following a different ideology.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according {{to the effects of}} the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

It was released on November 10, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} storms to strike Vietnam since 1944, Typhoon Hester caused considerable damage in the country and disrupted the Vietnam War. Making landfall directly over the United States military installation in Chu Lai, Hester damaged or destroyed 75percent of the structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> Sustained winds and gusts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> were estimated to have reached 130km/h (80mph) and 160km/h (105mph) respectively. Four hangars collapsed in the Chu Lai airbase, with total aircraft losses amounting to 36 destroyed and 87 damaged. Losses from the destroyed helicopters exceeded $3.6million (1971USD). Dozens of barracks were damaged in Chu Lai and communications were hampered. The 91st Evacuation Hospital was mostly destroyed and was forced to transfer patients to Quy Nhơn. Nearly 50percent of the structures at the Marble Mountain Air Facility were damaged by the storm's high winds.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} not {{substantially}} reoccupied until Alfred the Great decided {{to rebuild the}} harbour as a defence against raiders. He built the town that later became Christchurch, {{on the north side}} of the harbour. Access to Salisbury up the River Avon made this a more strategic place. The Head may have been used for harbour defence at this time. In the 11th century, some of the iron-ore rich stones found at the Head were used in the construction of Christchurch Castle. These reddish-coloured stones can still be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the now ruined castle.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} impact from Typhoon Hester was felt in South Vietnam, where winds {{in excess of}} 155km/h (100mph) caused extensive damage to several United States Army bases.
