50|$|Tennis elbow (Lateral <b>Epicondylitis)</b> is {{a common}} elbow injury among climbers, as is Golfer's elbow (Medial <b>Epicondylitis,</b> which is similar, but occurs {{on the inside of}} the elbow).|$|E
50|$|A 2009 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} efficacy {{in the treatment of}} lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> concluded that these therapies may benefit people with lateral <b>epicondylitis,</b> but the evidence was limited. A 2010 review concluded moderate evidence exists to support the use of prolotherapy injections in the management of pain in lateral <b>epicondylitis,</b> and that prolotherapy was no more effective than eccentric exercise in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. A 2016 review found a trend towards benefit in 2016 for lateral <b>epicondylitis.</b> A 2017 review found tentative evidence in Achilles tendinopathy.|$|E

50|$|As of November 2013, {{researchers}} at the Seoul National University Hospital will be looking to recruit participants into a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ALLO-ASC) {{for the treatment of}} a lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> tendon injury where the duration of the symptoms is over six months. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be administrated to the patients with lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> (tennis elbow) by an ultrasonographic-guided injection.|$|E

50|$|At {{least one}} author {{questions}} that lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> {{is caused by}} repetitive microtrauma/overuse, maintaining the theory is likely overstated and lacks scientific support.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tennis elbow" [...] (formally lateral <b>epicondylitis)</b> {{does not}} {{necessarily}} result from playing tennis, nor {{as a result of}} any other repetitive strain injury.|$|E
50|$|Evidence for the {{treatment}} of lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> before 2010 was poor. There were clinical trials addressing many proposed treatments, but the trials were of poor quality.|$|E
50|$|Repetitive {{strain injury}} (RSI) and {{associative}} trauma orders are umbrella terms {{used to refer}} to several discrete conditions that can be associated with repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained/awkward positions. Examples of conditions that may sometimes be attributed to such causes include edema, tendinosis (or less often tendinitis), carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, De Quervain syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, intersection syndrome, golfer's elbow (medial <b>epicondylitis),</b> tennis elbow (lateral <b>epicondylitis),</b> trigger finger (so-called stenosing tenosynovitis), radial tunnel syndrome, and focal dystonia.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{techniques}} for lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> {{can be done}} by open surgery, percutaneous surgery or arthroscopic surgery, with no evidence that any particular type is better or worse than another.|$|E
50|$|Golfer's elbow, or medial <b>epicondylitis,</b> is tendinosis of {{the medial}} {{epicondyle}} {{on the inside}} of the elbow. It is in some ways similar to tennis elbow, which affects the outside at the lateral epicondyle.|$|E
50|$|Other {{speculative}} {{risk factors for}} lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> include taking up tennis later in life, unaccustomed strenuous activity, decreased mental chronometry and speed and repetitive eccentric contraction of muscle (controlled lengthening of a muscle group).|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} an A9 athletes's amputations can effect their {{physiology}} and sports performance. Common problems with intact upper limbs {{for people in}} this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, <b>epicondylitis</b> and peripheral nerve entrapment.|$|E
50|$|A study {{investigated}} autologous tenocyte injection {{for the treatment}} of severe, chronic resistant lateral <b>epicondylitis.</b> A needle biopsy was used on the patellar tendon, and the extracted tendon cells were expanded by in vitro culture. The autologous tenocytes were sorted and purified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and amplified by flow cytometry. The tenocytes were then injected into the injured tendinopathy site, which was the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon, under the guidance of an ultrasound. After the autologous tenocyte injection treatment, patients with chronic lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> showed improved clinical function and structural repair at the origin of the common extensor tendon.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> is degenerative. Non-inflammatory, chronic degenerative {{changes of}} the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle are identified in surgical pathology specimens. It is unclear if the pathology is affected by prior injection of corticosteroid.|$|E
50|$|Depending upon {{severity}} {{and quantity}} of multiple tendon injuries that have built up, the extensor carpi radialis brevis may not be fully healed by conservative treatment. Nirschl defines four stages of lateral <b>epicondylitis,</b> showing the introduction of permanent damage beginning at Stage 2.|$|E
50|$|Tennis elbow or lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> is a {{condition}} in which the outer part of the elbow becomes sore and tender at the lateral epicondyle. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from repetitive overuse. This leads to pain and tenderness {{on the outside of the}} elbow.|$|E
50|$|If {{patients}} mention {{reproduction of}} symptoms to the forearm during elbow flexion of 120-130 degrees with the forearm in maximal supination, then the lesion may be localized {{to the area}} underneath the lacertus fibrosus (also known as bicipital aponeurosis). This is sometimes misdiagnosed as elbow strain and medial or lateral <b>epicondylitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} an A9 athletes's amputations can effect their {{physiology}} and sports performance. Because they are missing a limb, amputees {{are more prone}} to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems with intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, <b>epicondylitis</b> and peripheral nerve entrapment.|$|E
50|$|For A5 and A7 {{competitors}} in this class, {{the nature of}} a person's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because they are missing a limb, amputees are more prone to overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems for intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, <b>epicondylitis</b> and peripheral nerve entrapment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epicondylitis</b> is {{much more}} common on the lateral side of the elbow (tennis elbow), rather than the medial side. In most cases, its onset is gradual and {{symptoms}} often persist for weeks before patients seek care. In golfer's elbow, pain at the medial epicondyle is aggravated by resisted wrist flexion and pronation, {{which is used to}} aid diagnosis. On the other hand, tennis elbow is indicated by the presence of lateral epicondylar pain precipitated by resisted wrist extension. Although the condition is poorly understood at a cellular and molecular level, there are hypotheses that point to apoptosis and autophagic cell death as causes of chronic lateral <b>epicondylitis.</b> The cell death may decrease the muscle density and cause a snowball effect in muscle weakness - this susceptibility can compromise a muscle's ability to maintain its integrity. So athletes, like pitchers, must work on preventing this cell death via flexibility training and other preventive measures.|$|E
50|$|Sorbothane {{has many}} {{industrial}} applications, from acoustic shielding to machine mounts. It {{has been used}} to quiet personal computers by being packed around the hard drive and other noisy spinning components. Sorbothane dampens vibration transmission from vibrating hardware. It {{has been used to}} isolate subwoofers from turntables. In addition, Sorbothane has been used by NASA to isolate vibration, in the Air Force Memorial, and to transport the Liberty Bell. It is currently used with insoles and heel pads to absorb impacts during sports activities such as football, cricket, and rugby, and it is an effective product to help alleviate the symptoms of plantar fasciitis and provide protection against lower limb injuries caused by repetitive motion during games. Because of its unique ability to dramatically diminish shock waves and maintain its shape under stress, Sorbothane has shown promise in the treatment of lateral <b>epicondylitis,</b> also known as tennis elbow, and medial <b>epicondylitis,</b> or golfer's elbow. It is also used in recoil pads of guns.|$|E
50|$|Tennis elbow or lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> is {{a chronic}} or an acute {{inflammation}} of the tendons that arise from the outer part of the elbow. The affected tendons are the tendons of extensor muscles which originate from the lateral epicondyle of humerus. It {{is caused by the}} repetitive movements and overuse. It damages the tendons which results in pain and tenderness on the outer part of the elbow.|$|E
5000|$|A common injury {{associated}} with the lateral epicondyle of the humerus is lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> also known as tennis elbow. Repetitive overuse of the forearm, as seen in tennis or other sports, can result in inflammation of [...] "the tendons that join the forearm muscles {{on the outside of}} the elbow. The forearm muscles and tendons become damaged from overuse. This leads to pain and tenderness {{on the outside of the}} elbow." ...|$|E
50|$|Nintendo thumb, {{also known}} as gamer's grip, Nintendonitis and similar names, is a video game-related health problem {{classified}} {{as a form of}} repetitive strain injury (RSI). The symptoms are the blistering, paraesthesia and swelling of the thumbs, mainly through use of the D-pad, though any finger can be affected. This can lead to stress on tendons, nerves and ligaments in the hands, and further onto lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> ("tennis elbow"), tendinitis, bursitis and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).|$|E
50|$|One of {{the groups}} of people {{competing}} in this class is people with upper limb amputations from ISOD A5, A6, A7 and A8 classes. The nature of a person's amputations in this class can effect their physiology and sports performance. Because they are missing a limb, amputees {{are more prone to}} overuse injuries in their remaining limbs. Common problems for intact upper limbs for people in this class include rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, <b>epicondylitis</b> and peripheral nerve entrapment.|$|E
50|$|The OssaTron is {{the first}} shock wave unit {{developed}} especially for orthopaedic applications. The OssaTron covers a range of orthopaedic indications suitable for Shock Wave Technology. It is marketed as the only Extracorporeal Shock Wave Technology (ESWT) system approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} multiple orthopaedic conditions. The OssaTron is currently FDA approved to treat chronic plantar fasciitis (heel pain) and chronic lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> (tennis elbow) when these conditions have failed to respond to conservative treatments.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, a {{systematic}} review studying various injection therapies found that prolotherapy and hyaluronic acid injection therapies were {{more effective than}} placebo when treating lateral <b>epicondylitis.</b> Of the studies evaluated, one of ten glucocorticoid trials, one of five trials for autologous blood injection or platelet-rich plasma, one trial of polidocanol, and one trial of prolotherapy met the criteria for low risk of bias. The authors noted that few of the reviewed trials met the criteria for low risk of bias.|$|E
50|$|ASOTRECOL {{alleges that}} its members {{incurred}} work-related injuries at the GM plant, and that GM illegally fired {{workers who were}} consequently unable to perform their work. ASTORECOL's 68 members suffer from various injuries associated with strenuous, repetitive motions, including: musculoskeletal problems, herniated discs, carpal tunnel, elbow and shoulder tendonitis, tinnitus (chronic ringing in the ears), elbow <b>epicondylitis,</b> knee problems, cancer, and spinal injuries. Many have undergone multiple surgeries. GM Colmotores denies all claims, asserting that its number one priority is {{the health and well-being}} of its workers.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} an A9 athletes's amputations can effect their {{physiology}} and sports performance. Because {{of the potential}} for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than 15 lb. Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. They are also more prone to injuries including rotator cuffs tearing, shoulder impingement, <b>epicondylitis</b> and peripheral nerve entrapment.|$|E
