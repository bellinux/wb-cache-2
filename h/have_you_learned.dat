6000|$|The {{first use}} is this, {{to make a}} strict inquiry whether you be born of God or not. Examine by those things I laid down before of a child of nature and a child of grace.

[...] All God's {{children}} are criers. Can you be quiet without you have a bellyful of the milk of God's word? Can you be satisfied without you have peace with God? Pray you consider it, and be serious with yourselves. If you have not these marks, you will fall short of the kingdom of God, you shall never have an interest there; there is no intruding. They will say, [...] "Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will say, I know you not." [...] No child of God, no heavenly inheritance. We sometimes give something to those that are not our children, but not our lands. O do not flatter yourselves with a portion among the sons, unless you live like sons. When we see a king's son play with a beggar, this is unbecoming; so if you be the king's children, live like the king's children. If you be risen with Christ, set your affections on things above, and not on things below. When you come together, talk of what your Father promised you; you should all love your Father's will, and be content and pleased with the exercises you meet with in the world. If you are the children of God, live together lovingly. If the world quarrel with you, it is no matter; but it is sad if you quarrel together. If this be amongst you, it is a sign of ill-breeding, it is not according to rules you have in the Word of God. Dost thou see a soul that has the image of God in him? Love him, love him; say, This man and I must go to heaven one day. Serve one another, do good for one another; and if any wrong you, pray to God to right you, and love the brotherhood.|$|E

6000|$|Most {{people with}} whom I talk, men and women even of some {{originality}} and genius, have their scheme of the universe all cut and dried,--very dry, I assure you, to hear, dry enough to burn, dry-rotted and powder-post, methinks,--which they set up between you and them in the shortest intercourse; an ancient and tottering frame with all its boards blown off. They do not walk without their bed. Some, to me, seemingly very unimportant and unsubstantial things and relations, are for them everlastingly settled,--as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the like. These are like the everlasting hills to them. But in all my wanderings I never came across the least vestige of authority for these things. They have not left so distinct a trace as the delicate flower of a remote geological period on the coal in my grate. The wisest man preaches no doctrines; he has no scheme; he sees no rafter, not even a cobweb, against the heavens. It is clear sky. If I ever see more clearly at one time than at another, the medium through which I see is clearer. To see from earth to heaven, and see there standing, still a fixture, that old Jewish scheme! What right have you to hold up this obstacle to my understanding you, to your understanding me! You did not invent it; it was imposed on you. Examine your authority. Even Christ, we fear, had his scheme, his conformity to tradition, which slightly vitiates his teaching. He had not swallowed all formulas. He preached some mere doctrines. As for me, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are now only the subtilest imaginable essences, which would not stain the morning sky. Your scheme must be {{the framework of the}} universe; all other schemes will soon be ruins. The perfect God in his revelations of himself has never got to the length of one such proposition as you, his prophets, state. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> the alphabet of heaven and can count three? Do you know the number of God's family? Can you put mysteries into words? Do you presume to fable of the ineffable? Pray, what geographer are you, that speak of heaven's topography? Whose friend are you that speak of God's personality? Do you, Miles Howard, think that he has made you his confidant? Tell me of the height of the mountains of the moon, or of the diameter of space, and I may believe you, but of the secret history of the Almighty, and I shall pronounce thee mad. Yet we have a sort of family history of our God,--so have the Tahitians of theirs,--and some old poet's grand imagination is imposed on us as adamantine everlasting truth, and God's own word! Pythagoras says, truly enough, [...] "A true assertion respecting God, is an assertion of God"; but we may well doubt if there is any example of this in literature.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} day the King had everything put into the castle; and when night drew on the youth took up his position there, lit a bright fire {{in one of the}} rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife close to it, and sat himself down on the turning lathe. [...] "Oh! if I could only shudder!" [...] he said: [...] "but I sha'n't learn it here either." [...] Toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard a shriek from a corner. [...] "Ou, miou! how cold we are!" [...] "You fools!" [...] he cried; [...] "why do you scream? If you are cold, come and sit at the fire and warm yourselves." [...] And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: [...] "Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?" [...] "Why not?" [...] he replied; [...] "but first let me see your paws." [...] Then they stretched out their claws. [...] "Ha!" [...] said he; [...] "what long nails you've got! Wait a minute: I must first cut them off." [...] Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws firmly. [...] "After watching you narrowly," [...] said he, [...] "I no longer feel any desire to play cards with you"; and with these words he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of them to their final rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire, out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he couldn't possibly get away from them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire, scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on quietly for a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and called out: [...] "Be off, you rabble rout!" [...] and let fly at them. Some of them fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more, and warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. [...] "The very thing," [...] he said, and laid himself down in it. But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle. [...] "Capital," [...] he said, [...] "only a little quicker." [...] Then the bed sped on as if drawn by six horses, over thresholds and stairs, up this way and down that. All of a sudden--crash, crash! with a bound it turned over, upside down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him. But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: [...] "Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive," [...] lay down at his fire, and slept till daylight. In the morning the King came, and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: [...] "What a pity! and such a fine fellow he was." [...] The youth heard this, got up, and said: [...] "It's not come to that yet." [...] Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and asked how it had fared with him. [...] "First-rate," [...] he answered; [...] "and now I've survived the one night, I shall get through the other two also." [...] The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide, and said: [...] "Well, I never thought to see you alive again. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> now what shuddering is?" [...] "No," [...] he replied, [...] "it's quite hopeless; if someone could only tell me how to!" ...|$|E

But where <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> that, seeing that I have {{inherited}} twenty million sesterces?[207] I am happier in this than you. No one but a friend has made me his heir. Lucius Rubrius Cassinas, whom you never even saw, has named you." [...] He here refers to a man over whose property Antony {{was supposed to have}} obtained control fraudulently. [...] "Did he know of you whether you were a white man or a negro? * * * Would you mind telling me what height Turselius stood?" [...] Here he names another of whose property Antony is supposed to have obtained possession illegally. [...] "I believe all you know of him is what farms he had. * * * Do you bear in mind," [...] he says, [...] "that you were a bankrupt as soon as you had become a man? Do you remember your early friendship with Curio, and the injuries you did his father?" [...] Here it is impossible to translate literally, but after speaking as he had done very openly, he goes on: [...] "But I must omit the iniquities of your private life. There are things I cannot repeat here. You are safe, because the deeds you have done are too bad to be mentioned. But let us look at the affairs of your public life. I will just go through them;" [...] which he does, laying bare as he well knew how to do, every past act. [...] "When you had been made Quæstor you flew at once to Cæsar. You knew that he was the only refuge for poverty, debt, wickedness, and vice. Then, when you had gorged upon his generosity and your plunderings--which indeed you spent faster than you got it--you betook yourself instantly to the Tribunate. * * * It is you, Antony, you who supplied Cæsar with an excuse for invading his country." [...] Cæsar had declared at the Rubicon that the Tribunate had been violated in the person of Antony. [...] "I will say nothing here against Cæsar, though nothing can excuse a man for taking up arms against his country. But of you it has to be confessed that you were the cause. * * * He has been a very Helen to us Trojans. * * * He has brought back many a wretched exile, but has forgotten altogether his own uncle"--Cicero's colleague in the Consulship, who had been banished for plundering his province. [...] "We have seen this Tribune of the people carried through the town on a British war-chariot. His lictors with their laurels went before him. In the midst, on an open litter, was carried an actress. When you come back from Thessaly with your legions to Brundisium you did not kill me! Oh, what a kindness! * * * You with those jaws of yours, with that huge chest, with that body like a gladiator, drank so much wine at Hippea's marriage that in the sight of all Rome you were forced to vomit.* * * When he had seized Pompey's property he rejoiced like some stage-actor who in a play is as poor as Poverty, and then suddenly becomes rich. All his wine, the great weight of silver, the costly furniture and rich dresses, in a few days where were they all? A Charybdis do I call him? He swallowed them all like an entire ocean!" [...] Then he accuses him of cowardice and cruelty in the Pharsalian wars, and compares him most injuriously with Dolabella. [...] "Do you remember how Dolabella fought for you in Spain, when you were getting drunk at Narbo? And how did you get back from Narbo? He has asked as to my return to the city. I have explained to you, O conscript fathers, how I had intended to be here in January, so as to be of some service to the Republic. You inquire how I got back. In daylight--not in the dark, as you did; with Roman shoes on and a Roman toga--not in barbaric boots and an old cloak.* * * When Cæsar returned from Spain you again pushed yourself into his intimacy--not a brave man, we should say, but still strong enough for his purposes. Cæsar did always this--that if there were a man ruined, steeped in debt, up to his ears in poverty--a base, needy, bold man--that was the man whom he could receive into his friendship." [...] This as to Cæsar was undoubtedly true. [...] "Recommended in this way, you were told to declare yourself Consul." [...] Then he describes the way in which he endeavored to prevent the nomination of Dolabella to the same office. Cæsar had said that Dolabella should be Consul, but when Cæsar was dead this did not suit Antony. When the tribes had been called in their centuries to vote, Antony, not understanding what form of words he ought to have used as augur to stop the ceremony, had blundered. [...] "Would you not call him a very Lælius?" [...] says Cicero. Lælius had made for himself a name among augurs for excellence.|$|E
