The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service.

25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} {{on tax cuts}} rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and <b>investment,</b> <b>tax</b> cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E
