5|$|Kyle {{agrees to}} take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals {{that he intends}} to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham, and then steals Batman's {{technology}} from Wayne Enterprises armorer Lucius Fox. Bane fights Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who {{was born and raised in}} the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1839, on the {{occasion}} of the laying of the cornerstone of Kawaiahaʻo Church, Kapeau personally played part in the ceremony. He made a copper plate, the first engraving <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> by a Hawaiian, which was placed under the stone as a memorial to the Christian mission in Hawaii along with a copy of the newly translated Hawaiian Bible and two volumes on Mathematics and Anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof the card had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of the card taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that the card in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> on the card.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe {{has also}} {{done well in}} the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games in {{swimming}} with Kirsty Coventry obtaining 11 gold medals in the different competitions. Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis, most notably with the Black family, which comprises Wayne Black, Byron Black and Cara Black. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in the 24-year history of the ranking.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44tries, twelve {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did {{they have a new}} head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders' 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three weeks {{from the end of the}} round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E

5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E
5|$|The Highlander’s 2005 season {{started with}} only their second ever {{loss to the}} Blues at Carisbrook, a 3014 loss. Following this the side won six games consecutively, {{the first time the}} {{franchise}} had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so. They first defeated the Bulls 230, then the Sharks 437. They then won away against the Cats and Reds. They returned to Carisbrook and defeated the Brumbies 1918, and the following week won in Wellington {{for the first time with}} a 2616 win over the Hurricanes. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Thus three weeks from the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E
5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> this.|$|E

5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after showing signs of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
