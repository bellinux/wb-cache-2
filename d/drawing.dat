5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private <b>Drawing</b> Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the <b>Drawing</b> Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless <b>drawing</b> rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the <b>Drawing</b> Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E

5|$|The Dillon <b>Drawing</b> Room, {{which was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Lee <b>Drawing</b> Room, was renamed in honor of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C.

The wallpaper was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. The Dillon <b>Drawing</b> Room is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|E

25|$|Tethered plug <b>drawing,</b> {{also known}} as {{semi-floating}} mandrel <b>drawing,</b> is a mix between floating plug <b>drawing</b> and fixed plug <b>drawing.</b> The mandrel is allowed to float, but it still anchored via a tether. This process gives similar results to the floating plug process, except that it is designed for straight tubes. It gives a better inner surface finish than rod <b>drawing.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Drawing</b> {{differs from}} rolling {{in that the}} {{pressure}} of <b>drawing</b> is not transmitted through the turning action of the mill but instead depends on force applied locally near the area of compression. This means the amount of possible <b>drawing</b> force {{is limited by the}} tensile strength of the material, a fact that is particularly evident when <b>drawing</b> thin wires.|$|E

50|$|An inside {{straight}} <b>draw,</b> or gutshot <b>draw</b> or belly buster <b>draw,</b> is a {{hand with}} {{four of the}} five cards needed for a straight, but missing one in the middle. For example, 9-x-7-6-5. An inside straight <b>draw</b> has four outs (four cards to fill the missing internal rank). Because straight <b>draws</b> including an ace only have four outs, they are also considered inside straight <b>draws.</b> For example, A-K-Q-J-x or A-2-3-4-x. The probability of catching an out for an inside straight <b>draw</b> is half that of catching an out for an outside straight <b>draw.</b>|$|R
