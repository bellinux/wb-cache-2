2500|$|Empire of Dreams {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, earning an 83.10% and an 85 out of 100 average ratings from aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Upon its release in Japan, Weekly Famitsu scored the game a 34 out of 40, earning the magazine's Gold Award. GameSpot called the title [...] "a highly respectable emulation {{of the general}} feel of the Klonoa universe," [...] but overall found it [...] "less ambitious" [...] than [...] on the PlayStation 2. They would also praise the game's audio and visual presentation, including its multiplaned backgrounds, <b>image</b> <b>scaling,</b> and rotation effects, declaring that [...] "Despite a minimal level of background animation, the game looks awesome." [...] IGN similarly applauded the game's graphic capabilities, but found the color palette a bit lacking {{when compared to other}} titles on the system. The website additionally favored its overall gameplay and puzzles, ultimately calling the game [...] "absolutely wonderful" [...] and [...] "one of the most cleverly-designed platform games on the Game Boy Advance." [...] During their [...] "Best of 2001" [...] awards, IGN would name Empire of Dreams [...] "Best Platformer" [...] for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E

40|$|The Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope (SST) offers {{excellent}} imaging quality, {{but it has}} {{a comparatively}} small field of view. This means that while observing the solar photosphere, there has been no convenient way of calibrating the <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> of the telescope. Other telescopes, such as NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) utilize their larger Field of View (FOV) to use the solar disk as a reference in order to measure the <b>image</b> <b>scale.</b> In the past, the <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> of the SST has been determined by measuring the distance between the moons of Jupiter in a captured SST image and comparing it to reference values, {{as well as with the}} Venus transit of 2004. Both of these methods have their drawbacks, including needing to open the telescope at night or waiting for the very rare occurrence of a solar transit, which the telescope may not even be in a position to observe. Additionally, assessing the accuracy of these methods can be difficult. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the feasibility of an idea proposed by the faculty of the Institute for Solar Physics at Stockholm University, that would allow us to routinely calibrate the <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> of the SST when desired and with known accuracy of the measurement, without the need to open the telescope at night. The measurements performed so far are consistent with the old value to about one third of a percent, with a total uncertainty of the SST/CRISP <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> of about 0. 1 percent. Resulting in a grid spacing of the pinhole array of 5. 15 arcseconds, which can be used to determine the <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> of all the remaining science cameras of the SST.

In the current study, we examine predictors of sending unsolicited explicit images, a particularly underexplored online sexual behavior. The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of dark personality traits (i. e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and self-rated mate value in predicting attitudes toward and behavior of sending unsolicited explicit images. Two hundred and forty participants (72 % female; Mage = 25. 96, SD = 9. 79) completed an online questionnaire which included a measure of self-rated mate value, a measure of dark personality traits, and questions regarding sending unsolicited explicit images (operationalized as the explicit <b>image</b> <b>scale).</b> Men, compared to women, were found to have higher explicit <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> scores, and both self-rated mate value and trait Machiavellianism were positive predictors of explicit <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> scores. Interestingly, there were no significant interactions between sex and these variables. Further, Machiavellianism mediated all relationships between other dark traits and explicit <b>image</b> <b>scale</b> scores, indicating this behavior is best explained by the personality trait associated with behavioral strategies. In sum, these results provide support for the premise that sending unsolicited explicit images may be a tactic of a short-term mating strategy; however, future research should further explore this claim...|$|R
