50|$|In December 2011, the European Council {{stressed}} that the Digital Single Market was an area of growth potential for the European Union. Vice-President Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, then asked the European Commission to take up this challenge by appointing a national Digital Champion, who could help get every European digital.On 14 February 2012 the European Commission President José Manuel Barroso wrote to Member States {{and asked them to}} take further dedicated action to make the Digital Single Market a reality. One way to do this was to appoint a national Digital Champion.The first meeting of the Digital Champions and Vice-President Kroes was held in Brussels in June 2012. Further meetings were held in Sofia in September 2012 and in Brussels 2013. The Digital Champions convened for the fourth time in Dublin back-to-back with the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>Assembly.</b> The Champions fifth and sixth meetings were held in Brussels and their seventh meeting back-to-back to the Digital Action Day on 29 September 2014. The Digital Champions met with European Vice-President Andrus Ansip and European Commissioner Günther Oettinger in February 2015. Their ninth meeting took place back-to-back with the Digital Assembly in Riga in June 2015 and since then they met several times either in Brussels or at subsequent Digital Assemblies.|$|E
40|$|The {{first phase}} of the SEA-SoNS ("Assessing the Benefits of Social Networks on Organizations”) project aimed to analyse the current market {{situation}} for a limited number of social media stakeholders, to identify and analyse best practices for these selected stakeholders, and to define and prioritise relevant policy options. It was observed that while social media technologies present several potential benefits to organisations, there are considerable challenges and bottlenecks affecting adoption that may warrant policy intervention. To accomplish the objective of developing suitable policy options, the project undertook a range of research and data collection activities, including: •	An exhaustive and critical review of the academic, business and policy literature on the organisational use of social networking tools and social media platforms, as well as regular engagement with academic experts in this area •	A scoping workshop hosted in Brussels in March 2012, at which the IPTS engaged various stakeholders and social media experts to identify and prioritise the major opportunities and challenges for organizational adoption and deployment of social networking and social media platforms •	Ten semi-structured interviews with both technology providers (supply side) and organisational adopters (demand side), to understand and assess their perspectives on the organisational benefits of social technologies, the attendant challenges, best practices, and the wider policy environment •	An online 'animation' of stakeholders whereby a larger number of users and experts (n= 50) were able to reflect on the main benefits and bottlenecks as regards business and public administration use of social technologies, and to feed these insights into our parallel research activities •	A brainstorming workshop in early June 2012, held in Seville, the main objective of which was to distil and synthesise the most important benefits, challenges, best practices, and policy options that emerged from the literature review, stakeholder interviews, and online stakeholder animation •	A presentation at the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> <b>Assembly</b> (DAA) 2012 that summarised our research to date and focused mainly on policy options for Europe in the area of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) adoption of social media technologies – and, in particular, how these technologies can help to facilitate economic growth and job creationJRC.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act were primarily to facilitate the efficient operation of copyright industries online and to promote certainty for the communications and information technology industries. It is submitted that the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act failed on both these grounds. In fact it has resulted in an overly-bureaucratic regime that places onerous burdens on intermediaries between the owners and users of copyrighted works. Jessica Litman anticipates that the public will continue to ignore and resist the legal regulation of their online practices: People don't obey laws they don't believe in. Goverments {{find it difficult to}} enforce laws that {{only a handful of people}} obey. Laws that people don't obey and that governments don't enforce are not much use to interests that persuaded Congress to enact them. If a law is bad enough, even its proponents might be willing to abandon it in favor of a different law that seems more legitimate to the people it is intended to command. The glut of copyright lawsuits coupled with a submissive judiciary will only encourage more civil disobedience. Burdensome prescriptions and draconian penalties will harm the legitimacy of copyright law, and will foster non-compliance amongst large numbers of the population. - There should be an open policy debate about the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act. It ought not merely be a matter of technical review of the amendments of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act; it must necessarily involve re-examining the political compromises that were made during the passage of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act-in terms of the Discussion Paper, the Andrews Committee report, and the final legislation. - The Philips Fox review takes a very fragmented approach to the <b>digital</b> <b>agenda</b> - breaking the topic into four Issues Papers. As a result, there are some important omissions and lacunae from the <b>digital</b> <b>agenda</b> review process - most notably, the lack of discussion about the right of communication to the public, the application of the defence of fair dealing to the digital environment, and the relationship between copyright law and contract. The issues discussed under the heading of Issue 22 are diverse and deserving of much closer individual scrutiny. Grouping together peer-to-peer file-sharing software, CD burning and personal video recorders demonstrates the lack of an attempt to deal with the substantive issues raised by each of these technologies. These technologies have each been the subject of much contention and ought to be carefully scrutinised. 	The economic perspective adopted by the <b>digital</b> <b>agenda</b> review is both narrow and simplistic. Richard Posner is an unconvincing commentator on copyright work. His last work suggested that copyright law should be transformed into a registration system, along the lines of trade mark law and patent law. Such an argument misses many of the niceties of copyright law doctrine. There is a need for an awareness of the limitations on relying on a crude law and economics model. There is a need to adopt a wide range of economic, legal, technological, political, social, and cultural perspectives in an analysis on the <b>digital</b> <b>agenda</b> review. - The relationship between the Philips Fox review and the oversight by the Government seems unclear. The review states: "If there are issues raised by the amendments made to the Act by the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act that are of concern to you but which are not included in the terms of reference, you may make a separate submission on that issue, or those issues, to the Attorney-General’s Department. " The role of the Attorney-General's Government remains unclear. It is also of concern that the Copyright Law Review Committee is not participating in the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review - when one would think that such a topic falls squarely within its mandate. - There is the potential for conflict between the parallel processes of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review and the free trade agreement. A recent editorial in the Australian Financial Review observed: - The federal government's review of copyright laws is a puzzling exercise. Stakeholders know the real copyright law review is taking place behind closed doors in the free-trade agreement talks with the United States. US negotiators want Australia to toughen its laws to suit US intellectual property giants. Yet stakeholders taking part in the official review are being told the potential impact of the FTA is not on the agenda. - There is a danger that the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review may be made redundant because of the reforms brought about by the free trade agreement. It will be noted that two of the stated aims of the United States in these negotiations are: firstly, to ‘seek to enhance the level of Australia's protection for intellectual property rights beyond TRIPS in new areas of technology, such as internet service provider liability’; and secondly to ‘seek to strengthen Australia's domestic enforcement procedures, such as increasing criminal penalties so that they are sufficient to have a deterrent effect on piracy and counterfeiting’. LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendation 1 It is recommended that the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review adopt an integrated approach to dealing with the issues raised. In particular, it needs to address the right of communication to the public, the application of the defence of fair dealing to the digital environment, and the relationship between copyright law and contract. Recommendation 2 It is recommended that the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review employ a mix of methodologies to investigate the impact of the legislation - rather than necessarily be limited to the approach of the Chicago school of law and economics. Recommendation 3 It is recommended that the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Review be co-ordinated with a number of other policy initiatives - including those of the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Intellectual Property and Competition Review, and the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Recommendation 4 The definition of libraries should remain open-ended. Recommendation 5 Users should be able to make a fair dealing hard copy of a work made available on-line on the premises of a library or archives. Recommendation 6 There are no current adverse effects on owners’ markets as a result of libraries’ electronic copying rights. Recommendation 7 The <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act impedes libraries and archives from discharging their functions as disseminators of information in digital form. Recommendation 8 The provisions dealing with the so-called right of first-digitisation should be removed from the <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act. Recommendation 9 Broader-exceptions should be introduced for libraries and archives in respect of non-literary works. Recommendation 10 The <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act should be revised to clarify the scope of a work and other subject matter in the digital and on-line environment. Recommendation 11 There is no policy reason to exclude artistic works from the educational copying exception in s 135 ZMB. Recommendation 12 The <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act should adopt a broad definition of the word "hardcopy". Recommendation 13 The <b>Digital</b> <b>Agenda</b> Act is inhibiting the ability of educational institutions to make the most of the benefits of new communications technologies for the purposes of instruction and learning. Recommendation 14 There are no adverse effects on owners’ markets due to the ability of educational institutions to copy non-contiguous excerpts than nonetheless comprise less than 1...|$|R

These regulations are then tested for their influence on the European single market. The major question answered here is whether the EU regulations in field of ICT have a positive impact on the EUs single market. Answer to this question helps us evaluate the ongoing <b>Digital</b> <b>agenda</b> strategy. The impact of the regulations is analysed by induction of the following indicators, international trade, ratio of population buying online, DESI index and NRI index. With this method it is possible to tackle the wide range of fields the <b>Digital</b> <b>agenda</b> covers. I conclude this work with the statement, that European ICT regulations do have a positive impact on the single market, although are problematic due to the slow legislative process and low efficiency in addressing the regulated issue...|$|R
