5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays {{a critical role in}} the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E
5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months and sped up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at <b>Glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

It can form clouds, can turn into water, can change color as an ability to blend in with their surroundings, as an effective form of camouflage or <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark (according to the Shuowen Jiezi).|$|E
25|$|Nomen are black-coated shaggy {{creatures that}} lumber {{on all fours}} in {{preference}} to an upright gait. They are crafty nocturnal hunters who prefer small packs to seeking prey alone. Their hands are clawed, and their eyes are red and seemingly <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. Nomen will drop on unwary travelers from a forest canopy rather than attempt a direct confrontation. They use basic weapons, favoring the spear most of all. Nomen {{can be found in}} the Dunwood and are said to inhabit the Hest Mountains beyond Inkarra in great numbers. In the distant past, they came north and invaded, but were slaughtered and their numbers greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s {{the use of}} radium {{paint was}} discontinued. In many cases {{luminous}} dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or tritium (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used today. These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium. Tritium emits very low-energy beta radiation (even lower-energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium) which cannot penetrate the skin, rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer.|$|E

50|$|The {{commercial}} {{began with}} a scene of a swamp at nighttime, and a close-up of Bud rhythmically croaking his name. Later Weis and Er join in. They croak rather randomly for about ten seconds, until Bud, Weis, and Er begin croaking in sequence, thus forming the Budweiser name. Their croaking becomes quicker as the camera pulls back to show a bar with a large neon Budweiser sign <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. The commercial is often listed among the best Super Bowl advertisements in history, ranking at #5 at MSNBC's list in 2004.|$|R

The narrator helps Roderick put the body in the tomb, and he notes that Madeline has rosy cheeks, as some do after death. They inter her, but over the next week both Roderick and the narrator find themselves becoming increasingly agitated for no apparent reason. A storm begins. Roderick comes to the narrator's bedroom, which is situated directly above the vault, and throws open his window to the storm. He notices that the tarn surrounding the house seems to <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, as it glowed in Roderick Usher's paintings, although there is no lightning.|$|E
25|$|Each cathode {{can be made}} to <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{characteristic}} neon red-orange color {{by applying}} about 170 volts DC at a few milliamperes between a cathode and the anode. The current limiting is normally implemented as an anode resistor of a few tens of thousands of ohms. Nixies exhibit negative resistance and will maintain their glow at typically 20 V to 30 V below the strike voltage. Some color variation can be observed between types, caused by differences in the gas mixtures used. Longer-life tubes that were manufactured later in the Nixie timeline have mercury added to reduce sputtering resulting in a blue or purple tinge to the emitted light. In some cases, these colors are filtered out by a red or orange filter coating on the glass.|$|E

5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting <b>the</b> atmosphere, though <b>in</b> this case <b>the</b> charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (<b>the</b> red <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (<b>the</b> green <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same image) have also been observed.|$|R

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|R
50|$|A {{historically}} important {{instance of}} triboluminescence occurred in Paris in 1675. Astronomer Jean-Felix Picard observed that his barometer was <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark as he carried it. His barometer {{consisted of a}} glass tube that was partially filled with mercury. Whenever the mercury slid down the glass tube, the empty space above the mercury would glow. While investigating this phenomenon, researchers discovered that static electricity could cause low-pressure air to glow. This discovery revealed the possibility of electric lighting.|$|R
