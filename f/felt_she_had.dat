Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E

The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009.

25|$|In this novel, Glasgow <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{successfully}} {{reversed the}} traditional seduction plot by producing a heroine completely {{freed from the}} southern patriarchal influence. She believed that writing Barren Ground, a “tragedy,” also freed her for her comedies of manners The Romantic Comedians (1926), They Stooped to Folly (1929), and The Sheltered Life (1932). These late works are considered the most artful criticism of romantic illusion in her career.|$|E

25|$|Helene came {{perilously close}} to being fired due to her failure to make any sales, along with suspicions by Sir Alan and his {{advisers}} (particularly Margaret) that she had consciously {{decided to take a}} backseat due to her having the least sales experience of the three members of Renaissance, but was saved by the fact that Sir Alan <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been one of the strongest candidates prior to her three-week losing run, and decided to give her a chance in the interviews. The You're Fired panel, while agreeing with Michael's dismissal, felt that firing Helene would have also been justifiable.|$|E
25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her.

25|$|Complicating the {{equation}} for Democrats, presidential candidate John McCain clinched the Republican nomination on March 4.

Some Democrats expressed concern that Clinton stayed in the campaign through March and April, when they <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> little {{chance to win the}} nomination, but a much greater chance to damage Obama's candidacy in the general election. However, others defended Clinton's right to continue on, arguing that a sustained campaign was good for the Democratic Party and that Clinton still had a realistic shot at the nomination.|$|E

25|$|Chloe Lane {{returns to}} Salem. She had {{previously}} {{given birth to}} a son, whom she had named Parker Jonas. The supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip Kiriakis was Parker's father, leading {{to the end of the}} marriage between Chloe and Daniel. Having lost him, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, Chloe attempts to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, revealing to Daniel that Parker really is his son and that the earlier supposed DNA test results had been fake. Hoping she could get Daniel back, Chloe blackmails Jennifer into rejecting Daniel by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker. Chloe goes so far as to have her mother Nancy prepare to take Parker to Brazil without telling Daniel, so Jennifer <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital to protect Daniel from losing access to his son while never revealing her true feelings.|$|E
25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E
25|$|By her own account, Casco {{began working}} with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she {{had the support of}} her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real {{political}} power, she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been less marginalized than others. Initially, women helped each other with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor pay, discrimination, poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that {{might be able to help}} them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions.|$|E
