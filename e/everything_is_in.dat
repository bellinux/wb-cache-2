5|$|The Stoic view of fate {{is entirely}} {{based on a}} view of the {{universe}} as a whole. Individual things and persons only come into consideration as dependent parts of this whole. <b>Everything</b> <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> every respect, determined by this relation, and is consequently subject to the general order of the world.|$|E
25|$|Analogy's {{purpose in}} Futurist writing {{was to show}} that {{everything}} related to one another. They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence. That is to say, despite what the experience might show one, <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> fact interconnected. The more startling the comparison, the more successful it is.|$|E
25|$|Soon, {{he announces}} that two {{strapping}} rams {{will carry the}} family's furniture in carts; the Pedal Express will be involved as well. When the day comes, Bramble, Mistletoe, Poppy and the Bellflowers' neighbours help out on the goods, while Zinnia and the other children wait for them at The Berries. By afternoon, <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> place, but the bunnies find out that Periwinkle is nowhere in sight. Instead, the lonely child {{has set up a}} small canvas tent near the old home, close to a hazelnut grove.|$|E

25|$|The {{action is}} {{confined}} to a derelict street corner where <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> ruins. The day is wintry, grey and sunless. A blind beggar (A), sitting on a folding-stool, is scraping away on his fiddle {{in the hope of}} getting a few coins from any passers-by. Three times in his opening speech he emphasises that he is “a poor old man.” His bowl is quite empty though; it has been some time since he has had contact with anyone. This day however a wheelchair-using man (B) is drawn to his playing. He is similarly disabled having lost one leg (“It went bad and was removed”).|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} dive {{planning}} {{is to ensure}} that divers do not exceed their comfort zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, and includes scuba gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddy do equipment checks to ensure <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> good working order and available. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training, when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility {{for the safety of the}} team lies with the supervisor.|$|E
500|$|When Spoletta brings {{news that}} Angelotti has killed himself, and that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> place for Cavaradossi's execution, Tosca, in despair, agrees {{to submit to}} Scarpia in return for Cavaradossi's freedom. Scarpia tells his deputy Spoletta to arrange a mock execution, both recalling {{that it will be}} [...] "as we did with Count Palmieri".|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{comparisons}} between {{the game and the}} Austin Powers film series, Hubbard pointed out on several occasions that, unlike Austin Powers, No One Lives Forever is not a parody of the spy genre. Contrasting the source of the humor in the two series, Hubbard noted that while the game is [...] "campy and silly, [...] the underlying premise borders on apocalyptic. That dichotomy in tone results in a very different style of humor from a parody, where <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> good fun and nobody, including the characters, takes anything very seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{fifty years}} Carter has devised {{a way to}} reverse time within a {{localized}} field, however the Odysseys power source (ZPM) is almost completely depleted from maintaining the time dilation field for fifty years. [...] Mitchell however hypothesizes {{that the power of}} the Ori energy beam could provide the required energy to reverse the time. This, however, will mean the loss of any memories of the last fifty years; additionally, whoever volunteers will remain at their advanced age. Teal'c, who as a Jaffa has a much longer lifespan than the other team members, volunteers to remain behind and perform the rescue, protected within a separate field. As the group prepares their plan, Vala and Daniel exchange a last embrace, assuring each other of their love. When <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> place, they deactivate the time dilation field and, after the normal timeline is restored, Teal'c prevents Colonel Carter from activating the time dilation field. Odyssey leaves before it is destroyed, saving SG-1 and the Asgard's legacy.|$|E
500|$|The 167 Bikini islanders {{first learned}} their fate four days later, on Sunday, February 10, when Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, United States {{military}} {{governor of the}} Marshall Islands, arrived by seaplane from Kwajalein. Referring to Biblical stories which they had learned from Protestant missionaries, he compared them to [...] "the children of Israel whom the Lord saved from their enemy and led into the Promised Land." [...] He also claimed it was [...] "for the good of mankind and to end all world wars." [...] There was no signed agreement, but he reported by cable [...] "their local chieftain, referred to as King Juda, arose {{and said that the}} natives of Bikini were very proud {{to be part of this}} wonderful undertaking." [...] On March 6, Wyatt attempted to stage a filmed reenactment of the February 10 meeting in which the Bikinians had given away their atoll. Despite repeated promptings and at least seven retakes, Juda confined his on-camera remarks to, [...] "We are willing to go. <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> God's hands." [...] The next day, LST-861 moved them and their belongings [...] east to the uninhabited Rongerik Atoll, to begin a permanent exile. Three Bikini families returned in 1974 but were evacuated again in 1978 because of radioactivity in their bodies from four years of eating contaminated food. As of 2015, the atoll remains unpopulated.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Magriel was a {{key witness}} for the defence, contradicting Dr. Roger Nelson, the expert {{prosecution}} witness, by saying, [...] "Game theory, however, really applies to games with imperfect knowledge, where something is concealed, such as poker. Backgammon {{is not such a}} game. <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> front of you. The person who uses that information in the most effective manner will win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Novalis' whole {{works are}} based upon an idea of education: [...] "We are on a mission: we {{are called upon to}} educate the earth." [...] It has to be made clear that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a continual process. It is the same with humanity, which forever strives towards and tries to {{recreate}} a new Golden Age – a paradisaic Age of harmony between man and nature that was assumed to have existed in earlier times. This Age was described by Plato, Plotinus and Franz Hemsterhuis, the last of whom was an extremely important figure for the German Romantics.|$|E

2500|$|Bikini was {{distant from}} both regular sea and air traffic, {{making it an}} ideal location. In February 1946, Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, the {{military}} governor [...] of the Marshall Islands, asked the 167 Micronesian inhabitants of the atoll to voluntarily and temporarily relocate so the United States government could begin testing atomic bombs for [...] "the good of mankind and to end all world wars." [...] After [...] "confused and sorrowful deliberation" [...] among the Bikinians, their leader, King Juda, agreed to the U.S. relocation request, announcing [...] "We will go believing that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the hands of God." [...] Nine of the eleven family heads, or alaps, chose Rongerik as their new home.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{declaration}} that the slaves within the Confederacy are freed ("Born to be Free" [...] (reprise)), <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> scarce supply during 1864. [...] Scarlett says that everyone must work the fields. [...] She shoots and kills a Yankee thief at Tara before ransacking his belongings with Melly ("Desperate Times"). [...] In 1865 the War is over, and Ashley {{makes his way}} home. [...] With Reconstruction after the War, the taxes on Tara have increased. [...] Ashley tells Scarlett the world has passed him by, and only Rhett has money now. [...] Scarlett says that they should run away together. [...] Ashley refuses but admits that he loves her. [...] Scarlett plans to find Rhett and get the money from him.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Hayrettin Kilic of Ferrara University {{speaking}} at a conference jointly organised by the Kars City Council and Kafkas University responded that, [...] "The risk is tremendous. Metsamor nuclear power plant {{is not a problem}} of Kars, Ağrı, Igdir, Yerevan and Nakhichevan but a problem of Turkey, Georgia and all Armenia. This is a regional problem." [...] Igdir Mayor Nurettin Aras stated, [...] "We are in danger of a disaster. We will apply for the closing down of the nuclear plant," [...] and Kars Mayor Naif Alibeyoglu confirmed that, [...] "We are doing everything to close this plant, but not <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> our power. It is essential that state authorities attend to this matter closely," [...] and, [...] "The Turkish government should start an initiative for the closure of the plant. Both Turkish and Armenian people should be aware of [...] danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Ilan Pappé supports Katz and his thesis, and {{has challenged}} the Israeli veterans {{to take him}} to court, claiming he has evidence that the massacre occurred. In his 2001 article in the Journal of Palestine Studies, Pappé defended the use of oral history with reference to the USA. He pointed out that that history was obtained by Katz, not only from Palestinian villagers, but also from Israeli soldiers. Pappé provided new evidence that had come to light after Katz had presented his thesis, in one case quoting (with reference to the IDF source file) [...] "from a document from the Alexandroni Brigade to IDF headquarters in June notes: 'We have tended to the mass grave, and <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> order'”, and in another, published testimonies by eyewitnesses who had been located in Syria. He also related the background to Katz's original signed repudiation of his thesis.|$|E
2500|$|Working with Heide Museum for Rings of Saturn, firstly {{we agreed}} on a maquette. Then when I saw the site I knew I had to enlarge the work to do what I call 'conquer the {{landscape}}'. The Australian landscape is an enormously powerful landscape; vast and with clarity of atmosphere, {{and you never know}} in advance how work will look in it. [...] The landscape grips my imagination – I try to measure my work against the vast spaces of this country. Conquering the landscape does not rely on scale but simplicity and clarity of form expressing inner strength and tension. If my sculpture is outdoors or in the public domain I like it to arouse people's curiosity to explore the work. Multidimensional objects look different from every angle. The exciting thing about outdoor sculpture is the change with the light, the weather... <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> constant flux. It becomes almost a living entity.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hanina deduced from [...] that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{the hand}} of Heaven except the fear of Heaven, for [...] says: [...] "What does the Lord your God ask of you, but only to fear the Lord your God." [...] The Gemara asked whether the fear of Heaven was such a little thing that [...] says [...] "only." [...] Rabbi Hanina said in the name Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that God has in God's {{treasury}} nothing but a store {{of the fear of}} Heaven, as [...] says: [...] "The fear of the Lord is His treasure," [...] and thus the fear of Heaven must be a great thing. The Gemara responded that for Moses, the fear of Heaven was a small thing, for he had it. Rabbi Hanina illustrated with a parable: If a man is asked for a big article and he has it, it seems like a small article to him; if he is asked for a small article and he does not have it, it seems like a big article to him.|$|E
6000|$|... {{was what}} I wrote. Not {{only was the}} line elegantly sonorous; it was also, I flattered myself, very aptly compendiously expressive. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the word carminative--a detailed, exact foreground, an immense, {{indefinite}} hinterland of suggestion.|$|R
