50|$|Outside of the UK, Belisha beacons {{are perhaps}} most {{prominent}} in New Zealand, {{where they are}} required at all marked pedestrian crossings. Traffic regulations require a controlling authority to erect on each pole indicating the presence and position of a pedestrian crossing either an internally <b>illuminated</b> amber <b>globe</b> not less than 300 mm in diameter, which has a lamp that provides 40 to 60 flashes per minute, or a 400 mm diameter fluorescent orange disk. The pole must be erected within 2 metres of each end of a crossing. The poles must be not less than 75 mm in diameter and not less than 2 metres in height, and must be clearly painted with alternate parallel bands of black and of white, each having a width of approximately 300 mm. Disks are a relatively new addition {{as a replacement for}} <b>illuminated</b> <b>globes,</b> having only become prominent since the 1990s.|$|R

50|$|From {{the outside}} of the building, it looks like a {{brilliant}} <b>illuminated</b> <b>globe.</b> The 35’-diameter hemisphere is covered with thousands of full-color LEDs. Colorful video and special effects, along with animations provided by YESCO’s media services group, are displayed on the globe’s surface, telling the NBC story. When it was first turned on, it literally stopped traffic on West 49th Street.|$|E
50|$|The promotional {{video was}} {{directed}} by Academy Award-winning actress Diane Keaton and features an appearance of Carlisle's husband Morgan Mason. It also features children wearing black masks and a cape while each of them holds an <b>illuminated</b> plastic <b>globe.</b> Carlisle appeared wearing a strapless dress and later changed to a black off-the-shoulder blouse. The video was partially filmed at Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park in Valencia, California, on the Spin Out ride.|$|R
5000|$|Despite many {{attempts}} to revive show globes, they have disappeared from American pharmacies. By the early 20th century, new stores shunned them, {{and they were}} disappearing from many older pharmacies. Renewed support for the globes in the 1930s moved the Owens-Illinois Glass Company to introduce a new style with an electric bulb inside to <b>illuminate</b> the <b>globe.</b> [...] Through the 1950s, American Druggist urged pharmacists {{to bring back the}} show globe, terming it [...] "the greatest trademark ever invented." ...|$|R

They scramble inside as the Angels start to follow, and the Doctor directs the group to the ship's oxygen factory, a forest contained within the ship. As they pass the primary control room, the Doctor notices a familiar crack in its wall, leaking time energy that the Angels are being drawn to.|$|R
5000|$|Confetti snow {{rained down}} on the stage, {{representing}} the fickle nature of Melbourne's weather, as Sarah Blasko performed a Neil Finn and Crowded House hit, Don't Dream It's Over. Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys played [...] "Rally around the Drum", before flag bearers for each country raised flags, {{in the same order}} of continental region that they had done in the opening ceremony, starting with England and finishing with Australia. An <b>illuminated</b> <b>globe</b> suspended in the centre was lowered with Australia, upside down, highlighted in red, and on top of the world. Notably, Melbourne City Council's Mayor, Lord Mayor John So was included in the proceedings, to rapturous applause of the crowd, who continued to cheer as his name was read out throughout the ceremony.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{popularity}} {{was probably}} {{influenced by the}} <b>illuminated</b> glass <b>globe</b> which was the central {{focal point of the}} modernist garden shown at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris, in 1925. The [...] "Jardin d’Eau et de Lumière" [...] was triangular in shape, largely consisting of tiered triangular reflecting pools and planting beds. At the center of the ensemble was an electrically propelled and internally illuminated sphere of stained glass. [...] "The mirror globe turning slowly to reflect lights is rather a night-club trick than a serious attempt at garden decoration. But it is completely successful in focusing the interest and relieving, by its unexpected location, what would otherwise be an altogether stiff pattern." [...] Other modernist garden designs followed, using plain metal or glass mirror globes; notable examples included several roof top gardens developed by Department Stores in London, America and Australia. This probably made the ispread the idea ...|$|R
5000|$|The meme {{was begun}} when a {{photograph}} of President Trump, Saudi Arabia King Salman, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi touching a glowing orb was released (via tweet) on May 21, 2017 by the Saudi Arabian embassy in the United States. The touching of the orb - a decorative <b>illuminated</b> world <b>globe</b> - {{was part of the}} ceremonial opening of the Global Centre for Combating Extremist Ideology (called [...] "Etidal") in Riyadh, an institution designed to counter militant ideology and messaging with over 200 analysts monitoring extremist propaganda and communications internationally on traditional and on-line platforms. This took place during President Trump's spring 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, his first international journey. The placing of hands on the globe symbolized the national leaders' combined commitment to ending terrorism, and signaled the activation of a four-minute welcome video on nearby viewscreens, officially opening the centre. President Trump had, in an earlier speech, described the institution as a [...] "groundbreaking new center that represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization".|$|R
5000|$|The Bal Mabille {{was opened}} in 1831 by Monsieur Mabille, a dance instructor, and was {{originally}} only for his pupils. It was later {{opened to the}} public, and in 1844 his sons decided to refurbish it {{as a sort of}} enchanted garden, with sand paths, lawns, trees and shrubs, galleries and a grotto. It was equipped with 3,000 gas lamps, very modern for the time, and was thus able to stay open after dark. Coloured-glass <b>globes</b> <b>illuminated</b> the areas under trees, and strings of lights and chandeliers were suspended between them. There was an area with a roof for protection from rain, and the grounds contained a Chinese pavilion, artificial palm trees, and a merry-go-round. Charles Monselet described it as [...] "gilded from top to bottom: trees, benches, vases, flowers ... nature glistening in gold, silver and precious stones".|$|R
25|$|The Egyptian Hall created c.1803, it is {{situated}} beneath the North Hall {{to which it}} is connected by the staircase by the east wall which was inserted at this time, and was created as the winter entrance, linked to the Porte-cochère created at the same time, beneath the North Portico with ramps connecting to the forecourt to allow carriages to pick up and set down passengers under cover. Decorated in the Egyptian style of decoration. The room has inward sloping walls and a vaulted ceiling, the western end of the room has a recess flanked by two Egyptian style lotus columns that originally contained a heating stove {{in the form of a}} carved sarcophagus, removed in 1922. The frieze around the ceiling is decorated with a winged solar disk, the symbol of the god Ra and uraeus between falcon wings, alternate with Ankh the symbol of life flanked by sceptres symbols of power. There is an <b>illuminated</b> sun <b>globe</b> over the south door. Also sold in 1922 were seven canvas sepia paintings on the walls which depicted Egyptian figures and hieroglyphics and two sculptures of Sphinxes that used to be at the base of the staircase. The designer of the room is not known for certain, though Sir John Soane implied in a lecture that the 1st Marquess was responsible for the concept. In 2012 all the missing decoration and sculpture was recreated, returning the room to its original form.|$|R
