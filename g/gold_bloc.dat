5000|$|But the <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> {{countries}} recommitted {{themselves to}} maintain a stable rate of exchange of their currencies at the 1933 international economic conference in London, by which time 35 countries, including the United States and Italy, had abandoned the gold standard.

Internal trade failed to solve their problems, however, and by 1935 only France, Switzerland and the Netherlands remained in this <b>gold</b> <b>bloc.</b> When France finally decided to accept devaluation in 1936, the Netherlands {{had no choice but}} to follow. While the Netherlands had been so reluctant to drop the gold standard, it quickly brought an economic boost after years of decline. In 1936 the Dutch stock market started climbing again, trade slowly recovered and unemployment stopped growing. Finally the country could now profit from the ongoing economic recovery that had been taking place for many of its trading partners.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a diplomat}} in the 1930s, Carr took {{the view that}} great {{division}} of the world into rival trading blocs caused by the American Smoot Hawley Act of 1930 was the principal cause of German belligerence in foreign policy, as Germany was now unable to export finished goods or import raw materials cheaply. In Carrs opinion, if Germany could be given its own economic zone to dominate in Eastern Europe comparable to the British Imperial preference economic zone, the U.S. dollar zone in the Americas, the French <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> zone and the Japanese economic zone, then {{the peace of the}} world could be assured. In a memo written on 30 January 1936, Carr wrote:"Since I think everyone is now agreed that it is dangerous to sit indefinitely on the safety-valve, and that Germany must expand somewhere, I feel that there is an overwhelming case for the view that the direction in which Germany can expand with a minimum of danger or inconvenience to British interests (whether political or economic) is in Central and South-Eastern Europe..." [...] Carrs views on appeasement caused much tension with his superior, the Permanent Undersecretary Sir Robert Vansittart, and played a role in Carrs resignation from the Foreign Office later in 1936 In an article entitled [...] "An English Nationalist Abroad" [...] published in May 1936 in the Spectator, Carr wrote [...] "The methods of the Tudor sovereigns, when they were making the English nation, invite many comparisons with those of the Nazi regime in Germany" [...] In this way, Carr argued that it was hypocritical for people in Britain to criticize the Nazi regimes human rights record Because of Carrs strong antagonism to the Treaty of Versailles, which he viewed as unjust to Germany, Carr was very supportive of the Nazi regimes efforts to destroy Versailles through moves such as the Remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936 Carr later wrote of his views in the 1930s that [...] "No doubt, I was very blind".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> {{operated}} between France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium, especially {{over the period}} after the USA left the gold standard in March 1933 to its end in September 1936.

Juxtaposed is the view of leading political scientists, such as Henry Kissinger, who see impending war in Europe as deeply and adversely affecting psychology in Europe, and what may be called the standard "economists' view" that sees {{the demise of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> as being caused almost exclusively by economic factors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{experience}} of Switzerland’s devaluation in 1936. The Swiss case is of interest because Switzerland was a key member of the <b>gold</b> <b>bloc,</b> {{and much of the}} modern academic literature on the Great Depression tries to explain why Switzerland and the other <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> countries, France, and the Netherlands, remained on the gold standard until the bitter end. We ask the following questions: what were the issues at stake in the political debate? What was the cost to Switzerland of the delay in the franc devaluation? What would have been {{the costs and benefits of}} an earlier exchange rate policy? More specifically, what would have happened if Switzerland had either joined the British and devalued in September 1931, or followed the United States in April 1933 ? To answer these questions we construct a simple open economy macro model of the interwar Swiss economy. On the basis of this model we then posit counterfactual scenarios of alternative exchange rate pegs in 1931 and 1933. Our simulations clearly show a significant and large increase in real economic activity. If Switzerland had devalued with Britain in 1931, the output level in 1935 would have been some 18 per cent higher than it actually was in that year. If Switzerland had waited until 1933 to devalue, the improvement would have been about 15 per cent higher. The reasons Switzerland di...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} Italy s {{integration into}} the international capital market following the First World War. Abundant inflows of foreign capital subsequently clashed with the stringent monetary policy that accompanied the Lira revaluation and consequently were partially sterilised. During {{the aftermath of the}} world crisis, foreign funds withdrew from Italian firms {{as a consequence of the}} precarious equilibrium in which the <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> countries found themselves, once other currencies devalued or became prone to devaluation. The resulting isolation from the world financial market raised the need for a domestic solution to the liquidity crisis, and the creations of IMI and IRI are viewed as part of the resultant process of the Italian credit system s overall restructuring. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{historical}} {{accounts of the}} world economic crisis of the 1930 s, Switzerland {{is known for its}} staunch defense of the gold standard and the rise of corporatist policies. Yet, so far, the literature has not discussed the implications of these two features. This paper tries to show how the combination of hard-currency policy and nominal rigidities introduced by corporatist policies proved to be fatal for growth. Estimating a New Keynesian small open economy model for the period 1926 - 1938, we show that the decision to participate in the <b>Gold</b> <b>Bloc</b> after 1933 at an overvalued currency can be identified as the main reason for the unusual long lasting recession and that price rigidities from 1931 to 1936 significantly slowed down the adjustment process...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} first {{widespread}} use of capital controls {{in response to a}} global or regional financial crisis. In particular, we analyze whether capital controls mitigated capital flight in the 1930 s and assess their causal effects on macroeconomic recovery from the Great Depression. We find evidence that they stemmed gold outflows in the year following their imposition; however, time-shifted, difference-indifferences (DD) estimates of industrial production, prices, and exports suggest that exchange controls did not accelerate macroeconomic recovery relative to countries that went off gold and floated. Countries imposing capital controls also appear to perform similar to the <b>gold</b> <b>bloc</b> countries once the latter group of countries finally abandoned gold. Time series regressions further demonstrate that countries imposing capital controls refrained from fully utilizing their newly acquired monetary policy autonomy. Even so, capital controls remained in place as instruments for manipulating trade flows and for preserving foreign exchange for the repayment of external debt. ...|$|E
