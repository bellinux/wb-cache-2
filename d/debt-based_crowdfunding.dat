5000|$|<b>Debt-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "peer to peer", [...] "P2P", [...] "marketplace lending", or [...] "crowdlending") arose with the {{founding}} of Zopa in the UK in 2005 and in the US in 2006, with the launches of Lending Club and Prosper.com. Borrowers apply online, generally for free, and their application is reviewed and verified by an automated system, which also determines the borrower's credit risk and interest rate. Investors buy securities in a fund which makes the loans to individual borrowers or bundles of borrowers. Investors make money from interest on the unsecured loans; the system operators make money by taking {{a percentage of the}} loan and a loan servicing fee. In 2009, institutional investors entered the P2P lending arena; for example in 2013, Google invested $125 million in Lending Club. In 2014 in the US, P2P lending totalled about $5 billion. In 2014 in the UK, P2P platforms lent businesses £749 million, a growth of 250% from 2012 to 2014, and lent retail customers £547 million, a growth of 108% from 2012 to 2014. In both countries in 2014, about 75% of all the money transferred through crowdfunding went through P2P platforms. [...] Lending Club went public in December 2014 at a valuation around $9 billion.Debt crowdfunding in the U.S. further evolved with the 2016 enactment of Title III of the JOBS Act, which allows unaccredited investors to invest directly in private businesses through regulated Funding Portals or Broker-Dealers.|$|E
50|$|The {{crowdfunding}} {{activities in}} Portugal {{had not been}} targeted by legislation until 2015. The first equity crowdfunding platform to receive the regulatory approval from the UK Financial Services Authority was Seedrs, co-founded by Portuguese Carlos Silva. SyndicateRoom another online UK-based equity crowdfunding was also co-funded by Portuguese Gonçalo de Vasconcelo. Some of Portugal's crowdfunding platforms are PPL, a donation and reward-based crowdfunding platform for funding every kind of projects, MassiveMov, founded in 2011 aiming to be a funding alternative for innovative projects and Raize, a <b>debt-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> platform. Novo Banco Crowdfunding is another initiative in partnership with PPL which aims {{to raise money for}} social projects promoted by NGOs and charities and are 10% co-financed by NOVO BANCO, founded in 2011 aiming to be a funding alternative for innovative projects. The Portuguese crowdfunding legislation, Lei 102/2015 de 24 de agosto Regime jurídico do financiamento colaborativo states that from now on crowdfunding will be monitored by CMVM(Securities Market Commission) and every platform needs to be registered at DGC (General Consumer Office). It recognizes four types of crowdfunding: donation, reward, equity and debt. According to the law, the investors can receive the money back if the announced conditions are not complied. CMVM is given 3 months to create the supervision norms and regulations to be applied in this area but the new rules apply only to projects that start after the publication of the law.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} economics of electronic commerce and social networks. The first essay, "Market Mechanisms in Online Crowdfunding," systematically compares auctions with a platform-mandated posted-price mechanism in online crowdfunding. We exploit a regime change from auctions to platform-mandated posted prices on a <b>debt-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> platform. We develop a game-theoretic model that yields empirically testable hypotheses, then test them using detailed transactions data. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that after the regime change, loans are funded with higher probability and higher interest rates. More important, all else equal, loans funded under the posted-price regime {{are more likely to}} default. While the posted prices may be faster than auctions that rely on the "crowd" to discover prices, auctions are not necessarily inferior in terms of overall social welfare. The essay, "'Smart Money': Institutional Investors in Online Crowdfunding," studies institutional investors and their interactions with retail investors in online crowdfunding. Given their expertise, institutional investors are often referred to as "smart money" in financial markets, in the sense that these professional have selection ability and receive higher returns from their securities. We study whether institutional investors are indeed better able to screen borrowers in the marketplace than, and have any significant impacts on the behaviors of, retail investors. We find that although institutional investors indeed behave differently in terms of portfolio size and diversification strategies, their portfolios do not necessarily outperform those of retail investors. Institutional investors' bids have significant influence on the bidding strategies of retail investors, as well as final transaction outcomes. We find that this phenomenon is driven by the designation of "institutional investors" rather than just the size of their portfolios. The last essay, "For Whom to Tweet? A Study of a Large-Scale Social Network," studies the effects of peer-groups sizes on individuals' contributions to public goods - tweets - in a large-scale and influential online social network. We attribute the highly-skewed distribution of tweets, which is observed from the network, to an individual's conflicting incentives of free-riding and maximizing social influence. We exploit the asymmetry of an individual's peer groups (followers and followees, groups of people following and being followed by the individual respectively) to disentangle these incentives, and devise empirical strategies to deal with the endogenous formation of one's peer groups. We find a larger group of followees leads an individual to tweet less, while a larger group of followers leads an individual to tweet more. With randomly generated 1 % new links the total tweets will increase by 25 % as the estimated follower effects dominate the followee effects...|$|E
