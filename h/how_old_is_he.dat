60|$|Her manner was warm; she {{had never}} seen so clearly before how {{distinguished}} and desirable a girl this was. She asked after old Jolyon's health.

60|$|It came to Saxon with a chill pang {{that she}} <b>was</b> surely <b>older</b> than Billy. She stole {{glances at the}} {{smoothness}} of his face, and the essential boyishness of him, so much desired, shocked her. Of course he would marry some girl years younger than himself, than herself. <b>How</b> <b>old</b> <b>was</b> <b>he?</b> Could it <b>be</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too young for her? As he seemed to grow inaccessible, she was drawn toward him more compellingly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> so strong, so gentle. She lived over {{the events of the}} day. There was no flaw there. He had considered her and Mary, always. And he had torn the program up and danced only with her. Surely he had liked her, or he would not have done it.|$|R

5000|$|Stump was {{characterized}} {{in the media}} as a crowd favorite at the 2009 Westminister show. Stump was named [...] "Best in Show" [...] in part because judges felt he had a [...] "cheerful and tractable disposition" [...] {{in keeping with the}} breed's standard. Among the front-runners Stump defeated were Tiger Woods the Scottish deerhound, Spirit the Giant Schnauzer and Lincoln the Brussels griffon. Judge Tietjen, who did not make her decision to crown Stump the victor until the last moment, said: “I didn’t know who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> or <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>He’s</b> just everything that you’d want in the breed, and I couldn’t say no to him.” Stump became the oldest dog to win the title, a distinction previously held by Kirby, an eight-year-old Papillon and the 1999 winner.|$|R

The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> - <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 13 years <b>old.</b> Earl <b>was</b> returned to school.

50|$|Because the birthdate of Montagna is unknown, {{there is}} also debate as to when exactly {{he began his career}} and <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at the time.

50|$|He became world {{champion}} in São Paulo in 1982. After that he garnered attention for his humorous or even eccentric personality.

50|$|Publius Cornelius Scipio {{was born}} by Caesarian section into the Scipio {{branch of the}} Cornelia gens.

60|$|It was occasioned, I suppose, by {{the reverend}} nature of respectability in the abstract, but I felt {{particularly}} young in this man's presence. <b>How</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> himself, I could not guess--and that again {{went to his}} credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty.|$|R

60|$|When {{people in}} our set are introduced, it is {{customary}} for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> It was not really a happy question to ask him; {{it was like an}} examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.|$|R

His date of birth is unknown. In dispute <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{executed}} by the Inquisition. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> known to history for his resistance to Christian evangelization. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> burnt at the stake on November 30, 1539 at the order of Bishop Don Juan de Zumárraga, the first Catholic bishop of New Spain, for continuing to practice the pre-Hispanic religion. The main source of information on Don Carlos is the record of his inquisition trial, published in 1910 by the Mexican archives.Don Carlos was a grandson of the famous Texcocan ruler Nezahualcoyotl through his son Nezahualpilli.

60|$|Uncle Ebenezer trudged in the ditch, jogging {{from side}} to side like an old ploughman coming home from work. He never said a word the whole way; and I was thrown for talk on the cabin-boy. He told me his name was Ransome, and that he had {{followed}} the sea since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> nine, but could not say <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> as <b>he</b> had lost his reckoning. He showed me tattoo marks, baring his breast in the teeth of the wind and in spite of my remonstrances, for I thought it was enough to kill him; he swore horribly whenever he remembered, but more like a silly schoolboy than a man; and boasted of many wild and bad things that he had done: stealthy thefts, false accusations, ay, and even murder; but all with such a dearth of likelihood in the details, and such a weak and crazy swagger in the delivery, as disposed me rather to pity than to believe him.|$|R

5000|$|Complex {{systems of}} dactylonomy {{were used in}} the ancient world. The Greco-Roman author Plutarch, in his Lives, {{mentions}} finger counting as being used in Persia in the first centuries AD, so the source of the system may lie in Iran. The practice was later used widely in medieval Islamic lands. The earliest reference to this method of using the hands to refer to the natural numbers may have been in some Prophetic traditions going back to the early days of Islam, more than fourteen centuries ago. In one tradition as reported by Yusayra the Prophet Muhammad enjoined upon his female companions to express praise to God and to count using their fingers (=واعقدن بالأنامل [...] )( [...] سنن الترمذي). In Arabic, dactylonomy is known as [...] "Number reckoning by finger folding" [...] (=حساب العقود [...] ). The practice was well known in the Arabic-speaking world and was quite commonly used as evidenced by the numerous references to it in Classical Arabic literature. Poets could allude to a miser by saying that his hand made [...] "ninety-three", i.e. a closed fist, the sign of avarice. When an <b>old</b> man <b>was</b> asked <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> could answer by showing a closed fist, meaning 93.The gesture for 50 was used by some poets (for example Ibn Al-Moutaz) to describe the beak of the goshawk.|$|R
