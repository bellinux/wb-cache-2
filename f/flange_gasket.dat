These sculptures are built of found lengths of {{assorted}} materials; ski poles, curtain rods, plastic pipe, wood molding - the structure becoming a metaphor for the manifold influences on a city. In another series of constructed ‘Pie Chart’ paintings (based on socio-cultural surveys), Colson mocks the deluge of analysis that is {{so much a part of}} our daily experience by playing up the material and iconographic elements to such a degree that any actual understanding is subverted. Colson’s 'Elliptical Models' paintings incorporate, at once, the ordinary and the profound - while suggesting preposterous hierarchies using the formal through-line of the circle. Sharon Mizota, in her Los Angeles Times review of Colson’s 2010 exhibition at William Griffin Gallery (now Kayne Griffin Corcoran), characterized these works as “grand and hilarious testaments to the leveling effect of data overload. [...] "One piece includes concentric circles depicting ‘5 Steps to Happiness,’ ‘Flea Life Cycle,’ ‘The Cycle of Addiction,’ and for good measure, a <b>flange</b> <b>gasket.</b> The piece levels the distinctions between these wide-ranging phenomena in an absurdly uninformative information graphic.” More recently, Colson has designed and created large-scale outdoor sculptures.|$|E

However while en route, during routine maintenance to the ship's fuel oil systems in the No. 1 machinery room on 11 December 1973, a <b>flange</b> <b>gasket</b> failed {{in one of the}} fuel transfer tubes of JP5 that pass through Number 1 engine room. Jet fuel was sprayed, atomized, and ignited and the ship went to General Quarters for nearly 38 hours. Due to the massive amounts of thick black smoke the crew was ordered topside to flight deck until the fire could be controlled and smoke cleared. Because two and then three of the ship's four propulsion systems had to be shut down during the fire, Kitty Hawk began list to about 7 degrees portside and as a result many of the aircraft were moved starboard in an attempt to balance the ship until the fire was finally brought under control and two propulsion systems restored. Kitty Hawk then headed toward the Philippines where she ported in Subic Bay until the ship's damage could be assessed and repairs could be made, but there would be three days of waiting before reaching port. Six enlisted sailors died in the fire: FR Michael Deverich, FR Linn Schambers, FR Kevin Johnson, FA Alan Champine, Samuel Cardenas and FA Joseph Tulipana. Thirty-four sailors were treated for smoke inhalation and several minor injuries and one sailor for a broken wrist reported. The bodies of those men who died in the fire were escorted home by members of their respective Divisions for burial.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating bolted flanged pipe joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration.

A bolted flange joint in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of <b>flange,</b> <b>gasket,</b> bolts, and washers. The success of a bolted flanged pipe joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed bolted flanged pipe joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing.

40|$|Lecturepg. 61 Chemical {{and process}} plants usually contain {{numerous}} valves and pumps {{in a complex}} network of pipe runs. Plant design and pump selection are usually based on steady state design conditions. However, the opening or closing of valves, or the starting or tripping of pumps, in the system can generate high unsteady pressures that can damage piping and components in the system along with the pumping machinery itself. These unsteady pressures can result in large forces that are reacted at the pump nozzles. These loads can lead to casing failures or extrusion of the <b>flange</b> <b>gasket.</b> The radial and axial thrust bearings are directly impacted and premature failure is a possibility well before the B 10 life based on steady loading has been reached. There are several simple formulae {{that can be used}} to determine the order of magnitude of the pressure pulsations that are generated due to various system upsets. However, accurate modelling requires a numerical solution that can be performed on today?s high end personal computers. The numerical simulation is used together with a new remote monitoring system recently introduced by the authors? company. This technology has simplified the collection of real-time accurate field data during all phases of pump operation.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{development}} work associated with the design of vacuum components for the Thermonuclear Project, a program was initiated for the testing of high vacuum bakeable <b>flange</b> and <b>gasket</b> designs for leak-tight sealing requirements. The <b>flange</b> and <b>gasket</b> components, chosen for the initial study because of the simplicity in design and low yield point of the gasket material, consisted of the fully annealed, type 1100, aluminum alloy compressed between plane flange surfaces which had a 32 mu in. -rms finish. Leak-tight sealing of the 99 % aluminum, 10 -inch wire was found to be dependent on the yield point and creep properties of the alloy. It was demonstrated, (1) that sealing was accomplished when the bolt loaded flange exceeded the yield point of the strain hardened gasket, and (2) the life of the gasket was dependent on the rate of deformation during thermal cycling between room temperature and 250 deg C. It was possible to maintain a satisfactory vacuum seal STA< 10 /sup - 9 / torr liter-sec/sup - 1 /-(gasket in.) /sup - 1 /! for more than 18 thermal cycles with four hours per bake at the elevated temperature.

40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes – Part 2 Full scale experimental investigationsLeakage that sometimes occurs in flange joints in large size plastic pipelines for water supply {{is a serious}} problem. Research was undertaken {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the function of such flange joints. The objectives were partly to find out the degree of sensitivity of the design, i e if small deviations from recommended practise is critical, partly to be able to suggest improved design and mounting procedures. One part of the investigation was a numerical (FEM) study of several geometries, which was reported in [2]. Use of a time-dependent material model made it possible to follow the development of deformations and flange surface pressures for long times. Although several important principal findings were made, the tightening procedure and exact material behaviour could not be modelled. Therefore a series of full-scale experiments were made on 630 mm pipes, for a number of combinations of <b>flange</b> dimension and <b>gasket</b> type. This second part of the research is reported here. Since four of the twenty bolts were instrumented, the bolt forces could be monitored and be related to the torque and to the pressure in the pipe over time. This resulted in novel, important information about the functioning of plastic flange joints. In short, the experiments were performed in the following way. First, the bolts were tightened in the recommended criss-cross fashion to pre-determined torque levels. Then the pressure in the pipe was increased until leakage occurred. For combinations of <b>flanges,</b> <b>gaskets</b> and torques where the joint was tight for pressures above 13 bars, the 13 bar pressure level was maintained for up to one week. The relationship between bolt force and torque does not agree at all with the frequently used rule of thumb formula, for the galvanized bolts used here. The bolt force was typically less than half the value obtained by the formula. Hence it is critical to verify the friction for the used combination of bolt material, surface treatment, and lubrication. The bolt forces also appear to be unevenly distributed, which is partly due to successive creep during the tightening procedure. For the high stresses in the flange creep is significant already for so short times as a few minutes, and the effect is increased {{by the fact that the}} bolts and backing rings are much stiffer than the plastic flange. For both the wide and the narrow (ISO) flange type used it appears that rubber gaskets perform better, in the sense that the joint is tight for lower applied torques. The hyper- elastic material properties help to smooth unevenness in the flange surface and to compensate for creep in the plastic. Use of SDR 17 pipes at pressure levels of 13 bars means considerable creep expansion of the pipe, although it is possible to obtain a tight joint. The expansion gives a wringing effect at the flange, also observed in [2], which contributes to concentrate the flange pressure to the outer parts of the flange surface. In summary, flange joints are possible to mount so that they are tight, also for 630 mm pipes. Since the design is a sensitive one it is vital to follow recommendations for 4 mounting of different combinations of <b>flanges</b> and <b>gaskets.</b> In particular, knowledge about the relationship between torque and bolt force is important...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStandard {{circular}} ConFlat® (CF) flanges {{are widely}} used in industry due to their high sealing reliability after being subjected to a bakeout process. The Beam Gas Ionisation (BGI) instrument for the CERN Proton Synchrotron accelerator will require a CF-like rectangular sealing system.

40|$|Investments in gas {{distribution}} networks are very high, exceeding worldwide {{hundreds of billions}} of euros. The replacement of pieces too early results loss of capital. However, by too late replacement safety and security of supply may be in serious danger. This project is focused in distribution pipelines, composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters and low pressure, used to take the products to the final consumer. More specifically union joints and <b>flange</b> <b>gaskets</b> are studied. In the field of gasket and seals, gaskets are generally associated with mating flanges of a mechanical joint while seals are generally associated with moving parts. Some designers refer to gaskets as static seals but this is not really true since the relationship between a gasket and its mating flanges is dynamic in nature due to the dynamic deformations associated with internal pressure, vibration, external forces and thermal expansion or contraction. The main objective of this project is the study of low pressure gaskets for gas pipelines. Some gas companies are continuously spending money and resources on improve the lifetime of their installations and achieve the regulations required. The first part of this paper is an analysis and description of gasket design, including calculation of union joints, styles of flanges and factors that affect the performance. Then a description of the common gasket materials and gasket configurations is done, complemented with installation advices and troubleshooting. Following, a complete description of standardized test procedures for determination of leakage, creep and stress relaxation of gasket materials is done, using information from different sources like ASTM, DIN, EN and ISO standards.
