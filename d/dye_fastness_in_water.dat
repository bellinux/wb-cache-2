The optimum dyeing conditions of the cow leather dyed with Lac powder were 30 %, 40, 30 : 1,℃ 30 minutes, and 4 repetitions. The K/S values were higher in post mordant than pre mordanting condition.

A revival of commercial interest in natural dyes has opened several research avenues. This paper investigates the application by padding of cotton fabric with 10 g/l of two natural dyes {{derived from the}} Acacia plant family. Three mordanting techniques were studied; of which post-mordanting produced the most even shade. Among the two mordants investigated, the use of copper sulfate resulted in a level beige shade at 15 g/l concentration while ferrous sulfate performed best at 5 g/l yielding a yellow-grey shade. An optimum process-sequence for the copper sulfate mordant was "pad (dye) ¨dry¨steam followed by pad (mordant) ¨steam¨dry", and for ferrous sulfite it was "pad (dye) ¨steam¨dry followed by pad (mordant) ¨steam¨dry". Typically a change in mordant resulted in a different shade with the same dye.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Low-pressure glow {{discharges}} are {{efficient in}} generating uniform plasmas. They {{have been applied}} in the surface modification {{of a variety of}} materials. But most of these applications are limited to small-scales because of their reliance on vacuum equipments needed to sustain processes at low pressure. This work aims at commending a continuous surface treatment device, which meets the requirement of textile material surface modification by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) at atmospheric pressure for industry production. In the experiment, quasi-glow-discharge, a glow-discharge like plasma, is produced under atmospheric pressure with the continuous simple device. Through the discharge of mixture of argon and oxygen, Ar-O 2 (10 : 1), polyester fabric is continuously modified. The results reveal that the dyeability of the polyester fabric is dramatically improved. The spectral value (K/S) of the dyed polyester fabric is increased by about 50 %, and the relative dye up-take is also increased by about 18 % after the treatment. The <b>dyeing</b> <b>fastness</b> of the modified material remains the highest degree. That is to say, the improvement of the dyeability does not degrade the <b>dyeing</b> <b>fastness</b> of the material at all. The study of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the smooth and glossy surface of polyester fiber becomes rough after the treatment. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) illustrates that Ar-O 2 (10 : 1) discharge can help generate a few carboxyl groups in the polyester fiber surface.

A finishing process on samples was performed before dyeing by means of 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) using a pad dry cure method. Such experiments as wrinkle recovery test (AATCC- 128), water drop test and <b>dye</b> <b>fastness</b> determination (ISO 105 -C 01) were conducted to understand how current treatment impacted the cotton fabrics’ properties.

30|$|Current {{union dyeing}} {{processes}} rely {{on one or}} two dye baths with one or two dyes for cotton/nylon blend fabrics. For 50 : 50 cotton/nylon fabrics, cotton is dyed first under alkaline condition with reactive dyes and then the nylon is dyed with acid dyes under acidic condition. Atmospheric plasma- nano Chitosan treatment as an environmentally friendly method was employed to modify surface properties of cotton/nylon blend fabrics to develop union dyeing with acid dyes. Cellulose fibers when immersed <b>in</b> <b>water</b> produce a negative electro-kinetic potential. The negative charge on the fiber repels the anionic dye ions and consequently the exhaustion of the dye bath is limited. When the fabric is treated with chitosan, the primary hydroxyl groups of cellulose is partially modified into amide groups, which intern leads the cellulose to act like as polyamide fiber. Experimental work was carried out on finding the possibility of one bath dyeing of plasma- chitosan pretreated cotton/nylon fabric with acid dyes. Plasma treated cotton/nylon surface characteristics were evaluated using FTIR. The surface activation using air plasma introduces different functional groups in cotton/nylon blend fabric.
