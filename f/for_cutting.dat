40|$|Abstract. According to the {{principle}} producing the cutting track of cutter, to study {{the influence of the}} cutting track of cutter on the process of high speed ball-end milling, the single-factor models <b>for</b> evaluating the <b>cutting</b> track of cutter are established. Adopting four kinds of the typical cutting track of cutter, the experiment of high speed ball-end milling is processed. The model of multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation <b>for</b> the <b>cutting</b> track of cutter is established, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation <b>for</b> the <b>cutting</b> track of high speed ball-end milling cutter is accomplished by the application of fuzzy mathematics theory. Results show that the cutting contact curve of cutter affects directly the process of high speed ball-end milling, fuzzy and uncertain properties exist in the evaluation <b>for</b> the <b>cutting</b> track of cutter. The optimum cutting track can be selected by multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation <b>for</b> the <b>cutting</b> track of high speed ball-end milling cutter...|$|R

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which work well <b>for</b> rip <b>cutting</b> {{do not work}} well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used <b>for</b> rip <b>cutting,</b> and a {{separate}} chop or miter saw, which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed <b>for</b> rip <b>cutting</b> have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed <b>for</b> cross <b>cutting.</b> There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|R

The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E

5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
