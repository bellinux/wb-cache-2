40|$|Over 400 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests are managed for timber production, comprising {{more than half}} of the remaining global permanent tropical forest estate. A growing proportion of tropical production forests are managed under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles. The objective of SFM is to achieve multiple benefits, including forest protection, biodiversity conservation and income enhancement. However, the outcomes resulting from the implementation of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems have seldom been examined rigorously. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to assess broad-scale impacts of SFM policy in tropical forest ecosystems. As a case study, we investigated deforestation and timber production in logging concessions in the Republic of Congo after the implementation of its SFM-based forestry law in 2000. Compliance with the forestry law was incomplete, allowing a unique opportunity to compare deforestation and legal timber production outcomes in concessions that implemented SFM-based policy compared to those that did not. Quasi-experimental matching analysis indicated that deforestation in matched parcels in compliant concessions was up to 2 -times higher than matched parcels in non-compliant concessions, equivalent to 67 km 2 of forest loss for the period 2005 – 2010. Annual deforestation data demonstrated that deforestation was stable or increased in all six concessions following the respective <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> in each concession. Legal timber production increased (by 5 %, from 0. 18 to 0. 19 CBM/ha/yr) and became more stable, in compliant compared to non-compliant concessions. Our results suggest that the presence of SFM in a concession does not immediately lead to less deforestation. Rather, SFM policy may be associated with higher deforestation, because SFM is also associated with higher legal timber production, foreign capital, and international timber demand. Our findings measure short-term associations between SFM and deforestation in the Congo, and underscore the need for empirical evaluation of long-term impacts of SFM in tropical forest ecosystems worldwide...|$|E

Waste in the world each year is increasing and burdensome for the economy in terms of the cost of disposal or storage, and for the environment in terms of expanding the number of landfills. The European Union has set mandatory guidelines through a specific quantitative value of natural resources in the field of waste management, which Member States are obliged to respect. These include a minimum percentage return and recycling of packaging materials, or the maximum amount of biodegradable waste that can be stored in landfills. The Directive also set the exact <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with those commitments.

40|$|The {{leading role}} {{of the public sector}} is a key element of EU end-use energy {{efficiency}} policy. Several Community level regulatory instruments, including the Energy Services Directive (ESD), the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the new Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) include provisions focusing on the public sector. Under the ESD member states of the EU shall ensure that the public sector fulfils an exemplary role in energy end-use efficiency. Furthermore, the ESD sets out a specific list of measures in public procurement, of which two must be identified and implemented by the member states. The recast EPBD provides for an earlier <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with nearly zero-energy efficiency requirements of new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities. The new EED introduces a quantified refurbishment target for central government buildings. However, the rest of the public sector will not fall under this provision and is also excluded from energy efficiency requirements for purchasing products, services and buildings. In the first section of the article a summary is provided of the key building blocks of EU energy efficiency policy that promote the leading {{role of the}} public sector. The second section of the paper contains an overview of progress against public sector related ESD provisions based on information in the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs).

EPA’s latest Strategic Plan identifies as one of the Agency’s five strategic goals protecting {{human health and the environment}} by enforcing laws and assuring compliance. Yet, outside observers and the Agency itself have identified a series of longstanding as well as emerging challenges to effective enforcement. EPA has responded to these criticisms and challenges by embarking on what it terms a “transformative” enforcement initiative, which it calls Next Generation Compliance (“Next Gen”). Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for OECA, has emphasized that the Next Generation Compliance initiative is intended to complement traditional enforcement work, not displace it; inspections and initiation of enforcement cases against significant violators will continue to be “an essential part” of EPA’s enforcement work.

This study also intends to identify firm-specific factors that are associated with the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by firms in these countries. IFRS-compliant financial reports of 37 Russian and 17 Kazakhstan companies which disclosed the existence of goodwill were investigated. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> was measured by comparing actual disclosures made by firms with those required by IAS 36. The results indicate a generally improving trend in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian and Kazakhstan firms. However, findings suggest the existence of an unwillingness to comply with IAS 36 requirements by managers in those countries. Also the results show a higher level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms compared to that of Kazakhstan companies which may be attributed to contrasting approaches to IFRS adoption in Russia and Kazakhstan. Research findings provide evidence of a positive association of the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms with firm goodwill intensity. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Kazakhstan firms appears to be positively associated with firm size. The research suggests a lack <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> enforcement in Russia and Kazakhstan.

40|$|Background and Discussion: The {{adoption}} of the IFRS by Swedish companies was an arduous task which required {{a lot of resources}} and time. The regulations that the IFRS contain are more complex and require more extensive disclosures than Swedish companies are used to. It can be a difficult task for companies to comply with IAS 36 disclosure requirements {{and at the same time}} not to disclose too much of a company’s specific information. The importance of disclosure should not be underestimated, as more disclosures lead to lower cost of capital. Recent studies show that disclosures about goodwill impairment testing provided by companies are too general and not sufficient to enable users of financial statements to assess the reliability of goodwill impairment testing. Research Question: The research question of this thesis is to what extent company characteristics may explain the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. In order to measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> the examination <b>of</b> goodwill impairment accounting practices has been conducted. Methodology: The research question has been addressed using an empirical approach with an emphasis on note-form disclosures in the 2011 and 2011 / 2012 consolidated financial statements of Swedish firms listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. This study has examined relationships between company-specific, institutional and goodwill-related company characteristics and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36 with the help of multiple regression analysis. The degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> in this study is measured by a self-constructed index. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that a combination of examined company characteristics explain only about 9 % of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. Regarding company-specific characteristics, this study has indicated that company size has a significant impact of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements as larger companies seem to have a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance.</b> No significant relationships between company performance and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> as well as between financial needs and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> have been found in this study. The study has further indicated that degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements regarding goodwill impairment tests varies across industries and auditor firms. Finally, the results of this study show that goodwill-related characteristics do not seem to have a significant impact on the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements, as no significant relationships between the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet of the company and the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the goodwill impairment rate were found...|$|R
