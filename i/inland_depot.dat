The Admiralty {{therefore}} embarked on building a new <b>inland</b> <b>depot,</b> next to Chattenden, at Lodge Hill; opening in 1898, it dealt principally with cordite. At Upnor itself further Shell Stores {{was built in the}} 1880s, supplemented by new buildings for storing wet and dry guncotton (used in torpedoes and mines) in the 1895. These sites, which became known as Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps, were put up for sale in 2016.|$|E
30|$|If the Kra Canal {{is going}} to be realised, Malaysia needs {{to find a way to}} benefit from the canal. Diversification of {{maritime}} business by investing in regionally strategic areas, such as Langkawi in Kedah, Padang Besar in Perlis, Penang Port, Tok Bali in Kelantan, or even in neighbouring countries, including Thailand and Myammar, appears to have the potential to increase market share despite the trade route shift. Nationally, there are three potential strategies that can be implemented in the future, which are the enhancement of the Penang Port as the hub port of Malaysia; the development of an <b>inland</b> <b>depot</b> at Padang Besar, Perlis; and the establishment of Tok Bali as a bunkering port in Kelantan.|$|E

30|$|Column drop&pick in Table  1 shows which papers {{assumed that}} {{containers}} {{can be removed}} from trucks at customer locations. However, these operations can be performed only if chassis can be removed from trucks and trailers can be interchanged between different trucks. These limitations prevent drop&pick operations to work effectively in many countries (e.g. Imai et al. (2007). Generally speaking, these papers were mainly investigated {{from the point of}} view of large carriers, which operate inland networks with several depots, where containers can be temporarily stored to be picked-up and dropped-off by trucks which bypass packing and unpacking operations. However, our case study is rather that of a medium-size carrier, which cannot afford either using <b>inland</b> <b>depots</b> or the acquisition of a large container fleet.|$|R

40|$|In an {{intermodal}} transportation network, {{empty containers}} {{need to be}} repositioned {{in order to be}} able to fulfil empty container demands. At a regional level this repositioning takes place between importers, exporters, intermodal terminals, <b>inland</b> <b>depots</b> and ports. Repositioning movements with lowest costs may be determined by an empty container allocation model. Vehicle routing models may be used to find vehicle routes for performing loaded containers transports and container allocations determined by the container allocation model. Recently, approaches to integrate empty container allocations and vehicle routing have been discussed in literature. This paper shows the advantage of an integrated approach for the full-truckload problem with a vehicle capacity of a single container. Mathematical formulations for the container allocation and vehicle routing model are proposed. A model integrating the separate models is presented and numerical experiments are performed. Results show that the integrated model results in the lowest costs...|$|R
40|$|Two actual {{topics are}} studied {{in this thesis}} project. The first problem focuses on the modal shift of {{intermodal}} transport in the hinterland transport network of Maersk Line. The second problem is the repositioning of empty equipment in the transport network. An optimization model is built to optimize both aspects in one model. The scope of research was from {{point of view of}} the shipping company. It turned out that the orderdeadline, rate structure and availability of transport modalities restricts the usage of intermodal transport. The modal share of intermodal transport could rise by 50. 9 % and cost savings of 12. 9 % are possible. For the second aspect - repositioning – costs could be saved by reuse. Furthermore the model outcome shows the importance of the <b>inland</b> <b>depots</b> in the transportation network. With an optimal utilization of these depots total operational costs of hinterland transport will reduce by 15. 8 %. Transport and PlanningTransport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The inland {{repositioning}} {{of empty}} containers {{is a crucial}} problem for shipping companies providing door-to-door transport services to customers. This activity consists of the allocation of heterogeneous fleets of empty containers between <b>inland</b> <b>depots</b> and ports, {{so that they can}} be properly positioned in anticipation of future customer requests. This article describes how shipping companies perform this complex activity and its links with truck routing problems and the repositioning of empty containers on maritime networks. To address the inland repositioning of empty containers, we propose a time-extended optimization model, whose innovative elements are decision variables and constraints on the so-called flexible leased containers, which can be on-hired and off-hired according to a number of clauses, and substitution options between container types. The experimentation shows that the model is an effective instrument to support the current decision-making process on this issue, because realistic size instances can be solved within time limits imposed by planning operations...|$|R
