5000|$|The {{release of}} the album, with the {{proposed}} titles Never Odd Or Even and Zero, was postponed due to River's death.

Josh Greenbaum and Josh Mckay had readily signed a release form allowing their tracks to be used, hence the early enthusiasm about the potential {{release of the}} record. According to Greenbaum, [...] "The reason River signed with Island in the first place was because he obviously wanted to get his music out to the world. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that happen, even if I never see a penny from it.
