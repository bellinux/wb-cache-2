50|$|Immediately {{after the}} wall was built, the S-Bahn between Oranienburg and Hohen Neuendorf became an <b>isolated</b> <b>operation.</b> Subsequently, S-Bahn tracks were built and {{electrified}} along the Berlin outer ring between Hohen Neuendorf and Blankenburg. This line was connected in November 1961 to the main S-Bahn network. In Berlin, S-Bahn services continued to Frohnau until the handover of operating rights of the S-Bahn in West Berlin from the East German Railways to the BVG on 9 January 1984. Services were first closed and only resumed on 1 October 1984. Rehabilitation carried out on the S-train tracks in 1985 placed them on a track profile {{that would make the}} restoration of the old main line for long distance traffic difficult.|$|E

40|$|Many urban {{tourists}} like {{to visit}} farms, but only some farm landholders offer tourism accommodation and activities. Their motivations have been explored previously in several countries, using stated-preference approaches. Here we report the first continental-scale revealed preference analysis, which yields significant additional information and insights. Using multiple data sources, we inventoried, mapped and characterised all known Australian farm tourism enterprises, and examined patterns using both size-based and multi-criterion classifications. There are clusters of farm tourism enterprises close to cities and gateways, and <b>isolated</b> <b>operations</b> in more remote areas. We identified four groups: full-time, part-time, retirement and lifestyle operators. Characteristics {{of the farm}} property and business, the farming family, and the farm tourism business differ significantly between groups.

40|$|The use of {{induction}} machines as {{electric generator}} with {{renewable energy sources}} is fostered by its simple connection to the power grid, and by its intrinsic safety. In grid <b>isolated</b> <b>operation</b> the induction generator requires a proper excitation. A suitable machine excitation can be achieved relying on a Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CC-VSI) with a proper capacitors bank in the DC side. In this way, higher efficiency, higher control dynamic and a very robust behavior in case of transient variation of the prime mover speed is accomplished. A suitable capacitors bank is still used on the AC side, {{in order to reduce}} the ratings of the CC-VSI and to avoid pre-charging. This paper presents the quantitative design of the CC-VSI and of capacitors bank used for the power management in grid <b>isolated</b> <b>operation.</b> The aim is to achieve the minimum ratings doing to operate the CC-VSI in two quadrants. The quantitative procedure starts from the load requirements that lead to the choice of induction generator. Laboratory experimental results, obtained by an air-gap flux field oriented control, show good behaviors both in transient and in steady state conditions...|$|E

40|$|Non-conventional {{products}} {{provide opportunities}} for the forest industry to increase economic value from forests; however, these products may require transport by specialized vehicles. The existing forest transportation network was not necessarily designed to the road standards required for these specialized vehicles. Several road modifications {{can be made to}} give specialized vehicles access to the forest transportation network including filling the ditch, removing the superelevation, reversing the superelevation, or reconstructing the roadway. For each investment, there is an associated vehicle that can traverse the road segment if the investment is made. For scheduling multiple biomass operations over a road network, we use the Ant Colony heuristic to identify the combination of optimal vehicle choices and road modifications to effectively transport non-conventional products. These combinations related to a 27 % reduction in total transportation costs. For <b>isolated</b> biomass <b>operations,</b> we use breakeven analysis to make the vehicle selection and road modification option. Decisions for <b>isolated</b> biomass <b>operations</b> depend on road modification cost, transport volume, and transport costs on forest and highway roads...|$|R

The key challenge for power grids around the world is or will soon be to accommodate substantial amounts of fluctuating generation from distributed generators. The smart grid concept offers a solution in which the existing grid infrastructure can be used more to its limits. Online feedback from the system gives access to additional reserves resulting from original systematic overdimensioning due to uncertainty of the actual strain.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the world}} our natural {{resources}} {{are becoming increasingly}} difficult to find and excavate, pushing many operations to more remote areas. A consequence of more <b>isolated</b> <b>operations</b> is the high demand for some form of energy to power their facilities. In Nunavut, Canada, a mining company within the Arctic Circle is looking to supplement its diesel fuel needs with wind energy–a relatively inexpensive renewable resource. A mining facility of its capacity requires {{a substantial amount of}} diesel fuel, an expensive asset to transport and store, to operate everything from its mining equipment to its onsite living quarters. Using documented and projected diesel and wind electrical generation capital expenditures and operations and maintenance (OandM) costs, technical data on operating efficiencies, and projected fuel costs, we can assess the potential profitability of wind power supplementation. Through our research, we can project that with a twenty-year operational life of the wind facility, the mine can save $CDN 150 million on energy costs. This project is a stepping-stone in opening the eyes for venture capitalists to invest in companies transitioning to renewable energy sources...|$|R

Due to the intermittent nature of the wind speed, output voltage and frequency of the direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are normally unsteady.

In this paper, {{we consider the}} use of Xen virtualization platform for building software-based virtual routers.

In order to secure the shared data plane, we propose a secure communication protocol that provides mutual authentication, protection against replay attacks, and privacy between the virtual routers and the administrative domain. The results obtained with the developed prototype show that our proposal guarantees availability of the virtual-network control and packet forwarding services and also provides a fair resource sharing.
