40|$|Objectives The {{last two}} years, {{clinical}} cases of tinea capitis caused by Microsporum audouinii (M. audouinii), {{have increased in}} Belgium. To better understand the emergence of this species in the population, the Belgian National Reference Center (NRC) for dermatophytes launched a national survey in 2013. Epidemiological aspects and genotypic characterization of the strains were included. Methods The study was conducted from March 2013 up to February 2014. All Belgian laboratories were asked to send M. audouinii strains isolated from hair to the NRC with a form to fill in including <b>epidemiological</b> <b>informations.</b> The fungal strains were identified by microscopy or ITS sequencing in case of doubt. The genotypic analysis was performed by the DiversiLab® system (bioMérieux) for DNA fingerprinting and analysis. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>informations</b> were analyzed {{with the help of}} a biostatistician. Results Among the collected isolates, 97 strains have been currently confirmed as M. audouinii. Preliminary analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of the infected population shows that the main age category concerns 5 - 9 year-old children (84 %) with a sex-ratio M/F of 1. 95. Data concerning the geographic origin of the family have been obtained in only 45. 8 % of the cases. It reveals that strains have been mainly isolated from patients with a Belgian nationality (77 %) suggesting bias in the data collection. The geographic origin of the remaining group (23 %) includes several African countries. The genotypic analysis led to the distinction of 3 genotypic variants of M. audouinii. One of these variants was exclusively recovered from South Belgium (11 strains). The major group was composed of 85 strains, well distributed in different Belgium locations. The last group contains only one strain but this strain was significantly different from the two other variants. Conclusion The automated typing DiversiLab® system proved to be an easy and efficient method to investigate the molecular epidemiology of dermatophytes infections. These preliminary results show that, through Belgium, several groups of isolates co-exist for M. audouinii providing evidence of genetic heterogeneity. At this time all <b>epidemiological</b> <b>informations</b> have not yet been assessed while 35 strains of M. audouinii remain to be analysed genotypically to give definitive conclusions.

METHODS: Data on basic sanitation and socioeconomic dimensions {{were taken from the}} Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) ] 2010 census. <b>Epidemiological</b> malaria <b>information</b> was taken from the <b>Epidemiological</b> Malaria Surveillance <b>Information</b> System [Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica de Malária (SIVEP/Malaria) ], between 2003 and 2013 of the Ministry of Health and from the SIVEP/Malaria forms of the municipality's Endemic Diseases Unit for 2, 013 cases. RESULTS: Our data do not confirm the correlation among indicators of basic sanitation, socioeconomic conditions, and water supply with malaria cases. Of the 1, 557 cases evaluated, most were caused by Plasmodium vivax, with rare cases of Plasmodium falciparum and mixed infections. There were 756 notifications in 2003. The number of reported cases was sharply reduced between 2006 and 2012, but a 142 -case outbreak occurred in 2013.

The aims {{of this study}} were to determine and identify factors associated to the seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in humans and dogs from Jataizinho, Parana State, Brazil. Serum samples from 280 humans and 766 dogs, from rural and urban areas, were tested by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. Positive dilutions were ≥ 1 : 16. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>informations</b> were obtained through an individual questionnaire and data tabulation was performed using EpiInfo 3. 5. 3 (CDC, Atlanta). Statistical significance was evaluated by chi-square (ᵪ 2) or Fisher’s exact tests with a 5. 0 % significance level. The seroprevalence in humans was 70. 00 % (196 / 280), as follows: 69. 08 % (143 / 207) in rural and 72. 60 % (53 / 73) in a slum urban community.

In rural areas, there was no factor associated to risk of infection. In urban slum community, visualizing more than four rats at home was a factor statistically associated to seropositivity for human toxoplamosis. Infection of urban dogs was associated to age, contact with stray dogs or rodents, and free access to street.

50|$|For {{genotyping}} {{of microorganisms}} for medical diagnosis, or other purposes, scientists may use {{a wide variety}} of DNA profiling techniques, such as PCR, PFGE and MLST. A complication of this broad variety of pre-WGS techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete DNA code of the genome generated by WGS techniques. For straight forward diagnostic identification the WGS information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using BLAST procedures to the genomes already present in the database. In addition, WGS data may be used to back calculate to the different pre-WGS genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost. For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>information</b> such as the global finding place(s), treatment options and antimicrobial resistance, making it a general microbiological identification tool.This makes personalized treatment of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of infectious diseases for food safety and serving human health.|$|E
