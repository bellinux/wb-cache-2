40|$|Three whole-plant sorghum silages, {{each with}} or without 25 % added rolled grain sorghum were fed to six medium-framed, ruminally {{cannulated}} steers in a 6 × 6 Latin square design. The grain sorghum silage rations (DeKalb 42 Y) had the highest DM, OM, and ADF digestibilities; the late-season forage sorghum silage rations (DeKalb FS 25 E), the lowest. Digestibility of NDF tended to be highest for the grain sorghum silage, but starch digestibilities were not affected by sorghum hybrid. Ruminal ammonia, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations were highest for the grain sorghum silage rations. Grain supplementation increased DM and OM digestibilities but {{had no effect on}} NDF, ADF, or starch digestibilities. Ruminal pH was decreased, whereas VFA concentrations were not affected by grain supplementation. The grain sorghum silage had the highest nutritive value, and the middle-season forage sorghum silage (DeKalb FS 5) was superior to the late-season forage sorghum. These results are consistent with several of our previous trials, which compared grain and forage sorghum silages for <b>growing</b> (<b>backgrounding)</b> cattle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Semantic Web {{contributes}} to the elicitation of knowl- edge from data, and leverages implicit knowledge through reasoning al- gorithms. The dynamic aspect of the Web pushes actual batch reasoning solutions, providing the best scalability so far, to upgrade towards incre- mental reasoning. This paradigm enables reasoners to handle new data as they arrive. In this paper we introduce Slider-p, an efficient incre- mental reasoner. It is designed to handle streaming expanding data with a <b>growing</b> <b>background</b> knowledge base. Directed reasoning implemented in Slider-p allows to influence the order of inferred triples. This feature, novel {{in the state of}} the art at the best of our knowledge, enables the adaptation of Slider-p’s behavior to answer at best queries as the rea- soning process is not over. It natively supports ρdf and RDFS, and its architecture allows to extend it to more complex fragments with a min- imal effort. Our experimentations show that it is able to influence the order of the inferred triples, prioritizing the inference of selected kinds of triples...|$|R

30|$|Therefore here we {{will focus}} mostly upon the hedonia or {{pleasure}} aspect of well-being. The pleasure aspect is most tractable, {{and can be}} inspected against a <b>growing</b> <b>background</b> {{of understanding of the}} neural foundations for specific pleasures. Supporting a hedonic approach to happiness, happy people typically feel more pleasure in life. Indeed {{it has been suggested that}} the best and simplest measure of well-being may be to merely ask people how they hedonically feel right now--again and again--so as to track their hedonic accumulation across daily life (Kahneman 1999). Such repeated self-reports of hedonic states could also be used to identify more stable neurobiological hedonic brain traits that dispose particular individuals toward happiness. Conversely, it will probably not be much disputed that the capacity for pleasure is essential to normal well-being. Pathological loss of pleasure can be devastating, and precludes well-being. Our aim is to use findings from recent research on brain mechanisms of pleasure to ask how to higher states of hedonia might be generated to produce well-being, and conversely what might go wrong in affective disorders (Berridge and Kringelbach 2008; Kringelbach and Berridge 2010; Leknes and Tracey 2010; Smith et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Semantic Web {{has gained}} {{substantial}} momentum {{over the last}} decade. It contributes to the manifestation of knowledge from data, and leverages implicit knowledge through reasoning algorithms. The main drawbacks of current reasoning methods over ontologies are twofold: first they struggle to provide scalability for large datasets, and second, the batch processing reasoners who provide the best scalability so far are unable to infer knowledge from evolving data. We contribute to solving these problems by introducing Slider, an efficient incremental reasoner. Slider goes a significant step beyond existing system, including i) performance, {{by more than a}} 70 % improvement in average compared to the fastest reasoner available {{to the best of our}} knowledge, and ii) inferences on streams of semantic data, by using intrinsic features that are themselves streams-oriented. Slider is fragment agnostic and conceived to handle expanding data with a <b>growing</b> <b>background</b> knowledge base. It natively supports ρdf and RDFS, and its architecture allows to extend it to more complex fragments with a minimal effort. In this demo a web-based interface allows the users to visualize the internal behaviour of Slider during the inference, to better understand its design and principles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, Silvers et al. (2009 b), using {{numerical}} simulations, {{confirmed the}} exis-tence {{of a double}} diffusive magnetic buoyancy instability of a layer of horizontal magnetic field produced by the interaction of a shear velocity field with a weak vertical field. Here, we demon-strate the longer term nonlinear evolution of such an instability in the simulations. We find that a quasi two-dimensional interchange instability rides (or “surfs”) on the <b>growing</b> shear-induced <b>background</b> downstream field gradients. The region of activity expands since three-dimensional perturbations remain unstable {{in the wake of}} this upward-moving activity front, and so the three-dimensional nature becomes more noticeable with time...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Beneficial and {{detrimental}} effects of various vegetarian and vegan diets {{on the health}} status are well known. Considering the <b>growing</b> <b>background</b> numbers of vegetarians and vegans, the number of vegetarian and vegan runners is likely to rise, too. Therefore, the Nutrition and Running High Mileage (NURMI) Study {{was designed as a}} comparative study to investigate the prevalence of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans in running events and to detect potential differences in running performance comparing these three subgroups. METHODS/DESIGN: The NURMI Study will be conducted in three steps following a cross-sectional design. Step 1 will determine epidemiological aspects of endurance runners (any distance) using a short standardized questionnaire. Step 2 will investigate dietary habits and running history from eligible participants (capable of running a half-marathon at least) using an extended standardized questionnaire. Step 3 will collect data after a running event on finishing time and final ranking as well as a post-race rating of perceived exertion, mood status, nutrient and fluid intake during the race. DISCUSSION: Our study will provide a major contribution to overcome the lack of data on the prevalence and running performance of vegetarian and vegan runners in endurance running events. We estimate the prevalence of vegetarians and vegans participating in a running event to be less compared to the respective proportion of vegetarians and vegans to the general population. Furthermore we will validate the subject's self-assessment of their respective diet. This comparative study may identify possible effects of dietary behavior on running performance und may detect possible differences between the respective subgroups: omnivorous, vegetarian and vegan runners.
