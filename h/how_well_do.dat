6000|$|I don't {{know whether}} the reader has been as much struck with the above mysterious scene as the writer has; but the fancy of {{it strikes me as}} very fine; and the natural SUPERNATURALNESS is kept up in the best style. The shutter swaying to and fro, the fitful LIGHT APPEARING over the {{furniture}} of the room, and giving it an air of strange motion--the awful shadow which passed through the body of the timid young novice--are surely very finely painted. [...] "I rushed to the shutter, and flung it back: {{there was no one in}} the sacristy. I looked into the garden; it was deserted, and the mid-day wind was roaming among the flowers." [...] The dreariness is wonderfully described: only the poor pale boy looking eagerly out from the window of the sacristy, and the hot mid-day wind walking in the solitary garden. How skilfully is each of these little strokes dashed in, and <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> all together combine to make a picture! But we must have a little more about Spiridion's wonderful visitant.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{the notes}} of the deep-laboring organ burst upon the ear, falling with doubled and redoubled intensity, and rolling, as it were, huge billows of sound. <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> their volume and {{grandeur}} accord with this mighty building! With what pomp do they swell through its vast vaults, and breathe their awful harmony through these caves of death, and make the silent sepulchre vocal! And now they rise in triumphant acclamation, heaving higher and higher their accordant notes and piling sound on sound. And now they pause, and the soft voices of the choir break out into sweet gushes of melody; they soar aloft and warble along the roof, and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the pure airs of heaven. Again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders, compressing air into music, and rolling it forth upon the soul. What long-drawn cadences! What solemn sweeping concords! It grows more and more dense and powerful; it fills the vast pile and seems to jar the very walls--the ear is stunned--the senses are overwhelmed. And now it is winding up in full jubilee--it is rising from the earth to heaven; the very soul seems rapt away and floated upwards on this swelling tide of harmony! ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> the {{franchise}} chains perform? One Wall Street Journal reporting team did an informal assessment by hiring [...] "handymen {{all over the}} country and asked them to fix a wide range of problems, from a relatively routine leaky faucet to a sticky door." [...] The reporter concluded that [...] "with few licensing requirements and standards for the industry, prices are all over the board." [...] One quote was ten times as large as another. Further, the reporter concluded [...] "A big corporate name is no guarantee of quality or speedy service." [...] One corporate firm took three weeks to fix a stuck door. Service varied from spotty to good, with complaints about unreturned phone calls, service people standing on dining room chairs, leaving holes between wood planking, but liked getting multiple jobs done instead of just one. Customers liked handymen wearing hospital booties (to avoid tracking dirt in houses). The reporter chronicled one experience with repairing a water-damaged ceiling. A franchise firm fixed it for $1,530; a second (non-franchise local handyman) fixed a similar ceiling for $125. The reporter preferred the second worker, despite the fact that he [...] "doesn't have a fancy van -- or carry proof of insurance." [...] Tips for selecting a good handyman include: ask questions, get written estimates on company stationery, make sure handymen guarantee their work, pay with credit cards or checks because this provides an additional record of each transaction, check references and licenses, review feedback about the contractors from Internet sites. To find a competent worker, one can seek referrals from local sources such as a school or church or office park, to see if a staff handyman does projects on the side, as well as ask friends for referrals; a general contractor might have workers who do projects on the side as well. Further, one can try out a new handyman with easy projects such as cleaning gutters to see how well they perform.|$|E
