6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Oh, it's all right, Mr. McIlheny. You've {{only got}} {{about half a}} minute." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock, and McIlheny runs out, profusely waving his hand in adieu.|$|E
6000|$|Hâjî Abdû cites Plato and Aristotle, {{as usual}} with Eastern songsters, who delight in Mantik (logic). Here {{he appears to}} mean that a false {{proposition}} is as real a proposition as one that is true. Faith moves mountains and Manet immota fides are evidently quotations. He derides {{the teaching of the}} First Council of the Vatican (cap. v.), all the faithful are little children listening to the voice of Saint Peter, who is the Prince of the Apostles. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fancy of certain modern physicists, devotion is a definite molecular change in the convolution of grey pulp. He notices with contumely the riddle of which Milton speaks so glibly, where the Dialoguists, ...|$|E
60|$|Three weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill {{was at its}} prettiest {{moment in}} all the year,--the great {{chestnuts}} in blossom, and the grass all deep and daisied,--Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the evening, and as he passed over the bridge, he looked with the old deep-rooted affection at the respectable red brick house, which always seemed cheerful and inviting outside, let the rooms be as bare and the hearts as sad as they might inside. There is a very pleasant light in Tom's blue-gray eyes as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house-windows; that fold in his brow never disappears, {{but it is not}} unbecoming; it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness, when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm step becomes quicker, and {{the corners of his mouth}} rebel against the compression which is meant to forbid a smile.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrick {{smiled as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> major’s severe countenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{neat little}} bill {{and took out}} his pocketbook.|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} with some letters. Relocking <b>the</b> door, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> envelopes.|$|R
60|$|It is {{pleasant}} {{to take one}} of these little dingy half-sheets between the thumb and finger, and picture forth the personage who, above ninety years ago, held it, wet from the press, and steaming, before the fire. Many of the numbers bear the name of an old colonial dignitary. There he sits, a major, a member of the council, and a weighty merchant, in his high-backed arm-chair, wearing a solemn wig and grave attire, such as befits his imposing gravity of mien, and displaying but little finery, except a huge pair of silver shoe-buckles, curiously carved. Observe the awful reverence of his visage, as he reads his Majesty's most gracious speech; and the deliberate wisdom with which he ponders over some paragraph of provincial politics, and the keener intelligence with which <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ship-news and commercial advertisements. Observe, and smile! He may have been a wise man in his day; but, to us, the wisdom of the politician appears like folly, because we can compare its prognostics with actual results; and the old merchant seems to have busied himself about vanities, because we know that the expected ships have been lost at sea, or mouldered at the wharves; that his imported broadcloths were long ago worn to tatters, and his cargoes of wine quaffed to the lees; and that the most precious leaves of his ledger have become waste-paper. Yet, his avocations were not so vain as our philosophic moralizing. In this world we are the things of a moment, and are made to pursue momentary things, with here and there a thought that stretches mistily towards eternity, and perhaps may endure as long. All philosophy that would abstract mankind from the present is no more than words.|$|E
60|$|If you {{sit next}} to the {{plausible}} lady at a dinner-table, she takes the earliest opportunity of expressing her belief that you are acquainted with the Clickits; she is sure she has heard the Clickits speak of you--she must not tell you in what terms, or you will take her for a flatterer. You admit {{a knowledge of the}} Clickits; the plausible lady immediately launches out in their praise. She quite loves the Clickits. Were there ever such true- hearted, hospitable, excellent people--such a gentle, interesting little woman as Mrs. Clickit, or such a frank, unaffected creature as Mr. Clickit? were there ever two people, in short, so little spoiled by the world as they are? 'As who, darling?' cries Mr. Widger, from {{the opposite side of the}} table. 'The Clickits, dearest,' replies Mrs. Widger. 'Indeed you are right, darling,' Mr. Widger rejoins; 'the Clickits are a very high-minded, worthy, estimable couple.' Mrs. Widger remarking that Bobtail always grows quite eloquent upon this subject, Mr. Widger admits that he feels very strongly whenever such people as the Clickits and some other friends of his (here <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> host and hostess) are mentioned; for they are an honour to human nature, and do one good to think of. 'YOU know the Clickits, Mrs. Jackson?' he says, addressing the lady of the house. 'No, indeed; we have not that pleasure,' she replies. 'You astonish me!' exclaims Mr. Widger: 'not know the Clickits! why, you are the very people of all others who ought to be their bosom friends. You are kindred beings; you are one and the same thing:- not know the Clickits! Now WILL you know the Clickits? Will you make a point of knowing them? Will you meet them in a friendly way at our house one evening, and be acquainted with them?' Mrs. Jackson will be quite delighted; nothing would give her more pleasure. 'Then, Lavinia, my darling,' says Mr. Widger, 'mind you don't lose sight of that; now, pray take care that Mr. and Mrs. Jackson know the Clickits without loss of time. Such people ought not to be strangers to each other.' Mrs. Widger books both families as the centre of attraction for her next party; and Mr. Widger, going on to expatiate upon the virtues of the Clickits, adds to their other moral qualities, that they keep one of the neatest phaetons in town, and have two thousand a year.|$|E
50|$|The {{occupants}} are humanoid—a man and {{an adolescent}} boy—standing immobile and apparently lifeless. Carter, thinking he sees movement within the cabinet, tries to brush away dust {{for a better}} look. Before his hand touches the glass, he is thrown back by a powerful force-field. As Johnson kneels to check on Carter, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> aliens—and is shocked to see the adult's eyes are open, glaring {{at him with a}} burning intensity.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> watch which <b>he</b> {{had taken}} from his {{waistcoat}} pocket.|$|R
60|$|Aaron frowned {{slightly}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark, self-possessed {{face of the}} little man.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steep face {{of broken}} rock that ran {{down into the}} shadow.|$|R
50|$|John {{drops off}} Regina at the airport. When {{he is about}} to leave the airport, he gets a call from Regina, who tells him that she saw Surya at the {{immigration}} counter. John rushes off to meet Surya and tries to get him to accept Regina. Surya says that he was forced to leave by his father, that he faked his suicide so that Regina would get over him. Surya says that he is now happily married and tells John that one cannot always marry the girl he loves, but should always love the girl he marries. As he leaves, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ring in his hand, which was gifted to him by Regina, showing that Surya will always live with the memories of their relationship.|$|E
5000|$|Joanne {{thought that}} Johnny had {{forgotten}} her birthday {{and goes to}} the Allegro and offers to work. Brock refuses to let her spend her birthday that way and gives her a present. It is a gold pendant with an inscription reading [...] "I am beautiful." [...] he tells her to let it be a reminder to help her stay on her diet. Johnny had indeed forgotten her birthday but is reminded when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> calendar in his office, as he's holding Peg. Johnny races home with a bouquet of carnations and a bracelet for Joanne. She is very happy, and doubly so when he agrees {{to take her to the}} movies. He had also agreed to have lunch with Peg and her father, but is a bit disturbed that the Allegro is the chosen restaurant. Peg and Stuart have already been seated when he arrives, and after a few words with Joanne at the bar, he joins them. Stuart thanks Jack so much for helping Peg.At home that night Joanne says she can understand why Johnny didn't introduce her to his friends at lunch. She's so fat. When he presses her about her eating problem, she confesses to having had an abortion rather than mess up his life with her child she knows he doesn't want. This happened late in their first year of marriage, and since then she's eaten to fill up the awful emptiness inside. Oh hearing this Johnny takes her in his arms and kisses her. It's the first affection he's shown her in ages. He's been showing more affection to Peg however and has not only met her father, but has offered to give Peg a key to his office.|$|E
60|$|Helen showed it. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> initials, {{and laid}} it down with a slight smile.|$|R
60|$|And then, from habit, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{clock in}} the tower, and made further oration.|$|R
60|$|When a pause came, Billy stood up, {{still holding}} her. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fried potatoes.|$|R
60|$|Somewhat irrelevantly <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{next few}} boxes where {{the rest of}} Mrs. Montressor's guests were.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{needed no}} further urging. Whatever Mattie said must {{certainly}} be right. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> book, and {{the bit of}} sky was crimson. But {{still he}} said nothing.|$|R
60|$|John {{took up his}} hat and gloves. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock--it was {{a little}} past eleven.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe frowned <b>at</b> me. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{young lady}} as though seeking for some explanation.|$|R
60|$|The doctor's eyes sparkled as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gold {{which his}} visitor had laid upon the table.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Captain Putnam had come in. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead snake {{and gave a}} start.|$|R
60|$|Granet was {{thoughtful}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little {{clock on}} the dashboard opposite to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cut on Gerald's forehead, {{noted the}} access of colour in his cheeks, and nodded.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a knock}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door. The ship's doctor entered. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little {{company and}} hesitated.|$|R
60|$|After a while <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little {{clock that}} was ticking on the mantelpiece. It was half-past twelve.|$|R
60|$|The Chinaman {{shook his}} head. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{slip of paper}} indifferently and went on with his work.|$|R
60|$|A sort of pleased yet half-cynical smile {{crossed the}} grave visage of Quentin Dick as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> youth.|$|R
60|$|Sadie {{wrote the}} receipt and {{he noted that}} her hand shook. As she got up <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quirt.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{title and}} shrugged his {{shoulders}} slightly. There were indications of a frown upon his fine forehead.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{hour later}} when Grant and several {{horsemen}} arrived, and he nodded as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prisoner.|$|R
60|$|Dale hesitated, {{with his}} hand on <b>the</b> door. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd, now edging close again, and then at Helen.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Jimmy {{advisable}} {{to change the}} subject, {{and he made a}} little grimace as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plate.|$|R
60|$|In {{response}} to his inquiry, the cashier told him when the morning train started for San Francisco. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock.|$|R
