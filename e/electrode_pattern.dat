40|$|Electrode {{design is}} {{investigated}} for electrical capacitance tomography on a 1 mm-thick 3 D planar domain. Arrays of square electrodes {{are located on}} both sides of the domain, which is filled with dielectric material. Anomalies of interest are voids in the material with low dielectric constant. Simulated tomography is conducted with various <b>electrode</b> <b>patterns</b> over a range of electrode sizes in order to compare performance. The high-aspect-ratio domain requires a large finite element mesh for simulating electric fields and for defining spatial sensitivity responses of electrode pairs.

40|$|Objective: A {{model is}} {{presented}} to evaluate the viability of using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with a nerve cuff to record neural activity in peripheral nerves. Approach: Established modelling approaches in neural-EIT are expanded on to be used, for the first time, on myelinated fibres which are abundant in mammalian peripheral nerves and transmit motor commands.
