25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the <b>enrolment</b> <b>process</b> and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E

40|$|The higher {{education}} sector in Hong Kong has restructured substantially from elite to mass {{higher education}} since the introduction of education reform by the Hong Kong government in 2000. To stay ahead in this competitive environment in the education sector, management teams of self-financing institutions have to compete for students and identify key factors influencing students’ choice of post-secondary programmes. This paper investigates factors affecting students’ choice of sub-degree programmes in self-financing higher education institutions in Hong Kong. Importance–performance analysis was employed as an analytical tool to help institutions identify areas for improvement and utilize their resources more effectively. The findings show that institutions should find ways to improve areas of “articulation”, “career services”, “financial aid” and “programme design” {{in order to increase}} their competitiveness. The outcomes of this research will help management teams of self-financing higher education institutions enhance their overall strategic plan and <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes</b> in order to attract students in a context of increasing competition for students in the Hong Kong higher education system.

40|$|This report {{recommends}} that the Commonwealth adopts {{a system of}} automatic enrolment of voters similar to the proposed New South Wales system. Declining electoral enrolment continues to present a significant challenge not only for Australia, but for many countries and jurisdictions. Existing paper-based enrolment requirements under Commonwealth legislation are a deterrent to {{the current generation of}} Australians who are accustomed to conducting business with government agencies through electronic transactions. The introduction of flexible approaches which modernise electoral <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes</b> is a vital component for addressing the challenge of declining enrolment. The New South Wales Parliament has taken legislative action to address concerns over declining enrolment levels by introducing a new automatic enrolment system for state and local government elections. NSW will no longer rely on the Australian Electoral Commission to prepare and maintain rolls for NSW elections. Under the NSW legislation, the NSW Electoral Commissioner will assume responsibility for preparing and maintaining a roll for each NSW electoral district using enrolment data supplied by the Commonwealth and data held by various NSW government agencies. The NSW legislation could have significant implications for the conduct of federal elections if Commonwealth legislation is not amended to allow for similar provisions. Having two different enrolment regimes operating at the Commonwealth and State level creates the potential for elector confusion. Of particular concern is the scenario whereby voters in NSW are enrolled automatically for that state’s elections and mistakenly believe that they have also been enrolled for the purpose of federal elections. If granted the power to implement similar automatic enrolment measures, the AEC has acknowledged that it would proceed with caution and conservatism, and would apply carefully designed business rules to ensure the integrity of the electoral roll is maintained. The committee supports Commonwealth legislation being amended to allow the AEC to automatically enrol electors on the basis of data provided by trusted agencies.  To ensure that automatic enrolment does not inadvertently limit the ability for eligible electors to exercise the franchise, election day enrolment is proposed as a safety net to capture those electors who have not been picked up through automatic <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes,</b> {{as well as those who}} have been removed from the electoral roll in error or enrolled at the wrong address.

40|$|The {{first year}} {{experience}} (FYE) is both exciting and daunting for university students. Ensuring that this experience is positive and enjoyable is increasingly important for universities, with research indicating that students’ initial experiences {{will determine whether}} they complete their degree (McInnes, James and Hartley 2000). This paper analyses student responses to one open-ended question in a survey that considered students’ initial experiences of university at the Carseldine and Caboolture Campuses of Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in 2005. The question was How could QUT and the campus improve your experience as a first-year student? Please describe {{both positive and negative}} aspects of your experience. The responses were classified into five categories: Enrolment/Orientation Issues, Socio-cultural Issues, Academic Support, Access to Information and General Comments. Some students did not comment (n= 109) but those that did respond (n= 155) identified some key challenges and possible solutions. These included: the provision of social activities for first year students, the need for improved clarity in <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes,</b> and more information and pre-commencement sessions on course structures/requirements/choices and career pathways. Two major implications for the initial phases of first year can be discerned from the challenges identified by the students. Firstly, improvements are required in orientation/induction programs and, secondly, the information provided to students, as well as the means for accessing that information, need to be clear and consistent...|$|R

Although each house is put under the authority a group of teachers, it is also governed by their own student body with the Head of the House usually a member of the School Prefects Board.

50|$|Complex {{services}} involve {{many steps}} and may require paperwork or customer files to be shuffled between contact staff, back office and support departments. The time taken to move paperwork or customers is very costly {{in terms of}} time and efficiency. Tertiary student enrolment provides a great example of complex processes that are often not very customer-friendly. Students must firstly see an academic advisor to ensure that their course progress in on track, then see an administrative advisor to check that paperwork is in order and finally see a cashier to pay tuition fees and pay any fines, such as overdue library books before they can finalise their enrolment. In many institutions, this <b>enrolment</b> <b>process</b> can take half a day - and requires students to run from pillar to post as they complete each step. Locating each stage in close proximity has many advantages. Not only does it improve operational efficiency, {{it has the potential to}} allow service staff to focus on the total process and gain a better understanding of the ways that their actions impact on other parts of the system. In short, it forces employees to focus not just on the activities for which they are directly responsible.|$|E

40|$|Background Pandemics {{of new and}} {{emerging}} infectious diseases are unpredictable, recurrent events that rapidly threaten global health and security. We aimed to identify public views regarding provision of information and consent to participate in primary and critical care clinical research during a future influenza-like illness pandemic. Methods Descriptive-interpretive qualitative study, using focus groups (n = 10) and semi-structured interviews (n = 16), with 80 {{members of the public}} (> 18 years) in Belgium, Spain, Poland and the UK. Local qualitative researchers followed a scenario-based topic guide to collect data. Data were transcribed verbatim, translated into English and subject to framework analysis. Results Public understandings of pandemics were shaped by personal factors (illness during the previous H 1 N 1 pandemic, experience of life-threatening illness) and social factors (historical references, media, public health information). Informants appreciated safeguards provided by ethically robust research procedures, but current enrolment procedures were seen as a barrier. They proposed simplified <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes</b> for higher risk research and consent waiver for certain types of low-risk research. Decision making about research participation was influenced by contextual, research and personal factors. Informants generally either carefully weighed up various approaches to research participation or responded instinctively. They supported the principle of using routinely collected, anonymized clinical biological samples for research without explicit consent, but regarded this as less acceptable if researchers were motivated primarily by commercial gain. Conclusions This bottom-up approach to ascertaining public views on pandemic clinical research has identified support for more proportionate research protection procedures for publically funded, low-risk studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Children {{with disabilities}} are {{frequently}} discriminated against in Australian schools. It 2 ̆ 7 s {{an issue that has}} been ongoing for years, with reports showing that little has improved since 2002. Exclusion practices - dubbed as 2 ̆ 2 gatekeeping 2 ̆ 2 - include advising parents to send their child to another school that could better support them; only allowing a child to attend a school on the days that funding is available; and asking parents to pay extra money so the school can employ support staff or purchase equipment. Although this happens across all school types, it tends to be more prominent in, and easier for, non-government or private schools. As these schools compete for enrolments and top exam results, there is a disincentive for them to take any risk that might dilute those results. Unlike public schools, private schools are not required to run open <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes.</b> Their charter is to provide schooling of 2 ̆ 2 choice 2 ̆ 2, not to provide for everyone. Because of this, the exact size of the gatekeeping problem is unknown. While government schools receive some extra funding from the state to support children with learning difficulties and disabilities, private schools aren 2 ̆ 7 t entitled to this. This has led to the over-representation of students with a disability in government schools, particularly those in disadvantaged areas where parents have fewer options. Over time this leads to a significant burden within some schools, adding to teacher stress and negatively affecting their wellbeing. The concentration of students with additional support needs also impacts other students. The less diversity there is within schools, the less opportunity there is for students to learn from one another. This is the case for abled and disabled students alike...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the major {{influences}} shaping the careers of Mainland Chinese school principals. In so doing, it further seeks to explore the part played by the PRC’s societal culture {{in the process of}} career shaping, and to explore whether stages are recognisable by which their careers can be framed. The study is directed by two main research questions: First, what factors influence the careers of primary and secondary school principals in the PRC? Second, can their careers be conceptualised into stages? Methodologically, the study adopts an interpretivist paradigm and a qualitative approach, using the social theory of symbolic interactionism to underpin its assumptions. Life-history data in relation to their careers were collected from eleven middle and four primary school PRC school principals through semi-structured interviews. Participant principals were {{selected on the basis of}} purposive sampling. Coding of the data was followed by categorisation of the generated codes into career-influencing themes. Four main career-influencing themes emerged from the data. The first is Family Background, especially aspects of family socio-economic standing, and familial environment and expectations with regard to education. The second is Political Dimension - with the sub-themes of politically-driven contexts, Party-membership, subservience towards Party dictates, and a strong presence of a politically charged environment. The third is Significant Strategies/Means/Competencies with the sub-themes of Guanxi, qualifications (academic and professional); Nengli (teaching-cum-managing competency), and harmonious working relationships with others. The fourth is Circumstances, with the aspect of institutional <b>enrolment</b> <b>processes,</b> and a combination of factors that include a proclivity for book learning, timely opportunities and limited options, as its subthemes. The role of the PRC’s societal culture as mediated by the above themes and their effects on the careers of the respondents were identified using the dimensions in Walker and Dimmock’s framework for gauging the impact of societal culture on school management. Finally, a model of the influences on the careers of PRC school principals, and three frameworks on their career-stages were generated from the data.
