This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E

The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is currently being rebuilt with <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance</b> and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.|$|E

5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance</b> by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|The Philippine Football Association {{partnered with}} San Miguel Brewery to seek <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance</b> in {{developing}} football in the country. In the early sixties, British coaches Alan Rogers and Brian Birch {{were brought in}} and funded by San Miguel to train referees, coaches and players in the country. Due to lack of facilities, the two coaches organized a five-a-side football competition which was played in a field with the same size of a basketball court. The two were later relieved and Danny McClellan and Graham Adams were tasked train national and youth players.|$|E
5|$|The FNLC invaded Shaba {{again on}} 11 May 1978, {{capturing}} Kolwezi in two days. While the Carter Administration had accepted Cuba's insistence on its non-involvement in Shaba I, and therefore did not stand with Mobutu, the U.S. government now accused Castro of complicity. This time, when Mobutu appealed for <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance,</b> the U.S. government {{worked with the}} French and Belgian militaries to beat back the invasion, the first military cooperation between France and the United States since the Vietnam War. The French Foreign Legion took back Kolwezi after a seven-day battle and airlifted 2,250 European citizens to Belgium, but not before the FNLC massacred 80 Europeans and 200 Africans. In one instance, the FNLC killed 34 European civilians who had hidden in a room. The FNLC retreated to Zambia, vowing to return to Angola. The Zairean army then forcibly evicted civilians along Shaba's border with Angola. Mobutu, wanting to prevent any chance of another invasion, ordered his troops to shoot on sight.|$|E

5|$|As an American, and {{therefore}} a citizen of a neutral country, Heineman used his contacts abroad to find overseas sources of food which might be shipped to Belgium to resupply the populace. Food from abroad being the only viable immediate solution to Belgium's food shortage, the Committee's chief initial difficulty was obtaining {{the permission of the}} British and German governments to import food and in providing guarantees {{that it would not be}} used for military purposes. The CNSA was also supported in its early activities by Charles de Broqueville's Belgian government in exile. The logistical problems involved in coordinating the huge shipments of food to Belgium meant that the CNSA began to look for <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance</b> in procuring and transporting material to Belgium. Francqui used his personal acquaintance with Herbert Hoover, future President of the United States, to create an external body to assist the management of the CNSA. Hoover became the director of the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB), and led successful attempts to raise money abroad in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Belgium. Because the CRB was officially an American organization, the CRB was also necessary to assure that the food, once delivered to the CNSA, was not immediately seized by the Germans. The CRB also provided the international support necessary to convince the British government to permit the shipments. Once received, the food and material from the CRB was distributed through the CNSA's network of 125,000 agents across the country.|$|E

25|$|Summing up the {{experience}} of African countries both at the national and at the regional levels it is no exaggeration to suggest that, on balance, <b>foreign</b> <b>assistance,</b> especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development.
