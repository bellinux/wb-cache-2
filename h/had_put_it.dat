5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E

While Tarzan teaches Zutho and his friends how to make spears, a fire broke out and nearly destroyed the jungle but the rain <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down. Tarzan blamed himself {{and ended up in}} Zutho's debt. Years later, Zutho resurfaces in order to get Tarzan to fulfill his favor into dealing with some annoying monkeys that were keeping him up at night. With help from Jane, Terk, and Tantor, Tarzan did the right thing and admitted what happened the day of the fire to Kala who then dealt with Zutho.|$|E

500|$|The 1991 {{arrest was}} widely covered, and Reubens and his {{character}} both became {{the subject of}} ridicule. Disney-MGM Studios suspended a video that showed Pee-wee explaining how voice-over tracks were made from its studio tour. Toys [...] "R" [...] Us removed Pee-wee toys from its stores. It was commonly thought that Pee-wee's Playhouse got cancelled due to the arrest; in actuality the show was already retired as Reubens, claiming an overworked crew and fear of decline of quantity and quality in material, had decided against a sixth season. However, the popularity of the show <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into syndication, which CBS revoked in fall of 1991. Reubens released a statement denying the charges.|$|E
500|$|Fred Sullivan was the {{prototype}} for the [...] "patter" [...] (comic) baritone {{roles in the}} later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he [...] "was {{one of the most}} naturally comic little men I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest...." [...] Fred's creation would {{serve as a model for}} the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial comic little man role, as Burnand <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> The [...] "patter" [...] baritone (or [...] "principal comedian", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.|$|E

500|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the start of the 2011–12 season, Samuelsson played six games for Vancouver before being traded away on October 22, 2011. He was sent back to Florida for his second stint with the Panthers, along with fellow veteran forward Marco Sturm, in {{exchange}} for forwards David Booth and Steven Reinprecht, as well as a third-round draft pick in 2013. In an interview with HockeySverige.se at the end of the season, he told Swedish reporters that while he enjoyed playing in Vancouver, competing alongside countrymen Alexander Edler and the Sedins in particular, he [...] "didn't think very highly of management." [...] He also criticized Alexandre Burrows for his actions during the Finals, when he bit Patrice Bergeron's finger after the Bruins forward <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in his mouth, citing it a rallying point for the Bruins in their defeat of the Canucks.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} episode, the Eleventh Doctor still wears his {{previous}} incarnation's costume, but costume designer Ray Holman {{stated that the}} costume was broken down and distressed. Over {{the course of the}} first episode, he would find his own identity and pick out his defining costume. Smith tried {{on a wide variety of}} things to find a look he would feel comfortable and confident in and would identify his Doctor. Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94% for the month of April 2010, connected to when the series began airing.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Sherlock realises [...] "hound" [...] {{may be an}} acronym rather than a word. The pair run into DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) who was sent by Mycroft {{to keep an eye}} on Sherlock. They {{interrogate}} the innkeepers about a past order for meat that John has spotted, which struck him as odd for a vegetarian restaurant. The innkeepers kept a dog on the moor to boost the tourist trade, but assure the investigators they <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down. This explanation satisfies Lestrade but not Sherlock, who insists the dog he saw was monstrous. Calling Mycroft, Sherlock gains access to Baskerville again. Searching the lower levels of the genetics labs, John finds himself trapped and then hears growling which he assumes is the hound. Locking himself in an empty cage, he calls Sherlock, who rescues him. Sherlock deduces a chemical weapon designed to trigger violent hallucinations was responsible. Retreating into his [...] "mind palace", a memory technique, Sherlock realises [...] "Liberty" [...] and [...] "In" [...] stands for Liberty, Indiana. After viewing confidential files, he sees [...] "H.O.U.N.D." [...] was a secret C.I.A. project aimed at creating a hallucinatory anti-personnel chemical weapon, but the project was abandoned several years before. Sherlock realises Frankland, who participated in the project, has continued it in secret.|$|E

500|$|Already by 1940, Mutual {{was on a}} {{par with}} the {{industry}} leaders in terms of affiliate roster size. Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenue—NBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year. In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company [...] "has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets." [...] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its parent company, RCA, alleging a conspiracy [...] "hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nationwide network programs." [...] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit. These developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to Mutual—the transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States. But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350. It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained [...] "less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage," [...] as the Supreme Court <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. Mutual needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.|$|E

[...] In Byrd and other recent cases, the court had affirmed [...] "a strong national policy favoring arbitration," [...] as it <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., and he saw no reason to stop here. However, when challenged on how the Court could reach his desired result without overruling American Safety and thus avoid the question of whether purely domestic antitrust claims were arbitrable, he pointed the justices to Scherk. [...] "I did not read ... as overruling Wilko so much as a limitation on Wilko in international conduct." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1874 was a busy {{year for}} both Gilbert and Cellier. Gilbert {{illustrated}} The Piccadilly Annual; supervised {{a revival of}} Pygmalion and Galatea; and, in addition to Topsyturveydom, wrote Charity, about the redemption of a fallen woman; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, a parody of Hamlet; a dramatisation of Ought We to Visit Her? (a novel by Annie Edwardes), an adaptation from the French, Committed for Trial, another adaptation from the French called The Blue-Legged Lady; and a play, Sweethearts. He also wrote a Bab-illustrated story called [...] "The Story of a Twelfth Cake" [...] for the Graphic Christmas number.

[...] Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained {{that he had made}} Fagin Jewish because [...] "it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew". Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish faith, saying in a letter, [...] "I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one. I always speak well of them, whether in public or private, and bear my testimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as I have ever had with them". Eliza Davis, whose husband had purchased Dickens's home in 1860 when he <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up for sale, wrote to Dickens in June 1863 urging that [...] "Charles Dickens the large hearted, whose works please so eloquently and so nobly for the oppressed of his country ... has encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew."

Replying, Mrs. Davis asked Dickens to [...] "examine more closely into the manners and character of the British Jews and to represent them as they really are." ...|$|E
