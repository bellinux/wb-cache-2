500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater</b> and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of {{four and}} called it [...] "an {{astonishing}} achievement in imaginative filmmaking" [...] and said [...] "Lucas tells a good story." [...] Ebert also wrote that [...] "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" [...] {{because it is the}} opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than Star Trek films, filmmakers could [...] "ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a [...] "C-", calling it [...] "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile". ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote:Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom Menace is still among the best [...] "bang for a buck" [...] fun that can be had <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater.</b> It isn't as fresh as the original Star Wars nor does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of the Jedi. In fact, after Return of the Jedi, I didn't have a burning desire to return to this galaxy 'far, far away', but, with The Phantom Menace, Lucas has revived my interest. Now, it's with genuine regret that I realize the next segment of the series is three long years away.|$|E

2500|$|Danny Rubin had {{completed}} and sold his script for Hear No Evil and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles {{to become a}} professional screenwriter around 1990. His agent suggested that he prepare a [...] "calling-card" [...] script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers. He {{came up with the}} core idea of the script which would become Groundhog Day while sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>theater.</b> He had asked himself the question [...] "If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?" [...] Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif had found its [...] "deeper purpose" [...] within the new script. The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.|$|E
