40|$|A typical {{continuous}} web-processing machine {{consists of}} hundreds of idle rollers and web spans. A web span is formed by tensioning a thin film (the web) over at least two idle rollers. Machine drive controls, bearing friction, and air impingement on the web surface represent some {{of the factors that}} can influence web tension and web speed. A significant effort is devoted to maintaining uniform web tension and web speed in these machines. The uniformity of these parameters is a requirement to consistently manufacture web products within rigorous quality specifications. In support of this effort to control web tension and web speed, reports have been published to investigate the vibration response of the web-idle roller system. The machine is modeled as a multidegree-of-freedom system consisting of numerous springs and masses connected in series. The equivalent spring and mass elements are represented by the web span and roller inertia respectively. The scope of this investigation is limited to the analysis of the axial vibration of a single web span and <b>idle</b> <b>roller</b> interface. The two main objectives of this work are to characterize the axial vibration response of a single web span and numerically determine axial displacements of the web. A correlation is made between the axial displacement (less than 0. 05 inch) of the web relative to the surface of an <b>idle</b> <b>roller</b> and small scratches (0. 005 - 0. 010 inch long) formed {{on the surface of the}} web. The web is assumed to be an elastic member subject to tensile forces only. The one-dimensional wave equation is shown to be the governing equation of motion for the web-idle roller system. Boundary conditions are developed to accommodate the web-idle roller interface at one end of the web and the input tension force at the opposite end. A simplifying assumption of the model is that the average web speed is zero. The effect of zero average web speed is assumed to be small because the wave speed is nearly 1000 times greater than the typical average web conveyance speed of 250 feet per minute. Three solution methods have been presented for the wave equation (Separation of Variables, Laplace Transform combined with Inverse Fast Fourier Transform, and Galerkin Finite Element). The Finite Element method, written in a spreadsheet software format, was found to be the best method of solution for this partial differential equation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a novel Passive Variable Stiffness Joint (pVSJ). pVSJ is the proof of concept of a passive revolute joint with controllable variable stiffness. The current design {{is intended to be}} a bench-test for future development towards applications in haptic teleoperation purposed exoskeletons. The main feature of the pVSJ is its capability of varying the stiffness with infinite range based on a simple mechanical system. Moreover, the joint can rotate freely at the zero stiffness case without any limitation. The stiffness varying mechanism consists of two torsional springs, mounted with an offset from the pVSJ rotation center and coupled with the joint shaft by an <b>idle</b> <b>roller.</b> The position of the roller between the pVSJ rotation center and the spring's center is controlled by a linear sliding actuator fitted on the chassis of the joint. The variation of the output stiffness is obtained by changing the distance from the roller-springs contact point to the joint rotation center (effective arm). If this effective arm is null, the stiffness of the joint will be zero. The stiffness increases to reach high stiffness values when the effective arm approaches its maximum value, bringing the roller close to the torsional springs' center. The experimental results matched with the physical-based modeling of the pVSJ in terms of stiffness variation curve, stiffness dependency upon the springs' elasticity, joint deflection and the spring's deflection...|$|E
3000|$|Typically, the {{coefficient}} of friction b is small and can be ignored. Therefore, in the steady-state process, the <b>idle</b> <b>rollers</b> will {{not contribute to the}} dynamic of the system, which indicates that [...] T_i + 1 = T_i [...].|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{considered}} the dynamics of driven rollers in the models but the behavior of <b>idle</b> <b>rollers</b> was ignored. Consequently, the models were under some limited conditions, which ignored detailed complex tension dynamics. On the other hand, most research focused on dynamic modeling and control strategy design, but the mechanical structure {{and the influence of}} parameter variation on fiber tension were ignored. In this paper, a novel tension control method is presented, which can regulate the tension and speed of the filament winding process. The mechanical structure and dynamic model of the system are established, and the influences of the parameter and the speed variation on fiber tension are examined. Subsequently, according to the features of driven rollers and the influence of variation, the control method is proposed by regulating the outputs of the torque of unwind roll, the torque of magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller in three levels. Simulations are conducted for verifying the effect by comparing the results with those of the conventional PID controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed control system is verified through experimental studies using a filament winding machine.|$|R
3000|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  21, {{the number of}} <b>idle</b> <b>rollers</b> {{influences}} both the settling time and the overshooting value of the tension. In Figure  21 (a), the overshooting value is 2.8  N when N[*]=[*] 21, which {{is greater than the}} values 2  N and 2.1  N when N[*]=[*] 14 and N[*]=[*] 17, respectively, and the settling time is slower. In the three cases, the errors e(k) are in the interval [−[*] 2.8, − 2] and the linguistic labels are NM and NS. Consequently, the outputs Δ K_p (k) [...] and Δ K_i (k) [...] of the fuzzy control are almost the same, and it requires more time to reach the equilibrium position in the case N[*]=[*] 21. In Figure  21 (b), the overshooting value is 4.6  N when N[*]=[*] 21, which is greater than the value 3.0  N and 2.8  N when N[*]=[*] 14 and N[*]=[*] 17; however, the settling time is faster. The peak error e(k) is − 4.6  N, and the linguistic labels are NB and NM in the case of N[*]=[*] 21. Compared to the error linguistic labels NM and NS, the outputs Δ K_p (k) [...] and Δ K_i (k) [...] of the fuzzy control are larger, and it requires less time to return to the equilibrium position.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFlexible {{materials}} such as textiles, papers, polymers, and metals are transported on rollers during their processing. Maintaining web tension in the entire processing line under changing web speed is {{a key factor in}} achieving good final product quality. Many industrial applications use dancer position feedback to indirectly regulate tension. Although widely used in the industry, pendulum dancers (rotational motion of the dancer roller) have received very little attention in the literature compared to linear ones (translational motion). The lack of clearly identified controllers synthesis methods can thus be noticed, as industry typically uses hand-tuned decentralized PI controllers. An improved alternative based on methods is proposed in this paper to provide a systematic framework. The focus in this study is the unwind section of a processing line that contains a pendulum dancer (PD). The nonlinear and linear phenomenological models of the unwind section containing the PD are discussed first. The position controller based on dancer position feedback is synthesized using the standard approach with mixed sensitivity. Because of the high order of the controllers synthesized with this approach, techniques to generate reduced-order controllers are used to calculate a fixed-order controller resembling standard industrial practice. The performance of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by carrying out experiments on a large experimental web handling platform containing four driven <b>rollers,</b> many <b>idle</b> <b>rollers,</b> and a PD in the unwind section. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first published results of successful application of an controller to a real plant containing a PD...|$|R
30|$|Filament winding {{has emerged}} as the main process for carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) fabrication, and tension control {{plays a key role in}} enhancing the quality of the winding products. With the continuous improvement of product quality and efficiency, the precision of the tension control system is constantly improving. In this paper, a novel tension control method is proposed, which can regulate the fiber tension and transport speed of the winding process by governing the outputs of three different driven rollers (the torque of the unwind roll, the torque of the magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller) in three levels. The mechanical structures and dynamic models of the driven <b>rollers</b> and <b>idle</b> <b>rollers</b> are established by considering the time-varying features of the roller radius and inertia. Moreover, the influence of parameters and speed variation on fiber tension is investigated using the increment model. Subsequently, the control method is proposed by applying fiber tension in three levels according to the features of the three driven rollers. An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for tuning the PID parameters online to control the speed of the master speed roller. Simulation is conducted for verifying the performance and stability of the proposed tension control method by comparing with those of the conventional PID control method. The result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed, and the proposed system is applied to a winding machine. The performance and stability of the tension control system are demonstrated via a series of experiments using carbon fiber under different reference speeds and tensions. This paper proposes a novel tension control method to regulate the fiber tension and transport speed.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the roll wear in the multi-strand rolling of reinforced concrete ribbed bars {{has been made in}} the study. In the technology under consideration, the longitudinal partition of the band takes place in special slitting passes, while the separation of individual strands – in <b>idle</b> separating <b>rollers.</b> During rolling, the slitting passes undergo fast wear compared to the remaining passes of the rolling line. The paper reports the results of theoretical and experimental examinations, on the basis of which the wear of the slitting passes in the 16 mm-diameter ribbed bar three-strand rolling process has been determined. The theoretical examination was done using the Forge 2011 ® software program, while experimental tests were carried out in a D 350 medium-size continuous rolling mill. Based on the {{analysis of}} the investigation results, the wear coefficient was established for the slitting passes, which allowed the determination of their quantitative wear...|$|R
