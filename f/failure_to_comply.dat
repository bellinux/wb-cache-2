5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

While in their spaceship, she is met by De Vries, who has also been imprisoned due to her <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with the deal.

40|$|Property {{owners who}} make {{charitable}} gifts of perpetual conservation easements {{are eligible to}} claim federal charitable income tax deductions. Through this tax-incentive program the public is investing {{billions of dollars in}} easements encumbering millions of acres nationwide. In response to reports of abuse in the early 2000 s, the Internal Revenue Service (Service) began auditing and litigating questionable easement donation transactions, and the resulting case law reveals significant <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with the deduction’s requirements. Recently, the Service has come under fire for enforcing the deduction’s “perpetuity” requirements, which are intended to ensure that the easements will protect the subject properties’ conservation values in perpetuity and that the public’s investment in the easements will not be lost. Critics claim that the agency is improperly discouraging easement donations by denying deductions for technical foot faults, and some have called for a change to the law that would allow taxpayers <b>to</b> cure their <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with the perpetuity requirements if they are discovered on audit. This Article illustrates that noncompliance with the perpetuity requirements should not be viewed as technical foot faults. To the contrary, compliance is essential to the integrity of the tax-incentive program and the easements subsidized through the program. In addition, allowing taxpayers <b>to</b> cure <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with the perpetuity requirements if they are discovered on audit would significantly increase noncompliance and abuse and, given the reliance nationwide on deductible easements to accomplish conservation goals, risk fatally undermining an entire generation of conservation efforts. This Article recommends a more prudent approach: the Treasury’s issuance of guidance that would greatly facilitate compliance with the perpetuity requirements, reduce transaction costs for taxpayers, and significantly shore up the integrity of the program...|$|R

We address this question by examining the linkages between decision making on European Union directives and any subsequent infringements and delays in national transposition.

This is compared with state-based explanations that focus on country-specific characteristics. Infringements are more likely when states disagree with the content of directives and the directives provide them with little discretion. Granting discretion to member states, however, tends to lead to longer delays in transposition. We find no evidence of country-specific effect...|$|R

Hungry Jack's argued that this meant Burger King would not have a right to terminate until the grace period expired, or else it would lose its opportunity to remedy the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply.</b> Burger King argued that clause 15.1(d) — which allowed it to terminate the agreement if any of the conditions were breached — was worded broadly enough that any breach would activate it, and that clause 8.1 only operated if it chose not to terminate the agreement.|$|E
