5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. <b>Her</b> <b>argument</b> was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

25|$|With {{the power}} of her first public {{appearance}} as a woman's rights advocate, Woodhull moved to the leadership circle of the suffrage movement. Although her Constitutional argument was not original, she focused unprecedented public attention on suffrage. Woodhull {{was the first woman}} ever to petition Congress in person.

Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper printed a full-page engraving of Woodhull, surrounded by prominent suffragists, delivering <b>her</b> <b>argument.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to community cooperation and coordination, Fitzpatrick {{shows that the}} incorporation of open standards and built-in extensibility are crucial {{to the development of}} successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text markup, so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich metadata, so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including TEI, DOI, and LOCKSS) and shows that each is based {{in the creation of a}} community organization that values openness and extensibility.|$|E

25|$|The case, {{begun by}} the Australian Council of Trade Unions and {{supported}} by the Whitlam government, extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969. Prior decisions had guaranteed equal pay only for certain specific occupations and later, certain limited industries (industries traditionally considered 'women's work', such as the textile industry), whereas this case extended the principle of equal pay to all workers. Gaudron's argument was based on the principles of the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention of the International Labour Organization (an organisation she would later work for). However, Gaudron later came to regard <b>her</b> <b>argument,</b> that Australia had not ratified the Convention because the Commission would not grant equal pay (thus preventing Australia from fulfilling its obligations under the Convention), as somewhat disingenuous, and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment.|$|E
25|$|The modern Strait of Sicily {{separates}} Tunisia and Sicily by 145km, but is {{shallow and}} would have been much narrower in glacial maxima. We have a poor understanding of plate tectonics of this area for the greater part of the Pleistocene. But while plate tectonics could have made the strait narrower than predicted by the lowering of sea levels alone, contrast of Pleistocene fauna strongly argues against an actual land bridge. Since the strait is only 400km away from the North African hominin site of Ain Hanech in Algeria (1.8 Ma or 1.2 Ma) it remains a plausible route for Early Pleistocene expansion into Eurasia. But there is close to no evidence for a hominin passage. Alimen based most of <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> in favour of such a migration on Bianchini's discovery of Sicilian Oldowan grade tools. Radiometric dates, however, have not been produced, and the artefacts might as well be from the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E

500|$|Greenwood's {{text was}} {{reviewed}} by Patric V. Giesler of Gustavus Adolphus College for peer-reviewed academic journal American Ethnologist. Giesler describes Greenwood's work as [...] "provocative", noting {{that it represents}} a [...] "native's account" [...] of Paganism, with Greenwood being [...] "a native gone anthropologist." [...] He characterises Greenwood's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical, because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end; the classic definition of magic. Unconvinced by <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> that practitioner's notions of identity, gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld, he considers other sources for such notions, but otherwise recommended the book.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing about}} this horrific event, Chang strives to portray {{it as an}} unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she {{undermines}} her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) {{at that time and}} uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck me about <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to accept the fact of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal {{to come to terms with}} its past.' ...|$|E

500|$|Eunice Chua argues against {{adopting}} the subjective test and limiting judicial review to breaches {{of the procedures}} stated in the ISA. <b>Her</b> <b>argument</b> {{is based on the}} premise that courts should consider notions of substantive democracy in performing their judicial role. Chua argues that in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal should have considered whether there were sufficient safeguards for the protection of detainees after the curtailment of judicial review through constitutional and legislative amendments. She suggests that Article151, which provides for restrictions on preventive detention, should be read liberally in favour of detainees, bearing in mind the exclusion of fundamental liberties by Article149. In her view, the curtailment of judicial review should therefore be rejected, as it does not accord with the [...] "spirit" [...] of Article151 of the Constitution which ensures safeguards for detainees.|$|E
500|$|Rodham {{maintained}} {{her interest}} in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles [...] "Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect" [...] in 1977 and [...] "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" [...] in 1979. The latter continued <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, [...] "Her articles were important, {{not because they were}} radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate." [...] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as [...] "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades", while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority, would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents, and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.|$|E
500|$|The Rights of Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the Rights of Men. In the Rights of Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the Rights of Woman, she is concerned with the rights afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate <b>her</b> <b>argument</b> to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the Rights of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. The Rights of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
