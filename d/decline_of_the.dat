30|$|<b>The</b> initial <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{species were}} due to <b>the</b> precipitous loss <b>of</b> habitat to logging around <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century, which reduced the vast longleaf forests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southeast US to only 3 % of their original extent (Frost 1993). However, <b>the</b> more recent <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970 s and 1980 s {{were due to}} habitat changes following fire suppression, which promoted development of dense hardwood midstory and greatly reduced groundcover vegetation (Conner and Rudolph 1989, Conner et al. 2001). When hardwood midstory begins to reach cavity-level height, the birds abandon their cavities and associated territories (USFWS 2003). <b>The</b> <b>declines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970 s and 1980 s were characterized by abandonment of territories in fire-suppressed areas and not by reduced survival or productivity, or by loss of territories to timber cutting (Walters 1991). Also, the birds prefer to forage in habitat with a rich groundcover dominated by grasses and forbs and little or no hardwood midstory, and reproductive success is higher and group size larger in territories with more such habitat (USFWS 2003). Thus, both foraging habitat preferences and dependence on fire to maintain habitat suitability qualify the red-cockaded woodpecker as a fire specialist.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} known that some solar {{activity}} indicators show a double-peak feature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in sunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunspot cycle by examining <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> polar and low latitude coronal hole areas and <b>the</b> statistics <b>of</b> splitting and merging events of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C 3 in solar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the sunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable second maximum in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle, in which low latitude coronal holes are dominant. <b>The</b> events <b>of</b> coronal hole splitting or merging, which are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle.
