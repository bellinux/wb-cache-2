5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E

The Independent suggested that this was due to Corbyn being seen to make a stand against an unpopular operator.|$|R

25|$|The Book of Joshua takes forward Deuteronomy's {{theme of}} Israel {{as a single}} people worshipping Yahweh in the land God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>them.</b> Yahweh, as the main {{character}} in the book, takes the initiative in conquering the land, and Yahweh's power wins the battles. For example, the walls of Jericho fall because Yahweh fights for Israel, not because the Israelites show superior fighting ability. The potential disunity of Israel is a constant theme, the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the Jordan. Chapter 22:19 even hints that the land across the Jordan is unclean and that the tribes who live there have secondary status.|$|E

25|$|The book {{consists}} of three sermons or speeches delivered to the Israelites by Moses on the plains of Moab, shortly before they enter the Promised Land. The first sermon recounts the forty years of wilderness wanderings which have led to this moment, and ends with an exhortation to observe the law (or teachings), later {{referred to as the}} Law of Moses; the second reminds the Israelites of the need for monotheism and observance of the laws (or teachings) he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>them,</b> on which their possession of the land depends; and the third offers the comfort that even should Israel prove unfaithful and so lose the land, with repentance all can be restored.|$|E

The myth Enki and Inanna {{tells the story of}} how the young goddess of the É-anna temple of Uruk feasts with her father Enki. The two deities compete against each other in a drinking competition. Then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the Mes, the gifts of civilized life. The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the Mes, only to be informed that he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> to Inanna. Upset at his actions, he sends Galla demons to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay at Uruk. Enki realises that he has been tricked in his hubris and accepts a peace treaty forever with Uruk.|$|E
