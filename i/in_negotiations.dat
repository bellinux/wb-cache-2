40|$|There is now {{considerable}} {{evidence in}} social psychology, economics, and related disciplines that emotion {{plays an important}} role <b>in</b> <b>negotiation.</b> For example, humans make greater concessions <b>in</b> <b>negotiation</b> to an opposing human who expresses anger, and they make fewer concessions to an opponent who expresses happiness, compared to a no-emotion-expression control. However, in AI, despite the wide interest <b>in</b> <b>negotiation</b> as a means to resolve differences between agents and humans, emotion has been largely ignored. This paper explores whether expression of anger or happiness by computer agents, <b>in</b> a multiissue <b>negotiation</b> task, can produce effects that resemble effects seen <b>in</b> human-human <b>negotiation.</b> The paper presents an experiment where participants play with agents that express emotions (anger vs. happiness vs. control) through differen...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, the British airport {{operator}} TBI {{announced it was}} <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> to purchase an airport close to Oslo, and Dagens Næringsliv speculated {{that it could be}} Notodden. The municipality confirmed that they were <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> to establish a limited company to operate the airport, which would be jointly owned by Air Team and the municipality. In 2000, Bergen Air Transport started flying between Notodden and Bergen, using a Cessna 421B. It transported 1,000 passengers in 2000, and 1,500 the following year. During the summer of 2002, the company also attempted to fly from Notodden to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, but was forced to give up due to lack of passengers. In 1995, the airport saw 770 arriving and departing passengers. It increased to 2,467 the following year but fell to 986 in 1998 before increasing to 3,682 in 1999. The patronage has since varied significantly from year to year, but has stayed in the range between 1,500 and 3,500 passengers per year.|$|E

40|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} {{suggest that}} men will persist more <b>in</b> <b>negotiation</b> than women, particularly in mixed-gender pairs. In contrast, a gender-in-context perspective suggests that women will vary their persistence behavior {{more than men}} and become more rather than less persistent in mixed-gender pairs in order to resist male dominance <b>in</b> <b>negotiation.</b> Results of three studies support the gender-in-context perspective, showing that women vary the degree and quality of their persistence behavior more than men depending on their counterpart’s gender. Women became more persistent with male than female negotiating counterparts (Studies 1 - 3). Consistent with the proposition that women persist more with men than women out of resistance to stereotypical male dominance <b>in</b> <b>negotiation,</b> women relied on characteristically low-status forms of influence (more indirect than direct) when persisting with men but not women (Study 3) and women’s extra persistence with male counterparts helped them reduce the gender gap <b>in</b> <b>negotiation</b> performance (Study 3). ...|$|R
