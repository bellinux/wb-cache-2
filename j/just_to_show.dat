When he was serving as a Master of Writing in the Selection Bureau (選曹尚書; i.e., {{the equivalent of a}} present-day human resources officer), he often went around spreading news of scandalous incidents involving his colleagues <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how harsh he could be in criticising others. Lu Mao advised him to forgive others for their past transgressions and focus on praising them for their virtues and contributions instead. He also urged Ji Yan to promote and strengthen a civil culture that might be beneficial to Wu's future developments. Ji Yan ignored Lu Mao's advice and eventually met his downfall.|$|E

Novice Hame and the green {{crescent}} seen on the mood patches previously appeared in [...] "New Earth". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies wanted to visit the same world each year to maintain a sense of continuity, {{something that could be}} hard to do with Doctor Who formula. Producer Phil Collinson remarked that [...] "Gridlock" [...] displayed Davies' tendency to write about [...] "topical" [...] issues; it is set in a dark dystopian future, but is also a satire on the common traffic jam. While the story is bleak, Davies showed how the Doctor transforms the place by literally opening up the sky and bringing in light. Davies also used hymns to signify hope and a togetherness {{of the members of the}} Motorway. Those on the Motorway sing [...] "The Old Rugged Cross", and the hymn heard at the end of the episode is [...] "Abide with Me". The episode also displays the Doctor's growing attachment to Martha; he feels guilty for lying to her and bringing her to New New York <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off and realises that he misses her when she is taken.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Coulter {{joined forces}} with {{previous}} Australian Idol contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo {{to be part of}} the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's single [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, DeAraugo stated that they are [...] "not an Idol supergroup, it's just about finding four female voices. It just so happened the four we've gone with are all from Idol. The single is just to promote the tour, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a taste of what will be on there, but there won't be an album". Young Divas' version of [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] peaked at numbertwo and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's [...] "Happenin' All Over Again". The song peaked at numbernine and was certified gold.|$|E

Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash.

2500|$|In {{an account}} {{recorded}} by Athenaeus, Timocreon {{ended up at}} the court of the Persian king where he distinguished himself as an athlete and glutton, eating so much that the king himself asked him {{what he was trying to}} do, to which Timocreon replied that he was getting ready to beat up countless Persians. He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that [...] "he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on." [...] However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a period}} lasting {{approximately}} between 1390 and 1420 {{there was a}} particularly close correspondence between works produced far apart in Europe. In the north the miniatures of the Très Riches Heures Limbourg brothers, in Italy the Adoration of the Magi of Lorenzo Monaco, and sculpture and miniatures in many countries show very stylised tall figures, the older men with imposingly long beards and swaying figures. [...] Exotic clothes, based loosely on those of the contemporary Middle East or Byzantine Empire, are worn by figures in biblical scenes; many figures seem to be included <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off these costumes. [...] The number of figures in many standard religious scenes is greatly increased; the Magi have large retinues, and the Crucifixion often becomes a crowded event.

As Man Chong predicted, Sun Quan did order his troops to go ashore and put on a show of might. When that happened, the 6,000 troops in Hefei launched a sudden and fierce attack on them. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while some drowned as they tried to flee back to their ships.|$|E

He notes, however, that Tanaka's visuals are over-active make the film a difficult one for most viewers. Tanaka recalled, [...] "I was determined to make a film which was much more impressive than the comic. One image of a film has to be much more impressive than one frame of the comic.

[...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was.

2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles.

Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: [...] "This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [...] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that you're not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We'll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous {{of us who are}} trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you." [...] The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, {{on the day of the}} shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.|$|E
