5000|$|The {{aggregate}} {{fair market}} value (determined as of the <b>grant</b> <b>date)</b> of stock bought by exercising ISOs that are exercisable {{for the first time}} cannot exceed $100,000 in a calendar year.

50|$|In {{the case}} of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than {{periodic}} smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) {{the value of the}} grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial <b>grant</b> <b>date,</b> giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{another method}} was suggested: expensing the options at the {{difference}} between the market price and the strike price when the options are exercised, and not expensing options which are not exercised, and reflecting the unexercised options as a liability on the balance sheet. This method, which defers the expense, was also requested by companies. A method to eventually reconcile the <b>grant</b> <b>date</b> fair-value estimates with the eventual exercise price was also proposed.|$|E

50|$|Stock options under International Financial Reporting Standards are {{addressed}} by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. For transactions with employees and others providing similar services, the entity {{is required to}} measure the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the <b>grant</b> <b>date.</b> In the absence of market prices, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique to estimate what the price of those equity instruments {{would have been on}} the measurement date in an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.

50|$|Stock option expensing was a {{controversy}} {{well before the}} most recent set of controversies in the early 2000s. The earliest attempts by accounting regulators to expense stock options in the early 1990s were unsuccessful and resulted in the promulgation of FAS123 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which required disclosure of stock option positions but no income statement expensing, per se. The controversy continued and in 2005, {{at the insistence of}} the SEC, the FASB modified the FAS123 rule to provide a rule that the options should be expensed as of the <b>grant</b> <b>date.</b> One misunderstanding is that the expense is at the fair value of the options. This is not true. The expense is indeed based on the fair value of the options but that fair value measure does not follow the fair value rules for other items which are governed by a separate set of rules under ASC Topic 820. In addition the fair value measure must be modified for forfeiture estimates and may be modified for other factors such as liquidity before expensing can occur. Finally the expense of the resulting number is rarely made on the <b>grant</b> <b>date</b> but in some cases must be deferred and in other cases may be deferred over time as set forth in the revised accounting rules for these contracts known as FAS123(revised).|$|E

50|$|With {{respect to}} the more serious cases of backdating, {{it is likely that}} most of the {{criminal}} actions that the government intended to bring were brought in 2007. There is a five-year statute of limitations for securities fraud, and under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, option grants to senior management must be reported within two days of the <b>grant</b> <b>date.</b> This all but eliminated the opportunity for senior management to engage any meaningful options backdating. Therefore, any criminal prosecution is likely to be based on option grants made before Sarbanes-Oxley took effect, and the deadline facing the government for bringing those prosecutions has already passed.|$|E
50|$|Chief Executive Officer Amnon Landan, Chief Financial Officer Douglas Smith, and General Counsel Susan Skaer {{resigned}} in November 2005 after a special committee {{at the company}} found that they benefited from a program to favorably price option grants. The committee found that, beginning in 1995, there were 49 instances in which the stated date of a stock option grant {{was different from the}} date on which the option appeared to have been granted. In almost every case, the price on the actual date was higher than the price on the stated <b>grant</b> <b>date.</b> A former Chief Financial Officer, Sharlene Abrams, later associated with the financial misreporting, had resigned previously in November 2001.|$|E
5000|$|A {{submarine}} patent is {{a patent}} whose issuance and publication are intentionally delayed by the applicant {{for a long}} time, such as several years. This strategy requires a patent system where, first, patent applications are not published, and, second, patent term is measured from <b>grant</b> <b>date,</b> not from priority or filing date. In the United States, patent applications filed before November 2000 were not published and remained secret until they were granted. Analogous to a submarine, therefore, submarine patents could stay [...] "under water" [...] for long periods until they [...] "emerged" [...] and surprised the relevant market.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{patent term}} under the 1790 Patent Act was decided individually for each patent, but [...] "not exceeding fourteen years". The 1836 Patent Act (5 Stat. 117, 119, 5) provided (in {{addition to the}} fourteen-year term) an extension [...] "for the term of seven years from and after the expiration of the first term" [...] in certain circumstances. In 1861 the seven-year extension was eliminated and the term changed to seventeen years (12 Stat. 246, 249, 16) (from <b>grant</b> <b>date).</b> The signing of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act then changed the patent term from seventeen years from the date of issue to the current twenty years from the earliest filing date.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2006, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) {{agree that}} the fair value at the <b>grant</b> <b>date</b> should be {{estimated}} using an option pricing model.

Note that, having incorporated these, {{the value of the}} ESO will typically [...] "be much less than Black-Scholes prices for corresponding market-traded options...." [...] Here, in discussing the valuation, FAS 123 Revised (A15) - which does not prescribe a specific valuation model - states that:a lattice model can be designed to accommodate dynamic assumptions of expected volatility and dividends over the option’s contractual term, and estimates of expected option exercise patterns during the option’s contractual term, including the effect of blackout periods. Therefore, the design of a lattice model more fully reflects the substantive characteristics of a particular employee share option or similar instrument. Nevertheless, both a lattice model and the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, as well as other valuation techniques that meet the requirements … can provide a fair value estimate that is consistent with the measurement objective and fair-value-based method….|$|E
