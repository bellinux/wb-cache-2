To obtain the target polarimetric scattering information, conventional polarimetric radar systems alternately switch (or simultaneously transmit) the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations at the transmission side, and simultaneously receive both polarizations at the reception side, consequently resulting in four polarization combinations: HH, HV, VH, and VV polarizations.|$|E

Another input to the infrastructure is the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>target</b> platform which includes both hardware, e. g., the type of CPU, memory hierarchy or accelerators, and software, e. g., the compiler or the MPI implementation. With these inputs, the infrastructure will automatically generate target code which is especially tuned for the application and platform at hand.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) target {{reconstruction}} {{provides a}} more specific <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>target</b> features, which would be beneficial for the classification process. In this paper a 3 D imaging technique of non-cooperative target acquired by airborne radar system is presented. Traditional two-dimensional (2 D) single channel inverse SAR (ISAR) imaging locates each target scattering center in range and Doppler. The third point scatterer coordinate that allows to reconstruct the target in a 3 D space is estimated using interferometric phases of two non-parallel baselines and Doppler point scatterer location. The accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction depends {{on the length of}} the baselines and on the focusing achieved by the 2 D imaging process for each channel. The relative movement between the target and the airborne system increases the difficulty to form a well-focused 2 D image. The radial component of both radar and target motion affects the image focusing. Moreover traditional image formation method as range/Doppler algorithm introduces further blurring due to the wideband situation. To improve the image quality resulting from standard radial motion compensation techniques and range/Doppler image formation, a method for 2 D image processing based on range/velocity data formatting is additionally applied...|$|E

This {{is the first}} X-ray detection of a brown dwarf intermediate in age between ~ 12 and ~ 320 Myr. The emission appears persistent, although we cannot rule out flare-like behaviour with a decay time-scale > 4 ks. The time-averaged X-ray luminosity of Lx = (3. 3 +/- 0. 8) x 10 ^{ 27 } erg/s, and its ratios with the bolometric (Lx/Lbol = 10 ^{- 3. 05 }) and Halpha (Lx/LHa = 4. 0) luminosities suggest magnetic activity {{similar to that of}} active main-sequence M dwarfs, such as the M 7 old-disc star VB 8, though the suspected binary nature of Roque 14 merits further attention.
