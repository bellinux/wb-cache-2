5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E

Russert acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|At Bazarov's home, {{they are}} {{received}} enthusiastically by his parents, {{and the traditional}} moeurs of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Maryino, stopping {{on the way to}} see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.|$|E

Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E

Dennis Hopper was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over [...] "creative differences". Harris was a last-minute replacement. A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure. Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir {{did not like the}} idea.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Anniyan {{addresses}} a huge gathering {{was shot in}} a stadium in Hyderabad. As <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the audience, the lights turn on and off in the background. Speaking on how the sequence was filmed, Ravi Varman said that they decided not to light up the entire stadium as they felt it would have looked flat. As the sequence was important to the film, he juxtaposed the stadium with light and shadow {{so that it would}} look different. During the pre-climax scene, when Ambi is held custody and enquired by Prabhakar, Ambi's persona keeps switching between the characters Ambi and Anniyan. Dubbed the [...] "chameleon act" [...] in the media, Vikram claims to have completed the sequence in a single take.|$|E

500|$|Episode two, [...] "The Mission", {{discusses}} how Jesus {{became popular}} {{and why the}} Pharisees might have seen him as a potential threat. Bowen visits the Dome of the Rock, the site of Jerusalem's temple, and discusses how Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee to recruit his disciples. He speaks with Orna Cohen, a conservator of antiquities who led the excavation of the Sea of Galilee Boat, who suggests that the boat may have been similar to one owned by Saint Peter. Bowen then travels to Capernaum and visits the House of Peter, where <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> Mordechai Aviam, an archaeologist from the Israel Antiquities Authority. Aviam states that first-century Greek [...] "graffiti" [...] in the house suggests that the house belonged to Peter. Bowen visits the tomb of a first-century scholar and miracle-worker named Hanina ben Dosa, and contrasts Hanina's life with that of Jesus's: for example, while Jesus was executed, Hanina was not.|$|E

In return, Geoff punches Aden and knocks him out. Aden later helps an inebriated Annie, who has had her drink spiked. [...] Tony and Geoff presume that Aden was responsible as he was previously involved in similar prank with Tamsyn Armstrong (Gabrielle Scollay), and Annie lies to get Aden into trouble. The rest of the town believe he is to blame, so he seeks help from local lawyer Morag.

At the end of the episode, it is revealed that everything that happened since Maddy was stabbed was actually a dream and that Maddy actually died in Chantelle's attack. This whole episode was Maddy living out her perfect day in her head. On October 21, 2009, Chantelle was admitted to AAU, pregnant after her boyfriend kicked her in the stomach. Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> her from the shadows, asking her what year it is.
