5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the <b>immunocompetence</b> of offspring.|$|E

Laboratory studies further demonstrated that pesticide exposure reduced host <b>immunocompetence</b> against parasites as the biological mechanism (Kiesecker 2002).

50|$|While the {{ultimate}} causation for begging {{is an increase}} in the animal's individual fitness, several theories have been proposed for how food begging evolved proximate causes including scramble competition, honest signalling of need, and cooperative begging by siblings. Various types of information such as nutritional status or <b>immunocompetence</b> can be transmitted with auditory and visual begging signals and the behavior can be modulated by several factors such as brood size and hormones. Similarly, several costs of begging have been investigated including energetic, growth and predation cost. Begging from humans also occurs under artificial circumstances such as donkeys, elephants and dolphins begging for food from tourists.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory of}} <b>immunocompetence</b> handicaps {{suggests}} that androgen-mediated traits accurately signal condition {{due to the}} immunosuppressive effects of androgens. [...] This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of ornamental traits and other tissues, including the immune system, or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression {{of the immune system}} enhances fertility. [...] Healthy individuals can afford to suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, which also augments secondary sexual traits and displays. A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support.|$|E
5000|$|These {{results have}} hatched further studies, {{numbering}} over 200.

This was shown by measuring lymphocyte response to the foreign mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (ConA) just prior to and 6 weeks after writing. The significantly increased lymphocyte response led to speculation that expressive writing enhances <b>immunocompetence.</b> The results of a preliminary study of 40 people diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder suggests that routinely engaging in expressive writing may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} recent {{interest in the}} effects of life-history decisions on <b>immunocompetence</b> in birds. If <b>immunocompetence</b> is limited by available resources, then trade-offs between investment in life-history components and investment in <b>immunocompetence</b> could be important in determining optimal life-history traits. For this to be true: (1) <b>immunocompetence</b> must be limited by resources, (2) investment in life-history components must be negatively correlated with <b>immunocompetence,</b> and (3) <b>immunocompetence</b> must be positively correlated with fitness. To gather such empirical data, ecologists {{need to be able}} to measure <b>immunocompetence.</b> We review techniques used to measure <b>immunocompetence</b> and how they are applied by ecologists. We also consider the components of the immune system that constitute <b>immunocompetence</b> and evaluate the possible consequences of measuring <b>immunocompetence</b> in different ways. We then review the empirical evidence for life-history trade-offs involving immune defense. We conclude that there is some evidence suggesting that <b>immunocompetence</b> is limited by resources and that investment in certain life-history components reduces <b>immunocompetence.</b> However, the evidence that <b>immunocompetence</b> is related to fitness is circumstantial at present, although consistent with the hypothesis that <b>immunocompetence</b> and fitness are positively correlated. We argue that future work needs to examine the fitness effects of variation in <b>immunocompetence</b> and suggest that artificial selection experiments offer a potentially important tool for addressing this issue.

40|$|The <b>immunocompetence</b> {{handicap}} hypothesis {{suggests that}} the immune system competes for resources with sexually selected ornaments; variation in ornaments might reflect genetic variation for <b>immunocompetence.</b> We tested this genetic prediction by mating scorpionfly females to males differing in {{the expression of a}} condition-dependent ornament trait, saliva secretion, and then comparing offspring <b>immunocompetence.</b> We found several indications of an <b>immunocompetence</b> handicap in our study: females had superior <b>immunocompetence</b> compared with males, the different immune traits were positively correlated, and there were indications of genetic variation in immune traits. However, we found {{no significant difference in the}} <b>immunocompetence</b> of offspring derived from males differing in ornament expression, only a tendency for sons of ornamented males to possess slightly better <b>immunocompetence.</b> The estimated effect of fathers on offspring <b>immunocompetence</b> was rather small, but it might be a sufficient benefit of female choice, provided that the costs of choice are small.

40|$|Parasites {{have been}} argued to {{influence}} clutch size evolution, but past work and theory has largely focused on within-species optimization solutions rather than clearly addressing among-species variation. The effects of parasites on clutch size variation among species can be complex, however, because different parasites can induce age-specific differences in mortality {{that can cause}} clutch size to evolve in different directions. We provide a conceptual argument that differences in <b>immunocompetence</b> among species should integrate differences in overall levels of parasite-induced mortality to which a species is exposed. We test this assumption and show that mortality caused by parasites is positively correlated with <b>immunocompetence</b> measured by cell-mediated measures. Under life history theory, clutch size should increase with increased adult mortality and decrease with increased juvenile mortality. Using <b>immunocompetence</b> as a general assay of parasite-induced mortality, we tested these predictions by using data for 25 species. We found that clutch size increased strongly with adult <b>immunocompetence.</b> In contrast, clutch size decreased weakly with increased juvenile <b>immunocompetence.</b> But, <b>immunocompetence</b> of juveniles may be constrained by selection on adults, and, when we controlled for adult <b>immunocompetence,</b> clutch size decreased with juvenile <b>immunocompetence.</b> Thus, <b>immunocompetence</b> seems to reflect evolutionary differences in parasite virulence experienced by species, and differences in age-specific parasite virulence appears to exert opposite selection on clutch size evolution...|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in <b>immunocompetence,</b> {{usually in}} the direction of inferior male <b>immunocompetence,</b> has historically been explained as the result of proximate physiological mechanisms such as the immunosuppressive effects of the male hormone testosterone. More recently, {{it has been argued that}} this pattern is best understood as a result of resource-based trade-offs between male mating effort and immune defense, a trade-off that females do not make. The central prediction of this hypothesis is that as the strength of sexual selection on males increases, the magnitude of the sex differences in <b>immunocompetence</b> will increase. Two implicit assumptions of this argument are that 1) longevity is of more importance for female than for male fitness and 2) that the primary benefit of <b>immunocompetence</b> is increased longevity. However, both of these assumptions may not be as broadly applicable as has been argued. We have modeled the optimal allocation to <b>immunocompetence</b> for males and females without making these assumptions. We find that the optimal allocation to immune defense for males decreases as the strength of sexual selection increases, as predicted. However, males may still invest more, relative to females, into <b>immunocompetence</b> if the impact of parasites on condition differs for the sexes and/or if the relationship between condition and reproduction differs for the sexes.

40|$|The {{relations}} between genetic change in domestic livestock and infectious disease (including both its epidemiology and the animal's reaction to it) are examined. The overall picture is confusing {{because there are}} different, and seemingly unrelated, ways of considering the issue. An attempt is made to put these together into a more general framework. Four processes of particular interest are distinguished and discussed in more detail: (i) the way a population's genetic potential for <b>immunocompetence</b> can be changed by breeding, (ii) the way an animal's <b>immunocompetence</b> is influenced by that animal's production potential, {{in combination with the}} environmental resources that are available to it at a given time, (iii) the way the disease status of an animal (and a population of animals) is influenced by its <b>immunocompetence,</b> and (iv) the way the production level of an animal is influenced by activation of its immune system. Ultimately, all four processes influence the realised level of production. This comes down to four questions that need to be addressed: (i) can we use genetic variation in <b>immunocompetence</b> in animal breeding? (ii) does a higher production potential (today's direction of breeding) {{have a negative impact on}} <b>immunocompetence?</b> (iii) does improved <b>immunocompetence</b> result in improved health? and (iv) how large is the negative impact of disease on production...|$|E

40|$|As superorganisms, eusocial insect colonies possess both {{individual}} and social strategies for epidemic control. Both the physiological immune system within individuals {{and an array of}} social behaviours, such as selfâ€“quarantine, collectively comprise the colonyâ€™s <b>immunocompetence.</b> Diet is a modulator of <b>immunocompetence</b> in insects and furthermore insects can self-medicate by ingesting nutrients that promote <b>immunocompetence.</b> However, how diet impacts multiple strategies of epidemic control both physiologically and through social behavioural processes, within a superorganism is not known. Therefore, the central aim of this thesis is to elucidate the role of diet for <b>immunocompetence</b> in the eusocial European honey bee (Apis mellifera). In the first data chapter (Chapter 2), I set the framework for measuring honey bee <b>immunocompetence</b> by describing a time course for the expression of two key components of the physiological immune system after challenge; the phenoloxidase pathway and antimicrobial peptides. I establish that only antimicrobial activity is elicited by an experimental pseudo-bacterial challenge and I identify appropriate time points {{to assess the impact of}} diet on <b>immunocompetence.</b> I demonstrate that short-term pollen starvation has no impact on physiological <b>immunocompetence.</b> In chapter 3 I show that a pseudo-bacterial challenge causes honey bees to adopt a diet that reduces their intake of pollen, whilst maintaining their intake of carbohydrates and I demonstrate that immunologically challenged honey bees forage more intensively. Based on these two findings, I therefore propose that a dietary mechanism underlies increased foraging intensity, which is adaptive as a form of nutritional targeting for self-removal to reduce colony infection. In chapter 4, I demonstrate that a sustained lack of essential amino acids both promotes antimicrobial peptide activity and reduces longevity. Furthermore, I show that, like the trend observed with pollen consumption, a pseudo-bacterial challenge causes honey bees to reduce their intake of essential amino acids, Taken together, these results provide new support for the proposition that through dietary modulation, honey bees nutritionally self-medicate at the level of the superorganism in order to reduce in-hive rates of pathogen transmission by increased physiological <b>immunocompetence,</b> self-removal, and mortality in infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|Yet {{there are}} just a few {{experimental}} studies addressing the <b>immunocompetence</b> handicap hypothesis of Foistad and Karter (1992). We implanted juvenile black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus with testosterone releasing tubes to experimentally test this hypothesis. The effect of testosterone on immune function, secondary sexual traits and body mass were examined. To determine immune function both the primary and the secondary antibody response after immunisation with sheep red blood cells were measured. Also the volume percentage of white blood cells, the sedimentation rate and the number of foot infections were measured. Secondary sexual traits we quantified were the brown mask, the colour of the legs and the bill and the behavioural displays that the gulls performed. As predicted by the <b>immunocompetence</b> handicap hypothesis, testosterone had a positive effect on mask development, bill colour brightness and display rate. However contrary to the hypothesis' predictions neither primary, nor secondary antibody response, nor any other measure of <b>immunocompetence</b> was affected by the testosterone treatment. Testosterone did not affect body mass either. We suggest that the testosterone treated gulls might have compensated for their greater display rates and sexual ornament sizes by having a higher food intake. We also investigated the relation between <b>immunocompetence</b> and secondary sexual traits and between mate choice, and <b>immunocompetence</b> and secondary sexual traits. We found no consistent association between immune function and secondary sexual traits. Our results on mate choice were not conclusive due to low sample size. We conclude that our results do not support the <b>immunocompetence</b> handicap hypothesis. ...|$|E
40|$|Conspicuous {{secondary}} sexual traits {{may have}} evolved as handicap-revealing signals or as badges of status.

In a test of the <b>immunocompetence</b> handicap hypothesis, wild-caught adult male house sparrows were studied in captivity. Birds implanted with elevated doses of testosterone were more dominant, had higher circulating levels of both testosterone and corticosterone and they also harboured relatively larger ectoparasite loads. Higher parasite loads were also associated with individuals showing lower <b>immunocompetence</b> and larger changes in bib size. A new model for <b>immunocompetence</b> effects in sexual selection is introduced, integrating actions that the hypothalamopituitary axis exerts on gonads, adrenals and the thyroid gland.
