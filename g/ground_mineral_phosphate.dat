Different products are derived after processing phosphoric ore, such as <b>mineral</b> and <b>phosphate</b> fertilizers and <b>phosphate</b> <b>mineral</b> supplements (dicalcium-and monocalcium phosphate) for animal feeding. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>mineral</b> additives used in animal food may contain a high activity of uranium.

40|$|The mode of succinate {{mediated}} {{repression of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization {{and the role}} of repressor in suppressing phosphate solubilization phenotype of two free-living nitrogen fixing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was studied. Organic acid mediated <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization phenotype of oxalic acid producing Klebsiella pneumoniae SM 6 and SM 11 were transcriptionally repressed by IclR in presence of succinate as carbon source. Oxalic acid production and expression of genes of the glyoxylate shunt (aceBAK) was found only in glucose but not in succinate- and glucose+succinate-grown cells. IclR, repressor of aceBAK operon, was inactivated using an allelic exchange system resulting in derepressed <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization phenotype through constitutive expression of the glyoxylate shunt. Insertional inactivation of iclR resulted in increased activity of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes even in succinate-grown cells. An augmented phosphate solubilization up to 54 and 59 % soluble phosphate release was attained in glucose+succinate-grown SM 6 Δ and SM 11 Δ strains respectively, compared to glucose-grown cells, whereas phosphate solubilization was absent or negligible in wildtype cells grown in glucose+succinate. Both wildtype and iclR deletion strains showed similar indole- 3 -acetic acid production. Wheat seeds inoculated with wildtype SM 6 and SM 11 improved both root and shoot length by 1. 2 fold. However, iclR deletion SM 6 Δ and SM 11 Δ strains increased root and shoot length by 1. 5 and 1. 4 folds, respectively, compared to uninoculated controls. The repressor inactivated phosphate solubilizers better served the purpose of constitutive phosphate solubilization in pot experiments, where presence of other carbon sources (e. g., succinate) might repress <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization phenotype of wildtype strains...|$|R

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of phosphate starvation Escherichia coli can solubilize <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphates,</b> such as dicalcium phosphate, to orthophosphate {{which is then}} available for uptake and cell growth processes. lac operon fusions were created using MudX phage, and <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization (Mps) mutants were identified by their inability to solubilize <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> on plate assays. Four of these mutants have been mapped on the E. coli chromosome via Hfr matings and are located at two distinct portions of the chromosome; between 23 and 50 minutes and between 60 and 90 minutes. One mutant in each region has phosphate starvation inducible (Psi) promoter activity. One of these mutants (DB 1047) was mapped to between 69 and 75 minutes via F' matings, and fine structure mapped to 75 minutes by hybridization with λ clones from a genomic library of Escherichia coli. DB 1047 was characterized more closely and found to exhibit pleiotropy with regard to several membrane related traits. Evidence {{that this is a}} single insertional event comes from the simultaneous loss of all traits tested in spontaneous revertants. Additionally, a Tn 5 mutant was identified that was identical for these traits. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the mutation carried by DB 1047 is in the ompB locus. This locus consists of the two regulatory cotranscribed genes, ompR and envZ. This locus is involved in regulation of transcription of the ompC and ompF genes for outer membrane porin proteins, and is located at 75 minutes on the chromosome as is the DB 1047 mutation. DB 1047 lacks the outer membrane porin OmpF, a phenotype previously attributed to envZ mutants. However, the ompR 321 mutant resembles DB 1047 in reduced ability to solubilize phosphate. Additional supporting evidence for the DB 1047 mutation belonging to the ompB locus comes from the most recent report that mutations in the himA gene, which I found to be deficient in the ability to solubilize phosphate, also affect the regulation of production of the outer membrane porin OmpF...|$|R

50|$|Cereal grains {{including}} corn, soybean {{and barley}} contain 50 to 75% of their phosphorus {{in the form}} of phytic acid.

30|$|Phosphate rock {{reactivity}} is {{a measure}} of the rate of dissolution of phosphate rocks under standard laboratory conditions or in a given soil and under given field conditions (Rajan et al. 1996).

Sedimentary origin phosphate rocks are generally most reactive and suitable for direct application. Calcium carbonate is the most abundant accessory <b>mineral</b> in <b>phosphate</b> rocks. As calcium carbonate is more soluble than the most chemically reactive <b>phosphate</b> <b>mineral,</b> its dissolution increases the calcium content and pH at the <b>phosphate</b> <b>mineral</b> surface.
