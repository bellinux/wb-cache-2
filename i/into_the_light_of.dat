500|$|On February 3, 2015, Dylan {{released}} Shadows in the Night, featuring ten songs written between 1923 and 1963, {{which have}} been described as part of the Great American Songbook. All the songs on the album were recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of [...] "Sinatra covers". Dylan explained, [...] "I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way. They've been covered enough. Buried, as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day." [...] In an interview, Dylan said he had been thinking about making this record since hearing Willie Nelson's 1978 album Stardust.|$|E
500|$|The {{full title}} of the book is Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book: Or, Up from the Apes! (and Right Back Down)—In Which Are Described in Words and Pictures Businessmen, Private Eyes, Cowboys, and Other Heroes All Exhibiting the Progress of Man from the Darkness of the Cave <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>of</b> Civilization by Means of Television, Wide Screen Movies, the Stone Axe, and Other Useful Arts. [...] At 140 pages, Jungle Book is Kurtzman's longest solo work. [...] Freed from the length {{constraints}} of magazine pieces, Kurtzman was able to make inventive use of page and panel rhythms. [...] According to critic and publisher Kim Thompson, his satire never had [...] "more pitiless a bite" [...] at any other time in his career. [...] Kurtzman had aimed his Mad stories at an adolescent audience; his targeting Jungle Book at an adult audience was uncommon in American comics.|$|E
2500|$|It is on {{this belief}} {{regarding}} {{the origins of the}} war neuroses that Rivers' he formed his [...] "talking cure." [...] Rivers' [...] "talking cure" [...] was primarily based on the ancient belief of catharsis: the idea that bringing repressed memories <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> consciousness rids memories and thoughts of their power. As a result, Rivers spent most of his days talking with the officers at Craiglockhart, guiding them through a process Rivers referred to as autogonosis. Rivers’ autogonosis consisted of two parts. The first part included “re-education,” or educating the patient about the basics of psychology and physiology. River’s method also consisted of helping a soldier comprehend that the illness he was experiencing was not “strange” nor permanent. To Rivers, the war neuroses developed from ingrained ways of reacting, feeling, or thinking: namely, the attempt to wittingly repress all memories of traumatic experiences or unacceptable emotions. [...] Once a patient could understand the source(s) of his troubles (which could be conscious, unconscious, environmental, or a combination), Rivers could then help him contrive ways to overcome these patterns and thus free himself from and/or at least adjust to the illness.|$|E

2500|$|By 1922, renewed {{activity}} under Reverend George Neal saw {{a committee}} established {{to build the}} new church. A large meeting chaired by Archbishop Sharp was held in July to consider whether a new church should be built in timber or brick. The committee emphasised the need to act as soon as possible, as the present building was inadequate for its needs. The vote for a brick church was [...] "practically unanimous". St Paul's attained the status of parish in 1923 and in June 1923 the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane formally acquired a new site for St Paul's {{on the corner of}} Vulture Street and Balmoral Terrace. The elevated site, [...] "nearer the tramline and in a more conspicuous position", was consciously chosen to enhance the prominence of the church within the suburb. At a fundraising event in November, Canon Francis de Witt Batty commended the decision to bring St Paul's Church out of [...] "comparative obscurity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> day", while also noting [...] "Brisbane had awakened at last to its duty in the matter of church building".|$|E
2500|$|With John of Ephesus' fairly {{detailed}} {{report of the}} baptizement of the kingdoms of Nobatia and Alodia, the latter finally steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> history as a fully developed, central Sudanese kingdom. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia {{was the last to}} be converted to Christianity. If John is correct, the Alodian king was very aware of the baptisms of Nobadia in 543 (Miaphysite branch) and Makuria in around 568/569 (Melkite branch). He describes how the Alodian king sent a delegation to the king of Nobadia, requesting a bishop to be sent to him to [...] "instruct his people and baptize them". The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the king, his family and the local nobility. This event marked the end of the post-Meroitic period and the dawn of the [...] "Medieval" [...] or [...] "Christian" [...] period of central Sudan. How fast and how deep Christianity spread among the Alodians is still very hard to say. It is possible that after conversion, several temples were converted into churches, like those in Musawwarat es-Sufra and Meroe. The immediate organization of dioceses has also to be assumed. Nevertheless, it must be expected that especially in Alodia, the Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded rather slow, if it occurred at all.|$|E
2500|$|King Arthur comes {{inside the}} Underbrooke diner, {{confused}} {{and not knowing}} that he is dead, until he is reunited with Hook who after a denial and angry conversation tells him he's in the Underworld now, he asks for Arthur's help in stopping Hades. King Arthur agrees to help him after being told he can either be sent to a better place or worse place or be trapped here forever. Later, Hook and King Arthur searched Hades' lair where they look for Hades' story, when Arthur realizes {{that the only way}} that Hades keeps his secrets would be inside his throne just like Arthur would do and find the missing pages. Shortly after that, Hook and King Arthur learn from Cruella that the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] book is near the River of Lost Souls, and when Hook and King Arthur find it there the lost Souls attempt to take it and Arthur but thanks to Hook he saves both Arthur and the book, where they discover the only way to destroy Hades is by using the Olympian Crystal, and Hook uses the book to magically reach the living successfully (after Emma sees it). Later, King Arthur decides to stay in the Underworld to repair it, telling Hook that he was prophesized to repair a broken kingdom, thinking it was Camelot when it was really the Underworld. Hook steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> Mount Olympus and he meets Zeus, who then shows Hook {{the way back to the}} land of the living.|$|E

2500|$|Alston's murals {{were hung}} in the Women's Pavilion of the {{hospital}} over uncapped radiators which caused the paintings to deteriorate from the steam. Plans failed to recap the radiators. In 1959 Alston estimated, {{in a letter to}} the Department of Public Works, that the conservation would cost $1,500 but the funds were never acquired. In 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, Alston was asked to create another mural for the hospital to be placed in a pavilion named after the assassinated civil rights leader titled Man Emerging from the Darkness of Poverty and Ignorance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>of</b> a Better World. One year after Alston's death in 1977, a group of artists and historians, including the renowned painter and collagist Romare Bearden and art historian Greta Berman, together with administrators from the hospital, and from the NYC Art Commission, examined the murals, and presented a proposal for their restoration to then-mayor Ed Koch. [...] The request was approved, and conservator Alan Farancz set to work in 1979, rescuing the murals from further decay. Many years passed, and the murals began to deteriorate again – especially the Alston works, which continued to suffer effects from the radiators. [...] In 1991 the Municipal Art Society's Adopt-a-Mural program was launched and the Harlem Hospital murals were chosen for further restoration (Greta Berman. Personal experience). A grant from Alston's sister Rousmaniere Wilson and step-sister Aida Bearden Winters assisted in completing a restoration of the works in 1993. In 2005 Harlem Hospital announced a $2 million project to conserve Alston's murals and three other pieces in the original commissioned project as part of a $225 million hospital expansion.|$|E
