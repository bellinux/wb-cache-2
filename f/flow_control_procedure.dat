40|$|This paper {{presents}} an admission control framework for Expedited Forwarding traffic in a Differentiated Service network. The {{aim is to}} overcome the limitations, in terms of achievable efficiency, which are proper of a deterministic "worst-case " based on the zero loss assumption. An admission <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> is defined which provides quantifiable end-to-end QoS guarantees in terms of maximum delay and per-flow loss probability. The <b>flow</b> admission <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> relies on the analytical bounds for the packet loss probabilities which are evaluated for each node in the flow path. The degradation of the statistical characteristics of the flow due to packet clumping through the network is taken into account.

In order to exploit it in a range of cases of practical interest, a dropping device is introduced before the FIFO multiplexer. The purpose of the dropper is to discard packets in order to avoid conflicts at burst scale. The loss introduced by the dropper is properly taken into account in the evaluation of the bound for the node loss probability. The interactions between EF traffic and non-EF packets are also considered. Finally, a comparison between analytical bounds and actual performance results obtained by simulations is presented.

40|$|The present work {{provides}} an optimal control strategy, {{based on the}} nonlinear Navier–Stokes equations, aimed at hampering {{the rapid growth of}} unsteady finite-amplitude perturbations in a Blasius boundary-layer flow. A variational procedure is used to find the blowing and suction control law at the wall providing the maximum damping of the energy of a given perturbation at a given target time, with the final aim of leading the flow back to the laminar state. Two optimally growing finite-amplitude initial perturbations capable of leading very rapidly to transition have been used to initialize the <b>flow.</b> The nonlinear <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> has been found able to drive such perturbations back to the laminar state, provided that the target time of the minimization and the region in which the blowing and suction is applied have been suitably chosen. On the other hand, an equivalent <b>control</b> <b>procedure</b> based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations has been found much less effective, being not able to lead the flow to the laminar state when finite-amplitude disturbances are considered. Regions of strong sensitivity to blowing and suction have been also identified for the given initial perturbations: when the control is actuated in such regions, laminarization is also observed for a shorter extent of the actuation region. The nonlinear optimal blowing and suction law consists of alternating wall-normal velocity perturbations, which appear to modify the core flow structures by means of two distinct mechanisms: (i) a wall-normal velocity compensation at small times; (ii) a rotation-counterbalancing effect al larger times. Similar control laws have been observed for different target times, values of the cost parameter, and streamwise extents of the blowing and suction zone, meaning that these two mechanisms are robust features of the optimal control strategy, provided that the nonlinear effects are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{is formed}} {{by a group}} of mobile nodes {{connected}} by wireless links. The nodes can talk to each other by direct peer-to-peer wireless communication when they are close to each other. When the sender and receiver are far away, their packets can be forwarded by the intermediate nodes along a multi-hop path. As an emerging networking technique, a MANET is envisioned to become a stand-alone network for a group of mobile users, or as a stub-network to connect to the Internet. In this thesis, we focus on the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> problem in this network. Depending on whether the routers agree to forward packets for each other, different <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes are proposed for both cooperative and non-cooperative MANET environments. In cooperative <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> we first study the two prominent <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes in the Internet, i. e., TCP and equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> We provide an augmentation to TCP in order to improve its performance, and discover several limitations of applying equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> to the MANET domain. Prompted by the deficiencies of these implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes, we design a router-assisted explicit rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme (called EXACT) for MANETs. Our result shows that EXACT achieves much better performance than the implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes. Therefore, we advocate using router-assisted explicit <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> as exemplified by EXACT, in the MANET domain. Traditionally, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> has been studied in a cooperative network environment. Such cooperative behavior is not a realistic assumption in a public MANET formed by a random group of strangers. Users in this network are likely to behave selfishly, by refusing to forward other users' packets. Under this non-cooperative environment, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering are two problems closely related to each other. A <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> solution would be meaningless if the intermediate routers do not agree to carry the traffic for others. However, existing work in incentive engineering provides only stand-alone solutions, and fails to recognize its close relation with <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> To this end, we propose a scheme called iPass, which is a joint solution for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering in MANETs. iPass adopts the ``pay for service'' model of cooperation, and utilizes an auction mechanism at each router to fairly allocate bandwidth resources to the passing flows. At the same time, the auction market gives explicit rate signals to the end hosts for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> purposes. By design of the auction algorithm, iPass achieves several desirable system properties, such as bidding user's true valuation for bandwidth. Therefore, iPass provides an innovative and graceful solution for the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering problems in a non-cooperative MANET environment...|$|R
