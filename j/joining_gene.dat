50|$|In {{the season}} opener game at the Tennessee Titans on September 11, Diggs led the Vikings with seven catches for 103 yards on nine targets. Despite being listed as the team's No. 2 wide {{receiver}} behind Charles Johnson, Diggs still led the team in targets, receptions, and yards as the Vikings were forced to throw more than expected with the Titans bottling up the running game. In Week 2, Diggs posted another stellar performance against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. With the Packers stacking the box to stop the running game, Diggs exploited man-to-man coverage from second-year cornerback Damarious Randall and became {{the focal point of}} the offense, playing a key role in the Vikings' 17-14 win over the Packers as he finished the game with career-highs in both catches with 9 and receiving yards with 182. This game was Sam Bradford's first as a Viking, and the team's first in the new U.S. Bank Stadium. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week, becoming the ninth different Viking to earn NFC Player of the Week honors under head coach Mike Zimmer. Combining his 182 yards with his 103-yard performance at Tennessee in week 1, Diggs became only the third receiver in team history to have back-to-back 100-plus-yard games in the first two games of the season, <b>joining</b> <b>Gene</b> Washington (152 and 172 in 1969) and Cris Carter (121 and 107 in 1997). After Week 2, Diggs was the leader in receiving yards in the NFL. In the Vikings' overtime loss against the Detroit Lions in Week 9, Diggs set a personal-best with 13 catches for 80 yards, which passed Randy Moss and Percy Harvin (10 apiece) for receptions against the Lions. His 13 receptions also set a team record for most receptions in a November game and ranks third all-time behind Rickey Young (15) and Cris Carter (14). Diggs was part of a receiving duo, along with Adam Thielen, that became the first pair of Vikings wide receivers with 900 yards each since Randy Moss and Cris Carter accomplished that back in 2000. Diggs finished the season with 84 receptions on 111 targets for 903 yards and three touchdowns. His 75% catch rate ranked fifth among NFL wide receivers in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Immunoglobulin kappa light {{chains are}} coded for {{by at least}} three {{distinct}} gene segments designated variable, joining, and constant. The <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> codes for the 13 amino acid segment linking the variable and constant regions. This peptide includes the last amino acid (96) in the third complementarity-determining region and thus could introduce structural diversity. We have determined the light chain variable region sequences from three myeloma proteins with beta(1, 6) galactan-binding specificity, bringing to six the number of light chains sequenced from proteins demonstrating this specificity. Five of these have isoleucine at position 96 and the sixth tryptophan. This substitution appears to be accommodated with no significant change in association constant for a beta(1, 6) galactan hapten. Additionally, as many as nine substitutions are found in both light and heavy chain complementarity-determining regions between {{members of this group}} although only minimal variations in hapten binding affinity are observed. The isoleucine found at position 96 in five of the kappa chains could not be coded for by any of the <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> nucleotide sequences previously observed and would require a novel nucleotide sequence at the recombination site between variable and joining genes to produce the observed protein structure.

BEAD- 1 blocked {{the ability of the}} TCR δ enhancer (Eδ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a chromatin-integrated construct.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{untreated}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with histologic progression over 1 yr from a low-grade, small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma to a high-grade, small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma. Both lymphomas had identical immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> (JH), kappa light-chain <b>joining</b> <b>gene,</b> and bcl- 2 gene rearrangements, indicating the clonal identity of the two tumors. The Ig heavy chain locus on one chromosome 14 was involved in an initial t(14; 18) translocation as shown by comigrating JH and bcl- 2 rearrangements. However, the oncogene c-myc was in the germline configuration in the initial lymphoma but had one allele rearranged near the 3 ' end of exon I in the high-grade tumor; DNA sequence analysis was consistent with a chromosomal breakpoint at that site. The presence of the c-myc rearrangement in the high-grade tumor suggest a role for c-myc in the clonal evolution of the low-grade tumor into a more aggressive lymphoma. The coexistence of both bcl- 2 gene and c-myc oncogene rearrangements in the same tumor is unusual, {{with only a few}} cases reported. Furthermore, this case is unique in the direct demonstration of the histologic and clinical progression of a human lymphoma associated with the sequential rearrangement of the bcl- 2 gene and the c-myc oncogene...|$|E
40|$|Recently it {{has become}} {{possible}} to introduce predesigned mutations into a given gene in the mouse germ line by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The mutations are usually introduced by inserting the neomycin phosphotransferase gene into an exon of a particular gene. Here we describe an extension of this method that can result {{in at least a}} 15 -kilobase-long deletion. The deletion created in the present work encompasses one of the two diversity gene segments of the mouse T-cell receptor beta-subunit locus, 10 out of the 12 <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> segments, and both constant gene segments. This strategy is a valuable alternative to sequential targeting of multiple genes forming a gene cluster, could simplify the construction of plasmids to be used for targeting, and could be the solution for inactivating small genes that have eluded conventional targeting approaches...|$|E
40|$|The αβ T {{cells are}} {{important}} {{components of the}} adaptive immune system and can recognize {{a vast array of}} peptides presented by MHC molecules. The ability of these T cells to recognize the complex depends on the diversity of the αβ TR, which is generated by a recombination of specific Variable, Diversity and <b>Joining</b> <b>genes</b> for the β chain, and Variable and <b>Joining</b> <b>genes</b> for the α chain. In this study, we analysed the genomic structure and the gene content of the TRB locus in Camelus dromedarius, which is a species belonging to the Tylopoda suborder. The most noteworthy result is the presence of three in tandem TRBD-J-C clusters in the dromedary TRB locus, which is similar to clusters found in sheep, cattle and pigs and suggests a common duplication event occurred prior to the Tylopoda/Ruminantia/Suina divergence. Conversely, a significant contraction of the dromedary TRBV genes, which was previously found in the TRG and TRD loci, was observed with respect to the other artiodactyl species...|$|R

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus {{transformation}} of B-cell-depleted bone marrow cells from human fetuses {{allowed us to}} identify novel cell types characterized by the expression of immunoglobulin kappa or lambda light chain without heavy chains. Four kappa-only clones with normal karyotype were obtained and examined for their immunoglobulin gene configurations and expression. All four clones had kappa-chain gene rearrangements at either one or both alleles, but the heavy-chain gene loci in these clones either were in germ-line context or had undergone only D-JH rearrangements (D and JH represent diversity and <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> segments). All clones contained kappa mRNA of normal size at levels consistent with the protein level, except for one clone that no longer produced kappa protein.

The results suggest that the mu heavy-chain protein is not an obligatory prerequisite for light-chain gene rearrangements...|$|E
40|$|RAGs (recombination {{activating}} genes) {{are responsible}} for the generation of antigen receptor diversity through the process of combinatorial joining of different V (variable), D (diversity) and J (<b>joining)</b> <b>gene</b> segments. In addition to its physiological property, wherein RAG functions as a sequence-specific nuclease, it can also act as a structure-specific nuclease leading to genomic instability and cancer. In the present study, we investigate the factors that regulate RAG cleavage on non-B DNA structures. We find that RAG binding and cleavage on heteroduplex DNA is dependent on the length of the double-stranded flanking region. Besides, the immediate flanking double-stranded region regulates RAG activity in a sequence-dependent manner. Interestingly, the cleavage efficiency of RAGs at the heteroduplex region is influenced by the phasing of DNA. Thus, our results suggest that sequence, length and phase positions of the DNA can affect the efficiency of RAG cleavage when it acts as a structure-specific nuclease. These findings provide novel insights on the regulation of the pathological functions of RAGs...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} a translocation, t(9; 14) (p 13;q 32), in a diffuse large-cell {{lymphoma}} cell line, KIS- 1, that expresses the Ki- 1 (CD 30) antigen.

Class switch recombination deleted most of the constant genes of IGH (CH) and juxtaposed the C alpha 2 gene downstream of the translocation junction. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal hybridization demonstrated that the translocated segment was normally located at band p 13 of chromosome 9. The chromosome 9 sequences were transcriptionally active, giving rise to transcripts of approximately 11 kilobases.

40|$|Human {{bone marrow}} cells were {{depleted}} of B lymphocytes to enrich for precursor B cells {{that could be}} transformed with Epstein-Barr virus. Transformed immunoglobulin-negative precursors either maintained their immunoglobulin genes in the germ-line configuration or had undergone DJ or abortive VDJ rearrangements (V, D, and J represent variable, diversity, and <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> segments). All cell lines and their derivative clones, even those with no detectable immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, generated subpopulations of cells that produced high levels of joining (J) chain when analyzed by immunoprecipitation after biosynthetic labeling and by blot hybridization of cytoplasmic RNA. Morphologic and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that J-chain production was confined to clonal progeny that had exited the cell cycle to undergo plasma-cell differentiation. Analysis of cell surface antigens revealed expression of several B-cell maturational markers, including complement receptor type 2 (CR 2) and plasma cell antigen 1 (PCA- 1). Epstein-Barr virus can thus transform B-cell progenitors, allowing them to proliferate and undergo terminal B-cell differentiation coupled with J-chain expression. These events appear to occur independently of the immunoglobulin gene status of the transformed cells...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin {{genes are}} {{generated}} during differentiation of B lymphocytes by <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> segments. A mouse pre-B cell contains a functional immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, but no light-chain gene. Although {{there is only}} one heavy-chain locus, there are two lightchain loci: κ and λ. It has been reported that κ loci in the germ-line configuration are never (in man) or very rarely (in the mouse) present in cells with functionally rearranged λ-chain genes. Two explanations have been proposed to explain this: (a) the ordered rearrangement theory, which postulates that light-chain gene rearrangement in the pre-B cell is first attempted at the κ locus, and that only upon failure to produce a functional κ chain is there an attempt to rearrange the λ locus; and (b) the stochastic theory, which postulates that rearrangement at the λ locus proceeds at a rate that is intrinsically much slower than that at the κ locus. We show here that λ-chain genes are generated whether or not the κ locus has lost its germ-line arrangement, a result that is compatible only with the stochastic theory...|$|E
40|$|Unlike mammals, {{chickens}} {{generate an}} immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire by a developmentally regulated process of intrachromosomal gene conversion, {{which results in}} nucleotide substitutions throughout the variable regions of the Ig heavy- and light-chain genes. In contrast to chicken Ig genes, we show in this report that diversity of the rearranged chicken T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene is generated by junctional heterogeneity, as observed in rearranged mammalian TCR genes. This junctional diversity increases during chicken development {{as a result of}} an increasing base-pair addition at the V beta-D beta and D beta-J beta joints (where V, D, and J are the variable, diversity, and <b>joining</b> <b>gene</b> segments). Despite the junctional hypervariability, however, almost all functional V beta-D beta-J beta junctions appear to encode a glycine-containing beta-turn. Such a turn may serve to position the amino acid side chains of a hypervariable TCR beta-chain loop with respect to the antigen-binding groove of the major histocompatibility complex molecule. Consistent with this hypothesis, the germ-line D beta nucleotide sequences of chickens, mice, rabbits, and humans have been highly conserved and encode a glycine in all three reading frames...|$|E
