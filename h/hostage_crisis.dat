5|$|Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The current time-line focuses on Parrish's constrained relationship with her friends while {{she is on the}} run in an attempt to prove her innocence. In the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI; in flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the current time-line, a <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> at a G-20 summit in New York City is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by Clay Haas) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiators are police {{officers}} who {{have been trained to}} respond to and resolve <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> incidents. They are often required to respond to highly-pressurised and emotive incidents that may last for protracted periods of time and are likely to encounter situations whereby their actions could play a role in whether individuals live or die. The first aim of the current thesis was to identify whether negotiators in the United Kingdom (UK) possess certain traits or characteristics that serve to enable them to perform their role effectively and differentiate them from the wider police population. The first phase of the research involved a quantitative cross-sectional comparison of a sample of <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiators (n = 117) with a sample of non-negotiator {{police officers}} (n = 118) from 21 UK forces and a sample of students (n = 203) utilising a psychometric test battery measuring five constructs previously identified within the literature as playing a role in success within occupational settings: Personality, Coping Style, Cognitive Emotion Regulation, Decision-Making Style and Emotional Intelligence. The findings refuted the existence of a “unique <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiator profile” but confirmed the existence of a unique “police officer profile” by demonstrating significant differences between both police samples and the student sample in relation to all constructs measured. These findings are discussed with reference to the implications for the selection, training and CPD of UK negotiators. <b>Hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiation is one of many options available to police incident commanders and is well-established as an effective means of resolving <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> incidents. Whilst there is a plethora of published literature relating to the entity of <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiation, the majority of this literature has been developed within the United States of America (USA), on the basis of USA negotiator deployments and experiences. The second aim, therefore, was to provide an insight into the discipline of negotiation in the UK by conducting a constructivist grounded theory analysis of the experiences of negotiators as derived from semi-structured interviews with 15 negotiators from nine UK police forces. The findings allowed for the development of five grounded theoretical micro-models: a) The Nature and Characteristics of UK <b>Hostage</b> and <b>Crisis</b> Negotiation, b) The UK <b>Hostage</b> and <b>Crisis</b> Negotiator Journey, c) The UK-Centric D. I. A. M. O. N. D. Procedural Model of <b>Hostage</b> and <b>Crisis</b> Negotiation, d) The UK <b>Hostage</b> and <b>Crisis</b> Negotiator Experience, and e) The Self-Perceived Successful UK <b>Hostage</b> and <b>Crisis</b> Negotiator Profile. These micro-models are discussed with reference to their implications for <b>hostage</b> and <b>crisis</b> negotiation policy and practice in a UK-centric context...|$|R
5|$|The 1980 presidential {{election}} featured Reagan against incumbent President Jimmy Carter and was conducted amid {{a multitude of}} domestic concerns {{as well as the}} ongoing Iran <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Reagan's campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the economy, less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis,</b> President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating the <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Alex is hired to be a member of the task force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi. The leader of the group is Clay Haas (Hunter Parrish), a renowned political advisory strategist. Prior to the formation of the task force, Alex is re-instated as an FBI agent.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis,</b> General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, {{there were}} four <b>hostage</b> <b>crises</b> where South Moluccan terrorists demanded an {{independent}} Republic of South Maluku. They held hostages in hijacked trains in 1975 and 1977, in a primary school in 1977, and in the province hall in 1978.|$|R
50|$|No {{negotiation}} with terrorists refers a policy followed by mostly Western countries to not negotiate with terrorists; this policy is often applied during <b>hostage</b> <b>crises.</b> Often {{the policy is}} limited to not paying ransom demands, and doesn't apply {{to other forms of}} negotiation.|$|R

5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by the Iran <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around a <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> and is largely presented as {{an homage to}} the film Die Hard.

5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties {{of being the first}} tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Argo is a 2012 {{political}} thriller {{directed by}} Ben Affleck, and produced by Grant Heslov, Affleck and George Clooney.

The MRTA revolutionaries who had taken the hostages were equipped with body armor, but it was defeated by the Peruvian special forces' P90s. In 2011, P90s were used by Muammar Gaddafi's military forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war, {{and some of these}} examples were captured and used in the war by Libyan rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sikkim, not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716.
