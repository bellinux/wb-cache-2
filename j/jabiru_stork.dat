50|$|In March of1972, per {{the request}} of the Belize Audibon Society and with the {{approval}} of the Government of Belize, Dr. Alexander Sprunt IV, Head of the U.S. National Audubon Society Field Office, came to Belize to assess Crooked Tree andmake recommendations about its creation as a wading bird reserve. In July he submitted his report and proposal {{for the establishment of a}} Natural Area Reserve at Crooked Tree Lagoon. <b>Jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> protection was the Belize Audubon Society’s first advocacy project. In 1973 the <b>Jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> was added to Belize’s list of protected animals. Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary, the first WildlifeSanctuary declared by the Government of Belize, was gazetted on December 8, 1984.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> is Crooked Tree’s {{most famous}} resident. Belize {{has the largest}} nesting {{population}} of these great birds in all of Central America. Jabiru storks arrive in November to nest in the lowland pine savannas. Two pairs of Jabiru storks are known to nest within the Sanctuary. After the young fledge, in April and May, the birds from the northern and central parts of Belize congregate at Crooked Tree Lagoons. When the rains come, the birds leave to return again thefollowing November.|$|E
5000|$|The first notes issued {{under its}} name were dated 1ST JULY 1983. Production of 50 dollar notes recommenced in 1990, {{the same year}} that the 1 dollar note was {{replaced}} by a coin. On April 30, 2012, the Central Bank of Belize issued a $20 commemorative note dated 01.01.12 (January 1, 2012) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Central Bank. It is similar to the current issue $20 note, but with the addition of the <b>jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> and the commemorative text [...] "30th anniversary Central Bank of Belize". On the back of the commemorative note is the headquarters of the Central Bank of Belize in Belize City.|$|E
50|$|The lagoons are {{a feeding}} area for {{hundreds}} of waterfowl including wood <b>storks,</b> endangered <b>jabiru</b> <b>storks,</b> black-bellied whistling ducks, sandpipers, and others. Many of the birds use the sanctuary as a transmigration point during their seasonal journeys.|$|R
50|$|The great {{diversity}} of the fauna {{is one of its}} great attractions: caiman, anacondas, fish, capybaras, tapirs, hyacinth macaws, herons, and <b>jabiru</b> <b>storks,</b> among others. The Pantanal received the recognition as National Patrimony in the Constitution of 1988 and as Patrimony of the Humanity and Reserve of the Biosfera from UNESCO.|$|R
2500|$|The maguari stork {{lives in}} sympatry with <b>jabiru</b> and wood <b>stork</b> where the ranges {{of these three}} species overlap, {{especially}} in the Venezuelan llanos. [...] Of all American stork species, the maguari stork has the smallest geographical range.|$|R
50|$|The Sanctuary has {{a diverse}} array of species {{including}} fish, mammal, reptile and bird population. There are 26 species of international concern within the Sanctuary and the 66-foot buffer vegetation {{on the edge of}} the lagoon. The water opossum, Yucatán howler monkey, Morlet's crocodile, American salt water crocodile, Baird's tapir, Neotropical river otter, cownose ray and the Cubera snapper can be found within or around the sanctuary. They are also 330 species of birds, including the yellow-headed parrot, the great curassow, and the <b>jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> can be seen. Several other species can be found just outside the protected are such as the jaguar, puma, margay, ocelot, jaguarundi and the Central American spider monkey.|$|E
50|$|The Belize Audubon Society {{was formed}} in 1969 by Dora Weyer {{and a group of}} conservationists. The Society was formed with a vision to inspire people to live in harmony with and benefit from the environment. The first {{president}} of the Belize Audubon Society, James A. Waight, served from 1969 until 1986. He was born in Belize City and was the Surveyor General of Belize. His dedication to the Belize Audubon Society is honored by an annual award for services to conservation in Belize called the James A. Waight Award. The Belize Audubon Society aims at conserving and protecting wildlife in Belize for the benefit of humanity and the earth's biological diversity. In 1973 the society's first launched conservation project, the <b>Jabiru</b> <b>Stork,</b> was added to Belize's list of protected species.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{determined}} nuclear and mitochondrial (mtDNA) levels of genetic variability and phylogeographic patterns in breeding populations of Roseate Spoonbill (N = 57), Wood Stork (N = 89), and <b>Jabiru</b> <b>Stork</b> (N = 30), sampled in the Brazilian Pantanal. These species were selected {{since they are}} bioindicators of wetlands health and are threatened {{in other parts of}} their distribution. As they are in close association with this ecosystem, they are appropriate for studying the effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on their demographic patterns. Levels of nuclear genetic diversity in Pantanal populations were not significantly different from those of other populations throughout the American continent, where they are considered threatened or of special concern. Reduced levels of mtDNA genetic diversity were observed in the Central American population of <b>Jabiru</b> <b>Stork</b> in comparison to the Pantanal population. Recent demographic expansion in the Pantanal was markedly evidenced by unimodal patterns of mismatch distribution and Fus Fs neutrality test in these three species. We hypothesize that the average time of population expansion (between 30, 843 and 14, 233 years before present) is associated to responses of these birds populations to paleoclimatic changes in these wetlands during the last glaciation period. We recommend special conservation efforts with the <b>Jabiru</b> <b>Stork</b> populations, a genetic monitoring program based on mtDNA, and an ecological characterization of these waterbirds species throughout their distribution range...|$|E
50|$|Mammals include capybara, tapir and deer.Bird species include jabiru (<b>Jabiru</b> mycteria), wood <b>stork</b> (Mycteria americana) , maguari stork (Ciconia maguari), spoonbill, {{great egret}} (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), {{garganey}} (Anas querquedula), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and southern screamer (Chauna torquata).|$|R
50|$|The storks {{range from}} being solitary breeders through loose {{breeding}} associations to fully colonial. The <b>jabiru,</b> Ephippiorhynchus <b>storks</b> and {{several species of}} Ciconia are entirely solitary when breeding. In contrast the Mycteria storks, Abdim's stork, openbills and Leptoptilos storks all breed in colonies which can range {{from a couple of}} pairs to thousands. Many of these species breed in colonies with other waterbirds, which can include other species of storks, herons and egrets, pelicans, cormorants and ibises. White storks, Oriental storks and Maguari storks are all loosely colonial, and may breed in nests that are within visual range of others of the same species, but {{have little to do with}} one another. They also may nest solitarily, and the reasons why they choose to nest together or apart are not understood.|$|R
50|$|Temperatures {{range from}} 16 to 34 C {{with an average}} of 26 C.Average annual {{rainfall}} is 2250 mm.The vegetation is mainly savanna-rainforest contact and pioneer fluvial forest.The reserve has rich fauna, with birds like great egret (Ardea alba), jabiru (<b>Jabiru</b> mycteria), maguari <b>stork</b> (Ciconia maguari) and Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and large animals such as black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) and porpoise.As of 2001 the reserve was home to 50 families with about 400 people whose main economic activity was fishing for food and for sale.Almost all preserve traditional artisan techniques, including the skill learned from the Indians of making canoes.|$|R
40|$|The <b>jabiru</b> <b>stork,</b> Jabiru mycteria (Lichtenstein, 1819), a large, long-legged {{wading bird}} {{occurring}} in lowland wetlands from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, is considered endangered {{in a large}} portion of its distribution range. We conducted aerial surveys to estimate the number of jabiru active nests in the Brazilian Pantanal (140, 000 km²) in September of 1991 - 1993, 1998, 2000 - 2002, and 2004. Corrected densities of active nests were regressed against the annual hydrologic index (AHI), an index of flood extension in the Pantanal based on the water level of the Paraguay River. Annual nest density was a non-linear function of the AHI, modeled by the equation 6. 5 · 10 - 8 · AHI 1. 99 (corrected r² = 0. 72, n = 7). We applied this model to the AHI between 1900 and 2004. The results indicate that the number of jabiru nests may have varied from about 220 in 1971 to more than 23, 000 in the nesting season of 1921, and the estimates for our study period (1991 to 2004) averaged about 12, 400 nests. Our model indicates that the inter-annual variations in flooding extent can determine dramatic changes in the number of active jabiru nests. Since the <b>jabiru</b> <b>stork</b> responds negatively to drier conditions in the Pantanal, direct human-induced changes in the hydrological patterns, as well as the effects of global climate change, may strongly jeopardize the population in the region...|$|E

O presente estudo determinou níveis de variabilidade nuclear e mitocondrial (DNAmit) e padrões filogeográficos de populações reprodutivas de colhereiro (N = 57), cabeça-seca (N = 89) e tuiuiú (N = 30) do Pantanal brasileiro. Estas espécies foram selecionadas porque são bioindicadoras da integridade das áreas alagáveis e se encontram ameaçadas em outras partes da sua área de distribuição. Devido à sua estreita associação com esse tipo de ecossistema, seu estudo permite verificar os efeitos das mudanças climáticas do Pleistoceno nos seus padrões demográficos. Níveis de diversidade genética nuclear nas populações pantaneiras não diferiram significativamente dos encontrados em outras populações ao longo do continente americano onde são consideradas ameaçadas ou como de especial interesse para conservação. Níveis reduzidos de variabilidade genética DNAmit foram observados nas populações de tuiuiú da América Central, quando comparadas às populações do Pantanal. A expansão demográfica recente das três espécies no Pantanal ficou marcadamente evidenciada pelos padrões unimodais da distribuição das diferenças pareadas e pelo teste de neutralidade de Fs de Fu. Hipotetizamos que o tempo médio de expansão populacional (entre 30. 843 e 14. 233 anos antes do presente) está associado as respostas destas populações de aves às mudanças climáticas ocorridas nas áreas alagáveis durante o último período de glaciação. Recomendamos, esforços especiais na conservação das populações do tuiuiú, um programa de monitoramento genético baseado no DNAmit e a caracterização ecológica dessas espécies de aves aquáticas ao longo de suas áreas de distribuição...|$|E
40|$|This chapter reviews recent {{developments}} in ornithological studies of the birds of the Pantanal. In recent years, publications from the Pantanal region increased considerably. Among those are several dissertations completed within the Pantanal Ecology Project (PEP) of the Federal University of Mato Grosso and Max-Planck-Institute, Working Group on Tropical Ecology, Germany. Bird inventories are now available from {{most parts of the}} Pantanal, though intensive and long-term sampling effort is required to obtain nearly complete species lists. However, for many rare or migratory species of the Pantanal there is still a lack of well-documented records and of informations concerning their status in the Pantanal. Studies on biology and ecology of Pantanal species are still limited, while most conservation-related publications concern two species: the Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) and the <b>Jabiru</b> <b>Stork</b> (Jabiru mycteria). The Pantanal has higher avian species richness than adjacent landscapes, which is mainly due to diverse forest bird communities, not much inferior in species numbers to Amazonian forests. The Pantanal is under the double infl uence of pronounced climatic seasons and a monomodal floodpulse, both of which show irregular long-term oscillations. This causes dynamic responses of the bird communities, which are only partially understood. The best-known feature is the breeding of aquatic birds, which is triggered by certain stages of the floodpulse. A considerable part of the avifauna are migratory species, but the complex migration strategies of Pantanal birds are still poorly known. More long-term studies on the ecology and dynamics of local bird communities, as well as bird migration studies including satellite tracking, will be necessary to better understand the avifauna of the Pantanal...|$|E
50|$|Abundant food {{could be}} readily secured {{on the grass}} plains: nutritious roots and fruit could be culled by foraging, while hunting could rely on wallaby, ducks, ibis, flying foxes jabiru and emu. The wooded hill areas abounded in iguana, snakes and opossums, while {{extensive}} stands of flowering bloodwood and messmate yielded up plentiful supplies of honey.The rivers were well stocked with fish, such as sardine-fish, Catfish, Rock cod, white fish, schnapper, barramundi and stingray, all speared from swiftly paddled canoes breasting the incoming tides and even the poor country around the Kendall river supplied rich stocks of bream. Two types of crocodile were hunted, the upper river Freshwater crocodile and the estuarine saltwater crocodile: the eggs of the former were a winter staple in the upland rivers. The roots of a coastal swamp rush called panja was an important vegetable source {{towards the end of}} the dry season. Cooking ovens were improvised by lighting a fire in a hole, fanning it to flame with feathers plucked from a black-necked <b>stork</b> (<b>jabiru).</b> Pieces of ant-bed (termite mound) were then spread on the coals, and food laid out on top, with a tea-tree bark cover placed on top, and the whole lidded with sand to make a slow bake.|$|R
