40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{as an alternative}} to catalysts in the determination of nitrogen in plant materials has been investigated. Nitrogen determination in leaf, stem and seed samples of chickpea and pigeonpea was carried out by three <b>digestion</b> <b>procedures,</b> using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 digestion) without a catalyst, and with mercury or selenium as catalysts (catalyst digestions). The nitrogen values obtained by the three <b>digestion</b> <b>procedures</b> did not differ significantly from each other when examined by microKjeldahl (MKJ) using mercury as a catalyst, and by a Technicon auto analyser (TAA) using selenium as catalyst. The gradual addition of H 2 O 2, as recommended previously, was found to be unnecessary. In view of the cost and health hazards implicated with the use of mercury and selenium for <b>digestion,</b> the <b>procedure</b> based on H 2 O 2 digestion is preferable for large scale N determinations in plant tissue and seed samples of these pulse crops.

The two procedures employed in sample preparation are the open vessel digestion, which is described in the ISO 11466 : 1995 [1], and the microwave assisted digestion, implemented in the prEN 16174 document [2]. Certified Reference Materials (NIST 2711 and BCR 141 R) were also analysed using both pre-treatment approaches in order to determine sample recoveries and assess quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) of the methods. Results obtained with samples and CRMs analysis are useful to compare the two tested <b>digestion</b> <b>procedures</b> for recovery rate, safety, cost and time taken. The results obtained from reference materials and soil samples revealed a good agreement between both procedures and the certified values.

This test demonstrates that, {{for the majority of the}} elements, the hypothesis is verified.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 119 - 126. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) {{was used}} for the {{determination}} of cadmium and beryllium in coal and fly ash slurries. Sample preparation involved grinding the sample to a fine powder and slurrying it in a suitable solvent. Stable slurries were maintained by magnetic stirring during sampling. Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes were used for cadmium determinations, while beryllium was determined with platform atomisation. Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate and magnesium nitrate matrix modifiers were used for cadmium and beryllium determinations respectively. Calibration graphs constructed with aqueous standards containing the appropriate matrix modifier were rectilinear to at least 100 pg cadmium and 45 pg beryllium. Results were calculated with integrated peak area measurements. The detection limits were 2. 9 pg for cadmium and 0. 7 pg for beryllium. Beryllium determinations were performed with semi-automatic sample introduction. The novel semi-automatic sampling unit utilised magnetic stirring for· the maintenance of stable slurries and operated with the standard Perkin-Elmer AS- 40 autosampler. The principles of this unit were extended {{to the development of a}} fully automatic auto-sampling unit. The design and operation of both units are described. The accuracy of the methods was evaluated by analysing standard reference materials and in some cases, comparisons with acid <b>digestion</b> <b>procedures.</b> Data are presented for the analysis of South African coal and fly ash samples.
