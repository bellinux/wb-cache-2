25|$|The {{debate over}} how much of Genji was {{actually}} written by Murasaki Shikibu <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> centuries and is unlikely to ever be settled unless some major archival discovery is made. It is generally accepted that the tale was finished {{in its present form}} by 1021, when the author of the Sarashina Nikki wrote a diary entry about her joy at acquiring a complete copy of the tale. She writes that there are over 50 chapters and mentions a character introduced {{at the end of the}} work, so if other authors besides Murasaki Shikibu did work on the tale, the work was done very near to the time of her writing. Murasaki Shikibu's own diary includes a reference to the tale, and indeed the application to herself of the name 'Murasaki' in an allusion to the main female character. That entry confirms that some if not all of the diary was available in 1008 when internal evidence suggests convincingly that the entry was written.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate on}} the death toll <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> many decades {{to the point where}} some historians have begun to {{question}} its usefulness on the grounds that excessive quibbling over the precise death toll has distracted from the study of other more important facets of the massacre. Daqing Yang, a historian at George Washington University, believes that [...] "an obsession with figures reduces an atrocity to abstraction and serves to circumvent a critical examination of the causes of and responsibilities for these appalling atrocities" [...] and Carol Gluck concurs that [...] "The crucial historical question remains the moral one: how could ordinary Japanese have done what they did? Numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities do not address this point." [...] However, Masahiro Yamamoto printed a rebuttal of Gluck's statement in his book Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity, arguing that [...] "To determine the extent and nature of [...] responsibility, the 'numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities,' which [...] termed as irrelevant to the moral question, are essential. Only after firmly establishing 'historical particularities' can one clearly define Japan’s responsibility. And based on a clear definition of the responsibility there can be an answer to the 'moral' question." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coca has a {{long history}} of {{cultivation}} in the Andes, and has always been a traditional part of Peruvian life. [...] However, the narcotic properties of coca were known only locally until 1786, when Lamarck listed the leaf in his botanical encyclopedia. [...] After the arrival of the Spanish, coca cultivation increased and its use became more common and widespread. [...] Since 1543, coca has been internationally recognized for its trading value, and regulations imposed upon it have attached increasing economic importance to the plant. [...] Exchange of the coca leaf between consumers in the highlands and growers in the low-lying hills <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> at least the last millennium, strengthening local economic ties. [...] Between 1884 and 1900, coca and cocaine grew in popularity for medical purposes and mass consumption in the United States. [...] From 1905 to 1922, anti-cocaine sentiments in the US resulted in criminalization of both coca and cocaine. It was not until the 1920s that US diplomats began to extend drug prohibitions internationally.|$|E
2500|$|The {{giving of}} virgin girls {{to the gods}} was part of many ancient religions. [...] In West Africa the {{practice}} <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> at least several hundred years. [...] Similar practices using similar terminology {{were found in the}} royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin), in the 18th and 19th centuries. [...] Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called [...] "ahosi", from [...] "aho" [...] meaning [...] "king", and [...] "si" [...] meaning [...] "dependent" [...] or [...] "subordinate." [...] By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey, and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women. [...] After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons. [...] The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi. [...] Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives [...] "volunteered," [...] on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come. [...] One researcher pointed out, [...] "Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word [...] "volunteered" [...] as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter. Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.|$|E

60|$|Worms live chiefly in the {{superficial}} mould, {{which is usually}} from 4 or 5 to 10 and even 12 inches in thickness; {{and it is this}} mould which passes over and over again through their bodies and is brought to the surface. But worms occasionally burrow into the subsoil to a much greater depth, and on such occasions they bring up earth from this greater depth; and this process <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> countless ages. Therefore {{the superficial}} layer of mould would ultimately attain, though at a slower and slower rate, a thickness equal to the depth to which worms ever burrow, were there not other opposing agencies at work which carry away to a lower level some of the finest earth which is continually being brought to the surface by worms. How great a thickness vegetable mould ever attains, I have not had good opportunities for observing; but in the next chapter, when we consider the burial of ancient buildings, some facts will be given on this head. In the two last chapters we shall see that the soil is actually increased, though only to a small degree, through the agency of worms; but their chief work is to sift the finer from the coarser particles, to mingle the whole with vegetable debris, and to saturate it with their intestinal secretions.|$|E
6000|$|The {{emigration}} for Fraser River <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> {{months with}} {{no signs of}} growing less. The best means of judging what grounds there are for {{the belief in the}} existence of gold in large quantities on its banks, is by letters received from persons who are engaged in mining. It is worthy of note that there is no discrepancy between the accounts given by different individuals, all their statements agreeing. The mines are reported to be exceedingly rich, and yielding large returns to those engaged in digging. The river is very high, and miners have been driven from several of the most lucrative bars until the water subsides. Mr Hill, from whom Hill's Bar took its name, is mining some distance above that point. He and six hands were making from an ounce to an ounce and a-half of gold dust a day to each man. For three weeks prior to the freshet, Mr Hill and one man averaged one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars a day. The freshet, however drove him off for the time being. Mr E.R. Collins, who has spent some time in the Fraser River gold region, and who brought down last week a quantity of dust, has communicated the following intelligence to the Alta California. Mr Collins is a trustworthy gentleman. He left San Francisco in March last, and was at Olympia when the excitement first broke out. He then, in company with three others, proceeded to Point Roberts, from whence they proceeded up Fraser River to the mouth of Harrison River, about twenty-five miles above Fort Langley. This portion of the journey they performed without guides or assistance from the natives. The current was moderate, and occasionally beautiful islands were discovered with heavy timber, which presented a beautiful appearance. From Fort Hope to Fort Yale, a distance of fifteen miles, the river runs narrow, and the current running about seven miles per hour, though, in some places, it might be set down at ten or twelve. At Fort Yale, the first mining bar was reached. It extended out from the left bank a distance of some thirty yards, and was about half a mile long. Twenty or thirty squaws were at work with baskets and wooden trays, while, near by, large numbers of male Indians stood listlessly looking on. Here some of Mr Collins' companions, who had now increased to twenty, proposed to stop and try their luck, but the majority resolved to go on, having informed themselves satisfactorily that further up the [...] "big chunks" [...] were in abundance. After resting a while, therefore, the party went ahead. Two miles from Fort Yale they entered upon the commencement of the real difficulties and dangers of navigation on Fraser River, the water for a distance of thirty-five or forty miles passing through deep gloomy canons, and over high masses of rock. At this time the river had attained only a few feet above its usual height, so that by perseverance and the skill of the native boatman they were enabled to make slow progress. Numerous portages were made--one of them, the last, being four miles long. These portages could not be avoided, the cliffs rising perpendicularly {{on either side of the}} river, sometimes to a height of fifty or sixty feet, affording not the slightest footpath on which to tow. At other places the whirls, and rocks partly submerged, rendered a water passage utterly impracticable. At every bar and shallow spot prospected in these wild localities gold was obtained in paying quantities, all of very fine quality--rather difficult to save without the use of quicksilver. From the head of the canons to the forks of Thompson's River, thirty-five miles more, the current and general appearance of the river seemed about the same as from Fort Hope to Fort Yale, gold also being found where there was an opportunity for a fair [...] "prospect". At the Forks the party were told by Travill, a French trader, whom they met by accident, that the richest and best diggings were up Thompson's; but that river being navigable but a few miles up, it was thought best to keep on up Fraser, which they did for a distance of forty miles, encountering no serious obstacles beyond a few rapids, and they were passed by towing. Five miles above the Forks some twenty white men were at work, making with common rockers from ten to sixteen dollars per day. Arriving at a bar about ten miles below, where white men were congregating in numbers considered sufficient for mutual protection, they took up a claim and commenced digging. They worked here steady twenty-four days, averaging fifteen dollars per day to each man. The greatest day's work of one man was thirty-one dollars. These figures, it is thought, would apply to all the miners.|$|E
