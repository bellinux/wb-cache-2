In case no heirs exist in the King's family, or such as may exist are held incapable by a special parliamentary decision taken by a two-thirds majority {{of the members of the}} House, Parliament shall select a successor from the line of the King's daughters or sisters, but such successor must be of Albanian origin. When there are no males in the families above mentioned, Parliament shall select a successor of Albanian origin. Should the Throne remain vacant, the Council of Ministers shall exercise the Royal powers until the question of the successor is settled.|$|R
5|$|The name <b>King</b> was <b>not</b> <b>used</b> {{again after}} the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on population growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|R
50|$|While a few {{prominent}} Icelanders, such as Benedikt Sveinsson the younger, {{wanted to}} also sever the personal {{union with the}} Danish King, the Icelanders did not seriously pursue it. It was understood that the Danish <b>King</b> would <b>not</b> <b>use</b> the veto powers afforded {{to him by the}} Act of Union, the Icelanders considered it risky to become fully independent as a small state, and it was deemed unlikely that the Danes and the Danish King would consent to the full loss of Iceland.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012, the ASA {{ruled that}} the local Northampton {{furniture}} store Sofa <b>King</b> could <b>not</b> <b>use</b> a tagline stating that their prices were [...] "Sofa King low" [...] {{because it would be}} considered [...] "likely to cause serious and widespread offense", due to its use of a pun based on a profanity. Sofa King's owner disputed these claims, saying that he had run print advertisements in a local newspaper containing the offending slogan for ten years without any complaints, and compared the situation to FCUK being banned from using their name in such a fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} of the Danish monarch {{as the head of}} the military is deeply rooted in tradition. While the 1953 constitution does not explicitly designate the monarch as commander-in-chief; it is implicit, given the general provision in article 12 and the more specific wording of article 19 (2): [...] "Except for purposes of defence against an armed attack upon the Realm or Danish forces, the <b>King</b> shall <b>not</b> <b>use</b> military force against any foreign state without the consent of the Folketing. Any measure which the King may take in pursuance of this provision shall forthwith be submitted to the Folketing".|$|R

[...] The {{incident was}} then reported in U.S. in the November 9, 1990, edition of the Wall Street Journal, under the title of [...] "To Their Dismay, King Scholars Find a Troubling Pattern". Several other newspapers then followed with stories, including the Boston Globe and the New York Times. Although Carson believed King had acted unintentionally, he also stated that King had been sufficiently well acquainted with academic principles and procedures to have understood the need for extensive footnotes, and {{he was at a}} loss to explain why <b>King</b> had <b>not</b> <b>used</b> them.|$|R
5000|$|Today, English is {{the only}} Germanic {{language}} to productively use [...] "hard" [...] (outside of the digraph [...] ) rather than [...] (although Dutch uses it in loaned words of Latin origin, and the pronunciation of these words follows the same hard/soft distinction as in English). The letter [...] is usually silent {{at the start of}} an English word when it comes before the letter , as in the words [...] "knight," [...] "knife," [...] "knot," [...] "know," [...] and [...] "knee".

(The story also involves Harry's rivalry with the similarly gifted but jealous Benedetto.

40|$|This study {{compared}} cross-language speech {{perception of}} vowel length contrasts in Arabic and Japanese by {{two groups of}} listeners whose first language (L 1) was either Cantonese (C) or Korean (K). Unlike Arabic or Japanese, C and <b>K</b> do <b>not</b> <b>use</b> vowel length contrastively. One group (CK+J) had experience learning Japanese as a foreign language while the other (CK) did not. The question of interest was if Japanese learning experience separated the two groups in their perception of Arabic as well as Japanese vowel length contrasts. The effect of learning Japanese was negligible for CK+J {{who participated in this}} study. Further, it appeared that learning Japanese had a somewhat negative effect on the listeners’ perception of Arabic contrasts. The pattern of results obtained may reflect a temporary and transient nature of listeners’ interlanguage and has implications for adults’ speech learning capabilities. 4 page(s...|$|R

The {{regiment}} returned to Britain in 1666 On 30 June 1667, Samuel Pepys met the Lord George in Rochester and mentions seeing his Regiment, by then known as [...] "Dumbarton's Regiment" [...] (later the Royal Scots), and notes it his diary.When the regiment was recalled to France, the officers presented a petition to the King to use his influence on the French <b>King</b> <b>not</b> to <b>use</b> them for any service distasteful to them. The regiment returned to Crown service finally in 1669 serving in the English Army, and was fully incorporated by 1678. In 1675 in recognition of Lord George 's effort in the recent Third Anglo-Dutch War, Charles II created Lord George, Earl of Dumbarton and Lord Douglas of Ettrick, a titular dignity there was no entail of land in Scotland with the creation.|$|R
60|$|But the King {{had long}} since made {{arrangements}} to capture the dragon, whenever he might appear. No sooner did Quox stick {{his head into the}} room than a thick chain fell from above and encircled his neck. Then the ends of the chain were drawn tight--for in an adjoining cavern a thousand nomes were pulling on them--and so the dragon could advance no further toward the <b>King.</b> He could <b>not</b> <b>use</b> his teeth or his claws and as his body was still in the passage he had not even room to strike his foes with his terrible tail.|$|R

The Prince thought all the rooms looked strangely old-fashioned, with their antique furniture, but as there was a good library he was pleased, for he was very fond of reading, and he soon got {{permission}} to have as many books as he liked. But when he looked at them he found that they were written in a forgotten language, and he could not understand a single word, though he amused himself with trying.|$|R
40|$|Copolymers of styrene and {{acrylonitrile}} {{have been}} γ-irradiated at 77 and 300 K. At 300 K, the copolymers display significant radiation protection effects {{in terms of}} the formation of radicals observed by ESR spectroscopy. These protection effects have been related to the copolymer sequence structure; in particular next neighbour interactions. At 77 K, no protection is observed in the total radical yields across the copolymer composition range. Radiolysis of these copolymers at 77 <b>K</b> could <b>not</b> be <b>used</b> to provide mechanistic information about the radiolysis of the copolymers at room temperature as annealing of the irradiated copolymers from 77 to 300 <b>K</b> did <b>not</b> yield the same ESR spectra as those for irradiations of the copolymers at 300 K.

50|$|Covering {{battles in}} North Africa, Italy and Crete, this last {{incarnation}} of the CM series using the original game engine, features much improved graphics over Beyond Overlord. Included are 3D models with many more polygons, and subtler effects such as dust clouds. Multi-turret vehicles are introduced though weapons in separate weapon mounts still cannot target separately. Included nationalities are British, American, German, Italian, Canadian, Polish, Australian, New Zealand, French and South African, with dates ranging from late 1940 to May 1945. Afrika Korps {{can also be used}} to play Western Front battles (i.e. Beyond Overlord battles) with the newest graphics and updated order menu, but without the full range of vehicles, as some German tanks (such as the <b>King</b> Tiger) were <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in Africa or Italy.|$|R
40|$|Sparcle is a {{processor}} chip developed jointly by MIT, LSI Logic, and SUN Microsystems, by evolving an existing RISC architecture towards {{a processor}} suited for large-scale multiprocessors. Sparcle supports three multiprocessor mechanisms: fast context switching, fast, user-level message handling, and fine-grain synchronization. The Sparcle effort demonstrates that RISC architectures {{coupled with a}} communications and memory management unit do not require major architectural changes to support multiprocessing efficiently. 1 Introduction The Sparcle chip will clock at no more than 50 MHz, has no more than 200 <b>K</b> transistors, does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> the latest technologies, and dissipates a paltry 2 Watts. It has no on-chip cache, no fancy pads, and only 207 pins. It does not even support multiple-instruction issue. Then why do we think this chip is interesting? Sparcle is a processor chip designed to support large-scale multiprocessing. We designed its mechanisms and interfaces to provide fast messag [...] ...|$|R
500|$|In Peter Jackson's film trilogy (2001–2003), Saruman is {{significantly}} {{more active in}} the first two films than in their equivalent books, and he appears in several scenes that are not depicted in Tolkien's work. In the films, Saruman is depicted presenting himself outright as a servant of Sauron. Smith and Matthews suggest that Saruman's role is built up as a substitute for Sauron—the story's main antagonist—who never appears directly in the book. Jackson confirms this view in the commentary to the DVD. They also suggest that having secured veteran British horror actor Christopher Lee to play Saruman, it made sense to make greater use of his star status. Despite this increased role {{in the first two}} films, the scenes involving Saruman that were shot for use in the third film, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the <b>King,</b> were <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the cinematic release, a decision which [...] "shocked" [...] Lee. Jackson reasoned that it would be anticlimactic to show Saruman's fate in the second movie (after the Battle of Helm's Deep) and too retrospective for it to be in the third one. The cut scenes end with Saruman falling to his death from the top of Orthanc after being stabbed by Wormtongue and include material from the chapter The Scouring of the Shire. They are included {{at the start of the}} Extended Edition DVD release of the film.|$|R
40|$|Heme, a major iron source, is transported {{through the}} outer {{membrane}} of Gram-negative bacteria by specific heme/hemoprotein receptors {{and through the}} inner membrane by heme-specific, periplasmic, binding protein-dependent, ATP-binding cassette permeases. Escherichia coli <b>K</b> 12 does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> exogenous heme, and no heme uptake genes have been identified. Nevertheless, a recombinant E. coli strain expressing just one foreign heme outer membrane receptor can use exogenous heme as an iron source. This result suggests either that heme {{might be able to}} cross the cytoplasmic membrane in the absence of specific carrier or that there is a functional inner membrane heme transporter. Here, we show that to use heme iron E. coli requires the dipeptide inner membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter (DppBCDF) and either of two periplasmic binding proteins: MppA, the l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate binding protein, or DppA, the dipeptide binding protein. Thus, wild-type E. coli has a peptide/heme permease despite being unable to use exogenous heme. DppA, which shares sequence similarity with the Haemophilus influenzae heme-binding protein HbpA, and MppA are functional heme-binding proteins. Peptides compete with heme for binding both “in vitro” and “in vivo. ...|$|R

The blazon was azure, a harp or string argent, as appears by the great embroidered banner, and at the funeral of Queen Anne, King James' queen, AD 1618, and likewise by the great banner and banner of Ireland at the funeral of King James. The difference between the arms and device of Ireland appears to be on the crown only, which is added to the harp when used as a device.At the funeral of King James was likewise carried the standard of the crest of Ireland, a buck proper (argent in the draught) issuing from a tower triple towered or, which is the only instance of this crest that I have met, and therefore was probably devised and assigned for the crest of Ireland upon occasion of this funeral, but with what propriety I do not understand.
