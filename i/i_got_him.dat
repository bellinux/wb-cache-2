25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had made enough already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon we ended up just about square.|$|E
500|$|Jason Maguire (Ballabriggs, 1st): [...] "He loved it... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to {{the front}} to get him relaxed and put {{breathers}} into him and that helped him get the trip." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, which explores John Doggett's backstory as a New York City police officer, was {{described}} as containing similar themes as those [...] "explored on the Millennium series." [...] The episode guest-starred Arthur Nascarella, who {{was a friend of}} series co-star Robert Patrick. Patrick was essential in getting Nascarella cast on the show; he later joked [...] "I stole [...] New York accent in Copland [...] and I stole it to do The X-Files, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> cast in The X-Files show." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Kybird nodded gloomily. [...] "'Melia and Jack don't seem to 'ave been 'itting it off partikler well lately," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "He's {{getting more}} uppish than wot 'e was when 'e come here first. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>'im</b> to promise that he'd settle any money that 'e might ever get left him on 'Melia." ...|$|R
500|$|Heath {{played in}} the minors the {{following}} season before eventually rejoining the Braves during the 1949 season. In a game on 28 August, Heath helped tie the Cincinnati Reds with a {{home run in the}} ninth inning and helped win the game for the Braves with another in the 10th inning. He ended his final major league season after 36 games into the 1949 season. He batted [...]306 with nine homers and 23 RBIs. In October 1949, the Braves placed Heath on waivers and general manager John Quinn offered him a managing position with a team in the Braves farm system, but he never accepted Quinn's offer to manage. Baseball historian Bill James when summarizing the 1940s listed Heath as the recipient for his designation of [...] "A Better Ballplayer Than a Human Being." [...] Southworth said, [...] "They told me when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> from the American League that Heath was a troublemaker. If he is, I'd sure like to have eight other troublemakers like him." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not have}} to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was {{successful}} against English fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one occasion, O'Reilly held his head in his hands when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: [...] "Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!" [...] In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying [...] "You just check how many times <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out!" [...] The cricket historian David Frith points out that [...] "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." [...] Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: [...] "His element was foul weather. He would disappear into the haze of Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} rise {{from his chair and}} reach his sword, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> between <b>him</b> and the corner where it lay.|$|R

500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{left the}} HCIS in March 1973 {{and joined the}} United States Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Watergate Committee) as the Deputy Minority Counsel. One of Sanders' {{responsibilities}} was to gather evidence by interviewing officials and aides {{to find out more}} information about the Watergate break-in. The most famous of these interviews occurred on Friday, July 13, 1973. Alexander Butterfield (Federal Aviation Administration head and a former White House aide) was being privately questioned by Senate committee staff members, when Sanders asked if it were possible that a recording system had been used in the White House. Butterfield answered: [...] "I wish you hadn't asked that question, but, yes, there is." [...] Sanders went to relay the news to Fred Thompson, who was the Minority Counsel. Sanders first had to call him out of a local restaurant. [...] "Because he was with some reporters, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> away from them, and got him out on the street corner and told him the story", Sanders said.|$|E
2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his mind that I was his friend. He knew he was in very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state when you say the subject is cataleptic. The longer you keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E

"I took ’im by the sleeve, {{and he gets}} up quiet an’ obedient and follers me like {{a little}} child. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>’im</b> {{straight}} into ’is bunk, an’ arter a time he fell into a soft slumber, an’ I thought the worst had passed, but I was mistaken. He got up in three hours’ time an’ seemed all right, ’cept that he walked about {{as though he was}} thinking very hard about something, an’ before I could make out what it was he had a fit.|$|R
50|$|His credits as cinematographer include Major Barbara (1941), In Which We Serve (1942), This Happy Breed (1944), and Blithe Spirit (1945). His camera work on One of Our Aircraft <b>Is</b> Missing <b>got</b> <b>him</b> an Academy Award {{nomination}} for Best Special Effects in 1943.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Got him! Oh, haven't <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him!</b> Have <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> though?' cried Mr Snawley, {{scarcely}} able {{to believe}} it. 'Yes, here he is, flesh and blood, flesh and blood.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'There is this. You {{forget that}} I had the {{opportunity}} to steal Ogden if I had wanted to. <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>him</b> away to London. But I brought him back. I did it because you had told me what it meant to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Duke {{is rather}} brisk. <b>I</b> {{actually}} <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out shooting yesterday, but he didn't half like it, and was thankful when I {{let him go}} home again. See, Sydney said I was {{to tell you that}} passion-flower came from the plant she brought from Algiers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he went on}} taunting {{us about}} old times, and {{especially}} reminding me that <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>him</b> a thrashing, over breaking the school house window.

6000|$|Not at all. One of {{the suite}} overheard, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> round <b>him.</b> There [...] was much more, which I did not learn. But {{they are going}} to soothe [...] and flatter the unfortunate King and Queen by asking them to a banquet [...] here.|$|R

5000|$|After the Blue Thumb {{recording}} session, Hooker and {{his band}} backed his cousin John Lee Hooker {{on a series of}} club dates in California, after which John Lee used them for a recording session for Bluesway Records.

25|$|From 1725 {{he lived}} in Warsaw, Poland, where he caught the {{attention}} of German architect and draughtsman Colonel Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann, for whom he worked for several years.

6000|$|As I {{remember}} them together they chafed constantly. Her attitude to nearly all his moods {{and all his}} enterprises was a sceptical disapproval.
