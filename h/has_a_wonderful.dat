25|$|A Mazatlán opera-lover and journalist, {{who watched}} Peralta rehearsing in the Teatro Rubio on 22 August 1883, {{wrote in his}} diary: She is a woman with an {{agreeable}} presence, slightly obese, with bulging but very lively eyes. She <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> voice that produces notes from the very highest to the lowest with astounding ease; she sang several variations with such delicate notes, like the trill of a goldfinch...|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> {{beautiful}} face, a high forehead, prominent over the eyes; a long delicate nose, with little, red, nostrils; a strange mouth, never still & quite elusive; a square chin, slightly cleft in the middle — the whole face pale; the eyes grey-blue; the hair golden-brown, and curling in soft wavy crinkles. Large grotesque eyes, with long, well-shaped fingers and beautiful nails.|$|E
500|$|Parr took Bury {{upstairs to}} see Lieutenant David Lamb, {{the head of}} the detective department. Parr told Lamb, [...] "This man <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> story to tell you." [...] Bury retold his story to Lamb, but omitted the {{reference}} to Jack the Ripper, and added that he had stabbed his wife's body once. Bury was searched, and a small knife, bankbook and his house key were confiscated pending inquiries. Lamb and Detective Constable Peter Campbell proceeded to the Burys' dingy flat, where they discovered the mutilated remains of Ellen stuffed into the wooden box Bury had commissioned in London.|$|E

[...] Middleton arrived in Columbus, Georgia with strong praise from his superiors, and would soon get his efficiency report, in which Brigadier General Benjamin Poore of the 4th Division wrote of him, [...] "The best all-around officer I have yet seen. Unspoiled by his rapid promotion from captain in July to colonel in October; and made good in every grade.

500|$|Kamin also {{praises the}} design of the {{proscenium}} and the venue's sightlines and acoustics, which also drew praise from Tribune journalist Howard Reich and Chicago Sun-Times journalist Wynne Delacoma. Reich, who notes that the theater <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> stage, describes the theater as a blessing for both audiences and arts organizations because its high-profile confers [...] "instant prominence and credibility to musicians and presenters". Reich feels it is a less than perfect jazz music venue because of its [...] "cavernous" [...] size and high rental cost ($4,750 in 2008, plus costs for stagehands). Nonetheless, Delacoma describes it as [...] "an astonishingly beautiful place to listen to music. Its acoustics cradle sound like a velvet-lined jewel box." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Caine as John Cutter, {{the stage}} {{engineer}} (ingenieur) {{who works with}} Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan said that even though {{it felt like the}} character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows you to have a point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although American {{women have}} made {{significant}} strides in the workplace, {{they are still}} culturally and socially required to be mothers first and foremost. The cultural ideas of motherhood in the U.S. have {{given birth to a}} new ideal: a working mother who not only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> career but also manages to flawlessly balance her family and domestic duties as well. This ideal is known as the [...] "supermom." [...] The media is a culprit in this depiction: A study examining the portrayal of mothers in magazines showed that the most popular magazines in the U.S. still continue to promote the traditional role of motherhood while undermining homemakers by portraying them as superficial and negative. Instead, only the Supermom type is portrayed and rarely critiqued.|$|E
