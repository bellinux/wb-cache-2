5|$|The Wu secured Xiangyang, the Nan Territory, Jiangling, and Jing Province from Wei before Shu's Zhuge Liang could, {{and also}} {{defeated}} Meng Huo <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> (<b>or</b> third) {{time in the}} south. Their final battle against Shu is at Yiling, where they use a fire attack to force Liu Bei to retreat to Bai Di Castle, where he is then defeated (or killed). If Wei has fallen first, Wu will defeat the Shu at Chengdu and occupy the lands of Shu Han, killing their officers.|$|E
25|$|The most {{promising}} candidates {{are invited to}} return <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers {{may be asked to}} sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a test week, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.|$|E
25|$|Batsmen are {{required}} to retire upon reaching a pre-agreed personal score, usually 25 or 30. Should the side be dismissed {{with a number of}} batsmen retired, they may then return to the crease in the order they retired. It is not unprecedented for a batsman to retire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> even third time in one innings. This rule ensures that the majority of a team will get a bat, and hence ensures the emphasis on the entire team both getting involved and being able to contribute to the final score.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd {{concluded}} that the sucking action produced by the excretion {{of water from the}} bladder was sufficient to draw larger soft-bodied prey into the trap without the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> further touch to the trigger levers. An animal long enough not to be fully engulfed upon first springing the trap, but thin and soft enough to allow the door to return fully to its set position, would indeed be left partly outside the trap until it or another body triggered the mechanism once again. However, the capture of hard bodies not fully drawn into the trap would prevent its further operation.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there was}} {{considerable}} support for Australia's involvement in Vietnam, and all Australian battalions returning from Vietnam participated in well attended welcome home parades through either Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane or Townsville, even during the early 1970s. Regardless, as {{opposition to the war}} increased service in Vietnam came to be seen by sections of the Australian community in less than sympathetic terms and opposition to it generated negative views of veterans in some quarters. In the years following the war, some Vietnam veterans experienced social exclusion and problems readjusting to society. Nevertheless, as the tour of duty of each soldier during the Vietnam War was limited to one year (although some soldiers chose to sign up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> even a third tour of duty), the number of soldiers suffering from combat stress was probably more limited than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the automatic gain control (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|E

25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team {{to get control of}} the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to the}} puck (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} of this seeming unlikely pair caused a scandal throughout the Empire. [...] At 27-years-of-age, Gebhard had apparently abjured the matrimonial {{life in his}} acceptance of the church career often reserved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> third son of noble families. If he had converted to Lutheranism and resigned from his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, the marriage {{might have made a}} ripple in social circles, but his refusal to give up his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, his declaration of the electorate as henceforth a dynastic property, however, made his {{marriage of}} utmost political importance. Furthermore, his conversion to Calvinism was heresy, because Calvinism was not one of the two legal professions of faith accepted by the Peace of Augsburg in 1556.|$|E

2500|$|The catcher {{can help}} his pitcher get more strike {{calls from the}} umpire by using a {{technique}} called [...] "framing". This practice {{is a matter of}} a catcher keeping his mitt inside the strike zone, or making the pitch appear as close to the strikezone, when receiving the pitch, thereby giving the plate umpire the impression that the pitch is in the strike zone, even if it is not. When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> two so that the umpire has an opportunity to thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).|$|E

[...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>or</b> two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant.
