50|$|Flash {{is based}} on the {{floating}} gate concept, essentially a modified transistor. Conventional flash transistors have three connections, the source, drain and gate. The gate is the essential component of the transistor, controlling the resistance between the source and drain, and thereby acting as a switch. In the floating <b>gate</b> <b>transistor,</b> the gate is attached to a layer that traps electrons, leaving it switched on (or off) for extended periods of time. The floating gate can be re-written by passing a large current through the emitter-collector circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Bower’s {{invention}} underwent {{much controversy}} when Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace {{argued that they}} were the actual inventors of the self-aligned gate transistors. In 1966, Bower and Dill presented the first publication the self-aligned <b>gate</b> <b>transistor</b> at the International Electron Device Meeting in Washington D.C.. That IEDM publication described the self-aligned <b>gate</b> <b>transistor</b> fabricated with both metal and polysilicon as the gate material and using both ion implantation and diffusion to form the source and drains. This was presentation 16.6 of this IEDM meeting. To Bower and to the attorneys who litigated the Bower U.S. 3,472,712 patent it was determined in the courts that his patent covered the general principal of using a gate as mask for both metal and polysilicon gates using ion implantation to establish the source and drain regions. Bower does not acknowledge the statement [...] "Although Bower believed he was first in using aluminum as the gate and later developed the device using polysilicon as the gate, he was unable to prove it to the courts and the patent was awarded to Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace (U.S. 3,475,234)" [...] is true. Actually it was the Hans G. Dill patent U.S. 3,544,3999, filed on October 26, 1966 that described the formation of the polysilicon gate self-aligned gate FET using diffusion of the source and drain that was disputed by the Kerwin et al. patent, not the Bower patent. It was also determined in a number of court cases {{that the vast majority of}} self-aligned gate FETs were made using ion implantation rather than diffusion to introduce the dopants into the source-drain regions. Bower conferred with the attorneys who litigated these cases and they confirmed that the statement [...] "The US patent system grants the patent to the first developer of the invention, not the first one to be issued a patent." [...] is not a valid statement of patent law.|$|E
50|$|However, in a {{legal action}} {{involving}} Bower and Dill, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Kerwin, Klein and Sarace were the true inventors of the self-aligned silicon <b>gate</b> <b>transistor.</b> On that basis, they were awarded the basic patent US 3,475,234 (the US patent system awards the basic patent to the party that first makes the invention, not the party that first files a patent application, per rules at that time). Bower's work described the self-aligned-gate MOSFET, made with both aluminum and polysilicon gates. It used both ion implantation and diffusion to form the source and drain using the gate electrode as the mask to define the source and drain regions. The Bell Labs team attended this meeting of the IEDM in 1966, and they discussed this work with Bower after his presentation in 1966. Bower believed he had first made the self-aligned gate using aluminum as the gate and, before presentation in 1966, made the device using polysilicon as the gate. However, {{he was not able}} to prove it to the appellate court, who sided with the Bell Labs team.|$|E

Recently there has been a surge of interest to introduce a new generation of memory devices using graphene nanotechnology. In this paper we present a new floating <b>gate</b> <b>transistor</b> (FGT) design based on multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) and carbon nanotube (CNT). In the proposed FGT a multilayer structure of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) would be used as the channel of the field effect transistor (FET) and a layer of CNTs would be used as the floating gate.

40|$|The double <b>gate</b> <b>transistor</b> is a {{promising}} device applicable to deep sub-micron design {{due to its}} inherent resistance to short-channel effects and superior subthreshold performance.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on thin film {{transistors}} based on gas phase synthesized ZnO nanoparticles using low temperature deposited silicon dioxide and silicon nitride as gate dielectrica. For bottom <b>gate</b> <b>transistors,</b> the devices using silicon nitride as gate insulator show the lowest off-current for a given induced charge and the steepest subthreshold slope. The charge carrier mobility of around 3 x 10 - 3 cm 2 /Vs and an Ion/Ioff ratio of around 105 are almost independent of the insulator material. In a double <b>gated</b> thin film <b>transistor</b> using low stress silicon nitride as top <b>gate</b> insulator, <b>transistor</b> parameters are extracted for the identical semiconducting layer when the bottom gate is used and when the top gate is used, respectively.
