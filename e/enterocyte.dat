5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the <b>enterocyte.</b> Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

40|$|In {{hereditary}} hemochromatosis (HH), intestinal {{absorption of}} dietary iron is increased, leading to excessive iron accumulation in tissues and resultant organ damage. The HFE protein, which is defective in HH, normally {{is expressed in}} crypt <b>enterocytes</b> of the duodenum where it has a unique, predominantly intracellular localization. In placenta, the HFE protein colocalizes with and forms a stable association with the transferrin receptor (TfR), providing {{a link between the}} HFE protein and iron transport. In the present study, we examined the relationship of the HFE protein to the TfR in <b>enterocytes</b> of the human duodenum and measured the uptake of transferrin-bound iron and ionic iron by isolated crypt and villus <b>enterocytes.</b> Immunocytochemistry showed that the HFE protein and TfR both are expressed in the crypt <b>enterocytes.</b> Western blots showed that, {{as was the case in}} human placenta, the HFE protein in crypt <b>enterocytes</b> is physically associated with the TfR and with β 2 -microglobulin. The crypt cell fraction exhibited dramatically higher transferrin-bound iron uptake than villus cells. On the other hand, the villus cells showed 2 – 3 times higher uptake of ionic iron than crypt cells. We propose that the HFE protein modulates the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by crypt <b>enterocytes</b> and participates in the mechanism by which the crypt <b>enterocytes</b> sense the level of body iron stores. Impairment of this function caused by HFE gene mutations in HH could provide a paradoxical signal in crypt <b>enterocytes</b> that programs the differentiating <b>enterocytes</b> to absorb more dietary iron when they mature into villus <b>enterocytes...</b>|$|R

As prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) increases intracellular cAMP concentrations via its receptor subtypes EP 2 R and EP 4 R, it was investigated whether PGE 2 could enhance intestinal glucose absorption.  METHODS—The action of PGE 2 on carbohydrate absorption in the ex situ perfused rat small intestine and on 3 -O-[14 C]methylglucose uptake in isolated villus tip <b>enterocytes</b> was determined. Expression of mRNA for the PGE 2 receptor subtypes 1 - 4 was assayed in <b>enterocytes</b> by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  RESULTS—In the perfused small intestine, PGE 2 acutely increased absorption of glucose and galactose, but not fructose (which is not a substrate for SGLT 1); in isolated <b>enterocytes</b> it stimulated 3 -O-[14 C]methylglucose uptake. The 3 -O-[14 C]methylglucose uptake could be inhibited by the cAMP antagonist RpcAMPS and the specific inhibitor of SGLT 1, phlorizin. High levels of EP 2 R mRNA and EP 4 R mRNA were detected in villus tip <b>enterocytes.</b>  CONCLUSION—PGE 2 acutely increased glucose and galactose absorption by the small intestine via the SGLT 1, with cAMP serving as the second messenger.
