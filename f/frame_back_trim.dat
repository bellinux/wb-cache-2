The techniques involved in creating computer-generated imagery are conversely generally removed from a frame-by-frame process.|$|R

Robin observed him furtively as he trimmed his staff, measuring him from top to toe from out {{the corner of his}} eye, and thought that he had never seen a lustier or a stouter man. Tall was Robin, but taller was the stranger by a head and a neck, for he was seven feet in height.

30|$|After being decoded, the {{different}} bitplanes are recombined {{to form the}} quantization symbols. These symbols and the side information are used to reconstruct the DCT coefficients. An optimal reconstruction function is proposed in [20] to minimize the mean squared error according to the Laplacian correlation model. For coefficient bands {{that have not been}} transmitted, the side information is directly considered in the reconstruction. Finally, an inverse 4 × 4 DCT is applied to the reconstructed DCT band to restore the WZ <b>frame</b> <b>back</b> in the pixel domain.|$|R
50|$|When editing 24pA footage, {{conversion}} from 60i back to {{the original}} 24p is very efficient. It only requires blending the fields made from the <b>frames</b> <b>back</b> into full <b>frames.</b> Then, only every fifth frame will be made up of fields from two different frames, and that frame can be discarded, leaving only the other four full frames. In order for this to work properly, the DVX100 camera records video in chunks of five video frames. This ensures that each clip has regular and predictable cadence.|$|R
