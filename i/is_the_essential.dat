Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E

25|$|The {{operator}} norm of T <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> supremum of h. The essential {{range of}} h {{is defined in}} the following way: a complex number λ is in the essential range of h if for all ε > 0, the preimage of the open ball Bε(λ) under h has strictly positive measure. We will show first that σ(Th) coincides with the essential range of h and then examine its various parts.|$|E
25|$|We {{conclude}} that the function ψ {{is the value of}} the minimizing integral A {{as a function of the}} upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> content of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which applies to more general variational problems.|$|E

25|$|The Whitehead {{group of}} a free abelian group is trivial, a 1964 result of Bass, Heller and Swan. This is quite hard to prove, but is {{important}} as it {{is used in the}} proof that an s-cobordism of dimension at least 6 whose ends are tori is a product. It is also the key algebraic result used in the surgery theory classification of piecewise linear manifolds of dimension at least 5 which are homotopy equivalent to a torus; this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> ingredient of the 1969 Kirby–Siebenmann structure theory of topological manifolds of dimension at least 5.|$|E
25|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ ions into astrocytes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> change that {{ultimately}} generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly {{caused by an}} increase in blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said {{to be a kind of}} hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E
25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to {{lend support to the}} theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E

25|$|Oxygen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> {{component}} for any breathing gas, at {{a partial}} pressure of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 {{bar at the}} ambient pressure. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases. Most breathing gases therefore are a mixture of oxygen and one or more inert gases. Other breathing gases {{have been developed to}} improve on the performance of ordinary air by reducing the risk of decompression sickness, reducing the duration of decompression stops, reducing nitrogen narcosis or allowing safer deep diving.|$|E
25|$|The human target <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the , in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.|$|E

Treatment not only {{increases}} oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.|$|E
500|$|The English word {{nitrogen}} (1794) {{entered the}} language from the French nitrogène, coined in 1790 by French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756–1832), from the French nitre (potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter) and the French -gène, [...] "producing", from the Greek -γενής (-genes, [...] "producer, begetter"). Chaptal's meaning was that nitrogen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> part of nitric acid, {{which in turn}} was produced from niter. In earlier times, niter had been confused with Egyptian [...] "natron" [...] (sodium carbonate) — called νίτρον (nitron) in Greek — which, despite the name, contained no nitrate.|$|E

500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> medium {{by which a}} poet of genius operates {{on the minds of}} his audience. When the author instills in the reader or viewer's imagination the sense of power that he must have had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in ourselves the way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E
500|$|With Darwin's theory, {{a general}} {{acceptance}} quickly appeared that a classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of common descent. Tree of Life representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One {{of the first}} modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was birds. Using the then newly discovered fossils of Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis, Thomas Henry Huxley pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by Richard Owen in 1842. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs [...] "giving rise to" [...] or being [...] "the ancestors of" [...] birds, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups.|$|E
500|$|As feminist {{literary}} critic Susan Gubar argues, Mary Shelley's drama {{is part of}} a female literary tradition, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, H.D., Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Doris Lessing, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a [...] "way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood....they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself." [...] Poets such as Dorothy Wellesley, Rachel Annand Taylor, Babette Deutsch, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge [...] "the divisions between self and other" [...] that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich writes that [...] "the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> female tragedy", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.|$|E
