40|$|AbstractThe defect {{parameters}} of isolated Cri and chromium-boron (CrB) pairs are reassessed by conducting lifetime spectroscopy on both n- and p-type, Cr-doped silicon samples with different doping levels, and fitting the lifetimes with the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) model. The uncertainty ranges of the parameters are significantly tightened through a combined {{analysis of the}} two defects with the lifetime data measured on both n- and p-type samples. Both the experimental data and the modelling results suggest that Cri has a greater negative impact on lifetimes in p-Si than n-Si. The possible hydrogen passivation of Cri in n- and p-Si is then investigated both through charge state modelling and experimentally. A <b>general</b> <b>occupancy</b> factor is applied to predict the charge states of both monovalent Cri and multivalent H {{as a function of}} temperature and injection level. The modelling results suggest that above 800 K, both the injection and the doping become unimportant as silicon becomes intrinsic. However, despite some positive hints, the experimental evidence for hydrogenation of Cri is inconclusive at this stage...|$|E

We used metagene to investigate the differential occupancy of regulatory factors at noncoding regulatory regions (promoters and enhancers) in relation to transcriptional activity in GM 12878 B-lymphocytes.

Characterizing Bd’s host range is important for understanding community disease dynamics, predicting further declines, minimizing the cost of surveillance and developing pre-emptive management actions. In this study, we integrated ametric of potential host exposure to the pathogen (derived from spatial models of environmental suitability for Bd) with host species’ life-history and ecological traits to identify risk factors associated with Bd infection in our model system (Australia).

Furthermore, the likelihood of powered-two-wheelers (PTWs) involvement in an accident is examined. To achieve {{the aims of the}} study, traffic and accident data during the period 2006 – 2011 from two major arterials in Athens were collected and processed. Firstly, a finite mixture cluster analysis was implemented to classify traffic into clusters. Afterwards, discriminant analysis was carried out in order to correctly assign new cases to the existing regimes by using a training and a testing set.

40|$|Amphibians are {{of great}} {{conservation}} concern due to alarming population declines worldwide. Their unique and specific biological needs make them especially sensitive to environmental changes. These vulnerable ectotherms {{are threatened by}} habitat loss and degradation, especially in the Midwestern United States. In Indiana, loss of over 85 % of the state’s natural wetlands has resulted in multiple species declines, including two species of special concern, the Northern Leopard Frog, Lithobates pipiens, and the Blanchard’s Cricket Frog, Acris blanchardi. Fortunately, efforts to restore wetland habitat can mitigate some aspects of habitat loss, but effective sampling techniques and suitable analytical approaches are needed to accurately measure the quality and functionality of the restored habitat. ^ Occupancy and habitat use of amphibians inhabiting a 716 acre restored wetland system in Fort Wayne, Indiana was measured in 2013 and 2014 to assess restoration status and habitat quality. Two types of survey methods—call surveys and tadpole surveys—were used to compare amphibian presence and absence among the different wetlands in the preserve. Most species occupied both established and restored wetlands, {{with the exception of}} the Unisexual Ambystoma Salamander and the Small-mouthed Salamander, which only bred in forested, established wetlands. Habitat use was species–specific and largely driven by species biology. The two species of special concern had opposite responses to the restoration. Colonization and reproductive success was highest in the Northern Leopard Frog, while occupancy of the Blanchard’s Cricket Frog remained low. However, Blanchard’s Cricket Frogs colonized the restored wetland complex for the first time in 2014. In <b>general,</b> <b>occupancy</b> of larval amphibians in 2014 was low. Method comparison revealed that for the majority of species, occupancy of calling males did not accurately predict occupancy of tadpoles. ^ Management decisions may be best suited to focus on wetlands where species are successfully reproducing, and not solely on where they are heard calling. Special attention should also be given to promoting and maintaining shallow ponds with short hydroperiods, as these ponds supported higher species richness and occupancy probability of tadpoles. These ponds were also the first to dry, often before successful metamorphosis was reached. While the extension of pond hydroperiod can ensure complete metamorph development, continued, long term monitoring of occupancy trends and reproductive success is essential to recommend sound management practices. Results of this baseline study reveal that Eagle Marsh Nature Preserve supports a viable and diverse amphibian community, and its restored wetlands can function in promoting occupancy and colonization of rare and declining species. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of White Nose Syndrome (WNS) {{in the eastern}} United States threatens many bat species. WNS has caused the deaths of millions of bats and has endangered bat species including those previously considered to be common. Two affected species are the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and the northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis). The Indiana bat is an endangered species that for decades {{has been the subject}} of conservation efforts. In contrast the northern long-eared bat previously was considered to have robust populations, but mortalities associated with WNS have resulted in a petition to list this species under the Endangered Species Act. In an effort to mitigate the devastating effects of WNS on bat populations, a multifaceted approach to species conservation is warranted. One aspect of such an effort must be the preservation and promotion of suitable habitat for both species. Because Indiana and northern long-eared bats are found in forested habitats during the summer, forest management offers potential for encouraging suitable habitat. Bats have distinct habitat needs at night for foraging/commuting and during the day for roosting. Thus, identifying the habitat required for each life history need independently is crucial. To assess nocturnal habitat for both species, I used acoustic monitoring at 88 sites across Indiana State Forests. I identified species presence at a site based on the classification of echolocation calls. I used single-species and multi-species occupancy models to determine the environmental variables that best predicted nocturnal occupancy. I found that nocturnal occupancy of both species was dependent upon forest composition. In <b>general,</b> <b>occupancy</b> was maximized in recently harvested or mature second-growth stands with a surrounding landscape composed of a higher proportion of open habitat. In addition, the spatial configuration of water and anthropogenic habitat, particularly roads, affected species occupancy. To identify important diurnal habitat used by bats for roosting I used the locations of known roosting sites for both species in a presence-only modeling framework. This allowed me to identify the features of the broader landscape that most influenced diurnal habitat for both species. The proportion of forest and forest edge were important predictors of roosting habitat though both species exhibited somewhat opposing preferences. Finally, I used forest successional modeling to predict future forest conditions under 9 timber harvest scenarios in Indiana State Forests. I applied both nocturnal and diurnal predictive models for Indiana and northern long-eared bats to simulated forest conditions. In addition, I combined roosting and foraging models for both species in order to assess overall habitat suitability under harvest conditions. I found that suitable habitat for both species was substantially impacted by harvest regime. In general, even-aged regenerative timber harvests created more suitable nocturnal habitat than did selective harvests for both species. Single-tree selection harvests, on the other hand, favored suitable diurnal habitat over the larger openings created by regeneration harvests. The degree of impact was somewhat species specific as Indiana bats were more affected by variation in the intensity and form of timber harvests relative to northern long-eared bats. Taken together my research provides important knowledge and guidance for the conservation of threatened bat species. I identified predictors of quality nocturnal and diurnal habitat for Indiana and northern long-eared bats. Because my environmental predictors were based upon data collected remotely, predictive models of nocturnal and diurnal habitat use can be projected across comparable, large areas to identify important habitat conservation sites. In addition, my simulation models highlight the impacts of varying timber harvest pressure and prescriptions on habitat for bats. I recommend silvicultural approaches that couple regenerative and selection harvests so that they may balance the needs of forest management, timber harvest and conservation of bat habitat. ...|$|E

Within 1 MFT, Gilbert derived [PRB 12, 2111 (1975) ] effective single-particle equations analogous to the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations in DFT. The self-consistent solution of these 1 MFT-KS equations reproduces not only the density of the original electron system but also its 1 -matrix. While in DFT it is usually possible to reproduce the density using KS orbitals with integer (0 or 1) occupancy, in 1 MFT reproducing the 1 -matrix requires in <b>general</b> fractional <b>occupancies.</b> The variational principle implies that the KS eigenvalues of all fractionally occupied orbitals must collapse at self-consistency to a single level, equal to the chemical potential.

Fortunately, the level shifting method, commonly introduced in Hartree-Fock calculations, is always able to force convergence. We introduce an alternative derivation of the 1 MFT-KS equations that allows control of the eigenvalue collapse by constraining the occupancies.

Here, chromatin immunoprecipita-tion-microarray experiments normalized to <b>general</b> nucleosome <b>occupancy</b> reveal that nucleosomes within open reading frames (ORFs) and downstream noncoding chromatin were highly dimethylated at H 3 K 36 and that Set 2 p activity begins at a stereotypic distance from the initiation of transcription genome-wide. H 3 K 36 me 2 is scarce in regions upstream of divergently transcribed genes, telomeres, silenced mating loci, and regions transcribed by RNA polymerase III, providing evidence that the enzymatic activity of Set 2 p is restricted to its association with RNAP II. The presence of H 3 K 36 me 2 within ORFs correlated with the “on ” or “off ” state of transcription, but the degree of H 3 K 36 dimethylation within ORFs did not correlate with transcription frequency. This provides evidence that H 3 K 36 me 2 is established during the initial instances of gene tran-scription, with subsequent transcription having at most a maintenance role. Accordingly, newly activated genes acquire H 3 K 36 me 2 in a manner that does not correlate with gene transcript levels. Finally, nucleosomes dimethylated at H 3 K 36 appear to be refractory to loss from highly transcribed chromatin. Thus, H 3 K 36 me 2, which is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, provides a stable molecular mechanism for estab-lishing chromatin context throughout the genome by distinguishing potential regulatory regions from tran...|$|R

ALEX was used to predict the probability of patch occupancy for two species of small native Australian mammals (Antechinus agilis and Rattus fuscipes) among 13 patches of suitable habitat in a matrix of plantation pines (Pinus radiata). The study was retrospective, running each simulation from 1900 until 1997, and the model parameterised without knowledge of the 1997 observed field data of patch occupancy. Predictions were made over eight scenarios for each species, allowing for variation in the amount of dispersal between patches, level of environmental stochasticity, and size of habitat patches. Predicted occupancies were compared to the 1997 field data of patch occupancy using logistic regression, testing H random, that there was no relationship between observed and predicted occupancy, and H perfect, that there was a perfect, 1 : 1 relationship between observed and predicted occupancies. Rejection of H random and failure to reject H perfect was taken as a good match between observed and predicted occupancies. Such a match was found for one scenario with R. fuscipes, and no scenarios with A. agilis. In <b>general,</b> patch <b>occupancy</b> was underestimated, with field surveys finding that 9 of the 13 patches were occupied by R. fuscipes and 10 by A. agilis. Nonetheless, PVA predictions were in the right direction, whereby patches predicted to have a high probability of occupancy were generally occupied, and vice versa. A post hoc search over additional scenarios found few scenarios with a better match than the original eight.

I employ genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the relationships between the TSS phenotypes of Pol II activity/General Transcription Factor (GTF) mutants and conditional and general growth phenotypes. I show that while some conditional growth phenotypes correlate closely with TSS defects, TSS defects are not likely the main determinant for general growth defects. I further explore growth phenotypes and TSS defects between Pol II genetic interactors and GTF mutants combined with Pol II activity mutants and present different models for the relationships discovered so far. I discover a novel function of Sub 1, which is suggested to play positive roles in transcription as an initiation factor, altering TSS utilization on its own and modifying TSS defects conferred by Pol II activity mutants. I take a genome wide approach to map TSSs, <b>general</b> transcription factor <b>occupancies,</b> and nucleosome positions to investigate the mechanism of Pol II activity control over initiation, and determine how promoter architecture influences TSS selection/utilization and nucleosome positioning. I show that promoter architecture is a critical parameter in determination of various initiation properties including transcription output (gene expression) levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{total of}} 12. 7 million Mexicans reside as {{migrants}} in the United States, of whom only 45 % {{have health insurance}} in this country while access to health insurance by migrants in Mexico is fraught with difficulties. Health insurance {{has been shown to}} impact the use of health care in both countries. This paper quantifies hospitalizations by migrants who return from the US seeking medical care in public and private hospitals in the US-Mexico border area and in communities of origin. The proportion of bed utilization and the proportion of hospitalizations in Mexico out of the total expected by migrants in the US were estimated. Methods The universe included 48 Ministry of Health and 47 private hospitals serving municipalities of high or very high migration in Mexico, where 17 % of remittance-receiving households are located, as well as 15 public and 159 private hospitals in 10 Mexican cities along the border with the US. Hospitals were sampled through various methods to include 27 % of beds. Patients and staff were interviewed and data triangulated to quantify migrants that returned to Mexico seeking medical care. Official hospital discharge statistics and secondary data from migration databases and published statistics were analyzed to identify bed <b>occupancy,</b> <b>general</b> migrant hospitalization rates {{and the size of the}} migrant population that maintains close relationships with households in communities of origin. Results Up to 1609 migrants were admitted to public hospitals (76. 6 %) and 492 to private hospitals (23. 4 %) serving municipalities of high and very high migration intensity in 2008. Up to 0. 90 % of public hospital capacity was used. In the border area up to 908 and 2416 migrants were admitted to public (27. 3 %) and private (72. 7 %) hospitals, respectively. Up to 1. 18 % of public hospital capacity was used. Between 2. 4 % and 20. 4 % of the expected hospitalization needs of migrants with dependent households are satisfied through these services. The most common diagnostic categories mentioned across hospitals were traumatisms, complications of diabetes and elective surgery, in that order. Private hospitals mention elective surgeries as the main diagnostic category followed by complications of diabetes. Conclusions Hospitals in communities of origin in Mexico are devoting few resources to respond to hospitalization needs of migrants in the US. Currently no hospital programs exist to stimulate migrant demand or to cater to their specific needs. Registering migratory history in clinical and administrative records can be readily implemented. Developing bi-national referral networks and insuring migrants in the US within current Mexican federal programs could greatly increase migrant access to hospitals. </p...|$|R
