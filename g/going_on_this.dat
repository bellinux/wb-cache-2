Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of February 2, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., the steel support cables that {{stretched}} from end-to-end of stadium that held together the roof were severed, as construction crews set off a simultaneous set of 42 explosive charges that detached the cables from the concrete structure. The general public was not informed about {{this phase of the}} demolition process, prompting about a half-dozen phone calls to police from people who wondered what was <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> was viewed as the final step before the destruction of the concrete bowl of the Metrodome would begin. On February 10, 2014, shortly after 9:15a.m., after more than two months of preliminary work that dated back {{all the way to the}} groundbreaking of the new Vikings stadium, demolition of the stadium walls finally began.|$|E

25|$|As {{cards are}} read in round, {{it is common}} for an {{opponent}} to collect and examine even while a speech is still <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.|$|E

500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, Let's Get It On {{has been viewed}} by writers as a {{milestone}} in soul music. In The Best Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time, Jimmy Guterman writes that the album was [...] "a bit more conventional musically (soul crossing into mild funk) and much more focused lyrically than its predecessor, What's Going On". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot commended Gaye for using [...] "the multi-tracked vocals perfected on What's <b>Going</b> <b>On,</b> <b>this</b> time to convey his most intimate desires", commenting that [...] "while the album is replete with erotic imagery, both implied and explicit, it is also as much preoccupied with distance and unfulfilled need". Jason Ankeny of Allmusic called it [...] "a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy", writing that [...] "Gaye's passions reach their boiling point [...] With each performance laced with innuendo, each lyric a come-on, and each rhythm throbbing with lust, perhaps no other record has ever achieved the kind of sheer erotic force of Let's Get It On". Ankeny also dubbed it [...] "one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded." [...] Allmusic's Lindsay Planer cites it as a [...] "hedonistic R masterpiece." [...] BBC Music's Daryl Easlea found Gaye [...] "in supreme command of his material", and viewed it as [...] "much more than an album about simple lust", but an [...] "iconic, rapturous work".|$|E

2500|$|The studio {{increased}} the budget from $6.7 to $8.7 million and gave Linklater {{six months to}} finish the film. Pallotta took charge and instituted a more traditional Disney-esque production ethic that included a style manual, strict deadlines, and breaking the film up into smaller segments. The animation process lasted 15 months. Linklater said, {{in regard to the}} post-production problems, [...] "There's a lot of misinformation out there... Changes took place during the early stages of us really getting <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> had everything to do with management and not art. It was a budgetary concern, essentially." ...|$|E

[...] "I couldn't believe he was really <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> because it was really strange," [...] Perhaps not so [...] "hare-brained" [...] to others, since according to a US State Dept. memo sent from the US Embassy in Singapore, at 0834 Zulu time, 29 July 1983: [...] "Luckily, Grimley did not know or chose not to reveal the exact locations of the treasure on the island, else the Vice Consul in Singapore may have set her jib by now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fa Zheng and Zhuge Liang did {{not share}} the same moral beliefs {{but they had a}} good working {{relationship}} because of their common goal, which was to serve Liu Bei well. Zhuge Liang was very impressed with Fa Zheng's brilliance. In 221, before the Battle of Xiaoting, many of Liu Bei's subjects advised their lord against going to war with his former ally, Sun Quan, who seized Jing Province from Liu in 219 and executed Liu's general Guan Yu. Liu Bei ignored them and proceeded with his campaign against Sun Quan. In the following year, he lost to Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting and had to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died in 223. Zhuge Liang sighed, [...] "If Fa Xiaozhi was still alive, he could have prevented our lord from <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> eastern campaign; even if our lord did go on this campaign, he wouldn't have ended up in this disastrous situation (if Fa Xiaozhi was with him)." ...|$|E

However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
2500|$|Hantke and Spoerer {{write that}} [...] "reparation {{payments}} were indeed a severe economic burden for Germany" [...] and that [...] "the German economy was deprived of {{between one and}} 2.2 billion Reichsmark (RM) annually, which amounted in the late 1920s to nearly 2.5 per cent of Germany's GDP". Gerald Feldman writes, [...] "there can be {{no question that the}} entire London schedule could be viewed as a way of reducing the reparations bill without the Allied publics being fully informed of what was <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> was recognized by at least some German politicians, one of whom optimistically argued that 'the entente will only demand the 50 billion marks, not the rest. They have only called for the rest for domestic political reasons.'" [...] Feldman also says the prospect that the 'C' bonds would be evoked hung over the German Government like a [...] "Damocles Sword". In addition to Feldman and Ferguson's opposition, Peter Kruger, Barry Eichengreen, and Steven Webb agree that [...] "the initial German effort to pay reparations" [...] was substantial and [...] "produced an immense strain" [...] on the German economy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, former Secretary Kissinger was feted by the [...] "dirty war" [...] generals as a much-touted {{guest of}} honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to The Nation editor Victor Navasky, protesting {{publication}} of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed that: [...] "At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates." [...] Ironically, Kissinger's posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false {{by none other than}} once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told William E. Knight, an oral historian working for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project: [...] "It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary, or it began to come to a head, in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower. Bob Hill, who was Ambassador then in Buenos Aires, a very conservative Republican politician -- by no means liberal or anything of the kind, began to report quite effectively about what was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>this</b> slaughter of innocent civilians, supposedly innocent civilians -- this vicious war that they were conducting, underground war.|$|E

2500|$|... "Disconnected" [...] was {{included}} as a bonus track on Big Choice, along with a cover of the Descendents song [...] "Bikeage". After the album's eleventh track, [...] "Late", there is a twelfth untitled track consisting of a conversation between the band members and representatives from the record label {{about whether or not}} to include [...] "Disconnected" [...] on the album, with the band members stating that {{they do not want to}} be labeled as [...] "sellouts" [...] or lose credibility with their fans, and one member stating that [...] "there's no way in hell this song's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> record." [...] "Disconnected" [...] then appears as the thirteenth track. This third version of the song included second guitarist Chad Yaro, who had joined the band prior to the recording of Over It. A music video was filmed and the song reached #39 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1995. It was also used in the soundtracks for the films Tank Girl and National Lampoon's Senior Trip that same year. The song's success ultimately helped Big Choice to sell over 100,000 copies. Rich Egan, who became the band's manager shortly after the release of Big Choice, has recalled that Disconnected' was on the radio and the band was getting bigger by the day. It was just GO GO GO from day one." ...|$|E
