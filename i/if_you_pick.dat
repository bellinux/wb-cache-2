500|$|Their feud {{was blamed}} for {{contributing}} to the low morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] of April 1945, {{when a group of}} senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets. Alerted to the issue by No.1 TAF's commander, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations. According to historian Kristen Alexander, his methods were construed as an attempt to [...] "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up"; one of the [...] "mutineers", Squadron Leader John Waddy, quoted Bostock as saying, [...] "I will leave these applications on the table and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> them up, all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it". When the pilots refused to drop the matter, Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale on the island to be at a [...] "dangerously low level" [...] and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore Scherger. Kenney concurred with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby. A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock: [...] "I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann {{was raised}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He turned down offers from the University of Wisconsin and nearby Marquette University, as well as coach Bear Bryant at the University of Kentucky, to attend the University of Michigan and play {{football}} for Fritz Crisler. Ortmann recalled: “My high school coach would say, ‘Chuck, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> Michigan, you’re picking the best. [...] After you graduate, people will know you and remember you.’ [...] I made the right decision.” He was a versatile player, starting at [...] safety on defense and halfback on offense, as well as punting, placekicking, and returning punts and kickoffs. He was a starter as a sophomore for the undefeated 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the National Championship. As a senior in 1950, {{he was responsible for}} 90% of Michigan's total offense.|$|E
2500|$|In this spacetime, it is {{possible}} to come up with coordinate systems such that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> a hypersurface of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a space-like separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') and draw an [...] "embedding diagram" [...] depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an [...] "EinsteinRosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.|$|E

Spider-Man's motif has a small arc to match that character's few appearances, being introduced very gently as the [...] "somewhat confused, slightly tender" [...] Peter Parker first appears, followed by [...] "the seed of his heroism" [...] when he is recruited for the Avengers, and finally a [...] "full-blown version" [...] plays when he fights alongside the other heroes. For Black Panther, Jackman used a combination of African woodwind instruments whenever the character talks about his ancestors, while muted trombones [...] "brought his character into {{the grandeur of the}} symphony orchestra, but there’s a slightly vengeful, serrated sound to muted trombones <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> the right kind of mood". Zemo's personal theme was performed on [...] "a lot of these rather unusual tuned bells" [...] that gave him an [...] "otherly sound", as well as a cimbalon to represent his Eastern European roots.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a playable {{character}} in , voiced by Molly Hagan. She can be unlocked by collecting 5 shards of the M'Kraan Crystal. Her default costume is her Phoenix costume. She uses telepathy, telekinesis, {{and the power of}} the Phoenix. Jean's alternate costume is her [...] costume and she fits in the X-Men, Masters of Energy, Repentant Killers, Natural Leaders, and Femme Fatales team bonuses. Since she is a playable character in this game, her fate in the first game is non-canon. In the game she has a special conversation with Cable, however this conversation is only available <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> Anti-Registration in the game, it deals on their family relationship and the status on the Civil War. Jean also has the unique ability to possibly resurrect herself from the dead in both versions of the game. In game, whenever Jean picks up an object the object hovers, giving the effect that Jean is holding the object with her tk. During her block, whenever she is hit by a projectile a telekinetic shield is partially visible. There is quite a difference in the PS2/PSP/Wii version of her and her Xbox 360/PS3 version. In the former, Jean's telekinesis and telepathy is in the form of her pink energy signature, along with some fiery powers, and most of the animations are completely from X-Men Legends II. She also harnesses the signature Phoenix raptor during fusions. In the latter version, all of Jean's powers are fiery energy, including her telekinesis and telepathy. No Phoenix Raptor is in this version of her. Jean is not playable in the DS Version. Jean also appears on the back of the MUA2 cover for all versions. For some reason on the back of the cover she possess the fiery mane type of hair that she had under the artistic work of Phil Jimenez and Greg Land, but in the actual game she has straight hair.|$|E

6000|$|... 8. I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John; {{he gave me}} {{a letter}} to read, which was from the {{publisher}} of the newspaper called the Postboy;(4) in it there was a long copy of a letter from Dublin, giving an account of what the Whigs said upon Mr. Harley's being stabbed, and how much they abuse him and Mr. Secretary St. John; and at the end there were half a dozen lines, telling the story of the Archbishop of Dublin, and abusing him horribly; this was to be printed on Tuesday. I told the Secretary I would not suffer that about the Archbishop to be printed, and so I crossed it out; and afterwards, to prevent all danger, I made him give me the letter, and, upon further thought, would let none of it be published: and I sent for the printer, and told him so, and ordered him, in the Secretary's name, to print nothing reflecting on anybody in Ireland till he had showed it me. Thus I have prevented a terrible scandal to the Archbishop, by a piece of perfect good fortune. I will let him know it by next post; and pray, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> it out, let me know, and whether he is thankful for it; but say nothing.|$|E

60|$|It is only bodily {{phenomena}} {{that can be}} directly observed in animals, or even, strictly speaking, in other human beings. We can observe such things as their movements, their physiological processes, and the sounds they emit. Such things as desires and beliefs, which seem obvious to introspection, are not visible directly to external observation. Accordingly, if we begin our study of psychology by external observation, we must not begin by assuming such things as desires and beliefs, but only such things as external observation can reveal, which will be characteristics of the movements and physiological processes of animals. Some animals, for example, always run away from light and hide themselves in dark places. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up a mossy stone which is lightly embedded in the earth, {{you will see a}} number of small animals scuttling away from the unwonted daylight and seeking again the darkness of which you have deprived them. Such animals are sensitive to light, in the sense that their movements are affected by it; but it would be rash to infer that they have sensations in any way analogous to our sensations of sight. Such inferences, which go beyond the observable facts, are to be avoided with the utmost care.|$|E
6000|$|He had {{discovered}} the divine boomerang; his sin had found him out. The experiment of Individualism--the keeping of the worker half in and half out of work--was far too ingenious not to contain a flaw. It was too delicate a balance to work entirely with {{the strength of the}} starved and the vigilance of the benighted. It was too desperate a course to rely wholly on desperation. And as time went on the terrible truth slowly declared itself; the degraded class was really degenerating. It was right and proper enough to use a man as a tool; but the tool, ceaselessly used, was being used up. It was quite reasonable and respectable, of course, to fling a man away like a tool; but when it was flung away in the rain the tool rusted. But the comparison to a tool was insufficient for an awful reason that had already begun to dawn upon the master's mind. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up a hammer, you do not find a whole family of nails clinging to it. If you fling away a chisel by the roadside, it does not litter and leave a lot of little chisels. But the meanest of the tools, Man, had still this strange privilege which God had given him, doubtless by mistake. Despite all improvements in machinery, {{the most important part of}} the machinery (the fittings technically described in the trade as [...] "hands") were apparently growing worse.

60|$|Everybody {{knows the}} aphides well by sight, {{in one of}} their forms at least, the {{familiar}} rose aphis; but probably few people ever look at them closely and critically enough to observe how very beautiful and wonderful is the organisation of their tiny limbs in all its exquisite detail. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> off one good-sized wingless insect, however, from a blighted rose-leaf, and put him on a glass slide under a low power of the microscope, you will most likely be quite surprised to find what a lovely little creature it is that you have been poisoning wholesale all your life long with diluted tobacco-juice. His body is so transparent that you can see through it by transmitted light: a dainty glass globe, you would say, of emerald green, set upon six tapering, jointed, hairy legs, and provided in front with two large black eyes of many facets, and a pair of long and very flexible antennæ, easily moved in any direction, but usually bent backward when the creature is at rest so as to reach nearly to his tail as he stands at ease upon his native rose-leaf. There are, however, two other features about him which specially attract attention, as being very characteristic of the aphides and their allies among all other insects. In the first place, his mouth is provided with a very long snout or proboscis, classically described as a rostrum, with which he pierces the outer skin of the rose-shoot where he lives, and sucks up incessantly its sweet juices. This organ is common to the aphis with all the other bugs and plant-lice. In the second place, he has half-way down his back (or a little more) a pair of very peculiar hollow organs, the honey tubes, from which exudes that singular secretion, the honey-dew. These tubes are not found in quite all species of aphides, but they are very common among the class, and they form by far the most conspicuous and interesting organs in all those aphides which do possess them.|$|E
