Contrary to recent micro evidence based on randomised evaluations pointing to no or weak effect on poverty, there is robust confirmation of the poverty reducing role of microfinance. Significantly, microfinance loans are negatively associated with not only the poverty headcount ratio, {{but also with the}} poverty gap and squared poverty gap, implying that even the poorest benefit from them. The case for channelling funds from development finance institutions and governments of developing countries into MFIs is thus reinforced.

Informal credit systems are vibrant forms of economic exchange that continue to prevail in Cambodia today despite the increasing popularity of Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs). The informal systems are the dominant forms of credit in rural communities; they are based on a culture of reciprocity embedded in kinship practices, loyalty and sharing among family, close friends, neighbors and also based on the economic principle of risk sharing and personalized relations in business transactions. Buddhist beliefs in karma lend moral authority to the notion that loans must be repaid.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the impact of regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs) on the operations of these institutions in Senegal. The findings suggest that the regulation of MFIs in Senegal brought many benefits, such as improved customers confidence in MFIs and hence increased the mobilization of savings from small savers to MFIs. This reduced the dependence of MFIs on donor agencies for loanable funds as well as it increased the outreach, i. e. the number of families served by MFIs in Senegal. With the increasing credit expansion, however, MFIs also began to report higher loan default rates which required them to charge higher interest rates to compensate for their loan losses. According to the regulations however, the interest rate ceiling on loans does not allow MFIs to adjust their rates to the levels that will give them enough earnings to cover their losses. Furthermore, as the average loan size of MFIs increased, a collateral requirement became essential to borrow <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> in Senegal.

A field survey was conducted {{and a total of}} 200 SMEs were randomly selected from the city and interviewed with the structured questionnaire. To answer the research questions posted by the researchers both descriptive and econometrics method of analyses were used. The main research questions answered by the researchers are as follows: What are the characteristics of SME owners and SMEs? The average age of firm owners is 39  years of old, 90  % of the firms are owned by male and 10  % of them by female entrepreneurs, 87  % of the firm’s owners are married and the average years of schooling is 12. On the other hand, average age of firms is 10  years and the average initial outlay of the firms are BDT six lacs (0.6 million) where 64  % of total firms are doing their business in the rental house. What are the major sources of finance? The major sources of finance for SMEs are friends and family (33  %), 32  % from their own savings, 21.5  % from banks, 5  % from loan organizations, 4  % <b>from</b> <b>MFIs,</b> 2  % from money lenders and 2.5  % from selling assets. This shows the majority of the SMEs is financed from informal sources; of course, the share of formal financial institutions is also high.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{out of the}} total 111 firms that applied for the loan, most of them received credit from the formal financial institution. Table 9 (Appendix 4) shows that the higher number of firms applied for the loan {{for the purpose of}} their business expansion, of course, few firms were applied for the purpose of starting new business. Therefore, the motive of loan for business expansion means that the loan was mainly used for income generation activities. Most firms financed their business from own savings, friends or family and banks. A few firms also financed their business <b>from</b> <b>MFIs,</b> Credit Organizations, and Money Lenders (Table 10, Appendix 5). This implies that the major source of finance for SMEs are friends and family as many of the small firms do not have collateral that can be provided for banks and also they do not meet the requirements that are set by banks. In short, the major sources of finance for SMEs in Chittagong were from formal FIs, mainly banks. The number of firms that were financed from their own saving was also large. The share of informal institutions in this case family or friends, money lenders and credit organization or cooperative society that financed for SMEs was also huge. This indicates that informal institutions are also greatly contributing to the development of SMEs and creating employment opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the demand for credit and credit {{rationing}} conducted by formal, informal and emerging microfinance lenders in the four poor counties of China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper extends the existing studies on credit rationing in rural China by comparing the determinants of credit rationing by three different lenders, the formal lenders rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), the informal lenders and the new microfinance institutions (MFIs). Findings - MFIs are capable of reaching out to the even poorer households if they develop the loan products based on the income and expenditure flows of these households. Research limitations/ implications - The determinants of credit rationing by three types of institutions are estimated separately. Practical implications - RCCs in China shall change their policy of discrimination against female-headed households. RCCs shall also simplify the loan application procedures and assess the clients based on their repayment capacities rather than the age or assets alone. RCCs could learn <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> to use incomes from migrant workers as a criterion to assess the loan applicants. Social implications - gender equity for loan access.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to examine whether {{microfinance}} reduces poverty in Bangladesh drawing upon the nationally representative household panel data covering 4 rounds from 1997 to 2005. A special attention was drawn to the issue of endogeneity by applying treatment effects model and propensity score matching (PSM) for the participants and non-participants of microfinance programmes. It has been found by treatment effects model applied to panel data that the simple household access to general loans from microfinance institutions (MFIs) did not increase per capita household income significantly, but household access to loans for productive purposes <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> significantly increased per capita household income. This suggests that the purpose and monitoring of how clients use the loans is important for increasing household income, and thus decreasing household poverty. However, the application of treatment effects model and PSM to each cross-sectional component of the panel data shows that the poverty reducing effect of MFI on poverty was significantly reduced over the years. This suggests the importance of more attention to the primary purpose of microcredit, that is, poverty reduction, and also to monitoring loan usages in the situations where the profits of MFIs became increasingly squeezed and their activities became more commercialised under severe competitions among MFIs in recent years. microfinance, MFI (microfinance institution), Microcredit, Poverty, Bangladesh...|$|E

Purposive sample was drawn from business premises where persons operating on business financed by microloans <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> were found. Qualitative analysis captured additional contextual determinants of loan repayment problems being corruption among loan officers, failure of loan disclosure within families, unfair business tax estimation, proxy business supervision, diverting loan money to different purpose, having been operating business into an informal premises which leads to confiscation of business products and demolishing structures at business sites by polices of municipal council and unforeseen situation like falling into sickness by loan client or his/her family member, death of relative, theft of business product, road traffic accidents, catastrophes such as fire and flood were implicated factors.

The project title is "Enhancing accessibility and utilization of micro credit among women and youths in the two villages of Valeska and Malula, Arumeru district, Arusha region". The survey was conducted in collaboration with BEST. The sample size was 89 respondents from Malula and Valesca villages, 4 staff <b>from</b> <b>MFIs,</b> 2 staff from Arumeru DCDD and 3 staff from BEST. The methodology used include structured interviews, direct observation, focus group discussions, key informants interviews, questionnaires, documentation and field visits. The main findings revealed the following as the main causes of inadequate/lack of micro credit in the two villages: -Most micro credit institution are not attracted to provide services in the rural areas due to higher risks related to rural activities; Remoteness of the villages that causes longer transport distances, travel costs due to poor infrastructures; High operational costs which force the interest rate to be very high, ranged from 20 % to 40 % for MFIs and 10 % per year for the government funds. Therefore, micro credit institutions and the government credit funds should reach in the villages to cater for the poor people and not to concentrate in urban and semi urban. By doing so the women and youths will be able to run profitable business and improve their well-being.

40|$|Small {{enterprises}} are a {{major source}} of livelihood for most people in the developing world. Their ability to grow is however, undermined by credit constraints. This has often been attributed to the lack of registered property ownership which is argued to make property insecure and unacceptable to lenders. Though several studies have been conducted on the relationship between property registration and credit access, the focus is usually on the demand side mainly involving households and the agricultural sector. Furthermore, no studies have compared the developed and developing countries. Finally, the exact nature of, the credit constraint amongst businesses in countries such as Ghana for instance is not known. This research therefore, set out to conduct a demand-side study into the nature of the credit constraint amongst small businesses in Ghana and a supply-side investigation of the influence of registration on small businesses access to credit. The multi methodology was deemed most suitable approach for the investigation of the objectives of the study. The quantitative approach was first used to investigate the objectives. Part of the initial findings was validated through the quantitative approach whilst the other part was validated through the qualitative approach. The results show amongst other things that the existing credit constraint is almost entirely a supply side problem. The supply side study showed that in Ghana, unregistered property is not eligible for use as collateral but this is applicable only to the universal banks (UBs) and not the microfinance institutions (MFIs). That said, the possession of registered property title was not found to influence the loan terms that businesses are offered neither was there evidence that it guarantees access to credit. Even though in England the eligibility of property was not dependent on whether it is registered or not, lenders also did agree that the possession of registered property does not guarantee credit access neither does it influence the credit terms businesses are offered. It was concluded that since majority of small businesses in Ghana seek credit <b>from</b> <b>MFIs,</b> the lack of registered property titles does not constitute a major barrier to credit access. The I main barriers to credit access identified are the poor repayment ability and high risk of default amongst others. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} implications of access to microfinance for gender equity and household welfare in Ghana. The study draws on the quantitative and qualitative evidence from a unique dataset generated from a survey of 499 households, with and without access to microfinance, during my field research work in Ghana from May to July 2013. The motivation for the dissertation derives from evidence suggesting that access to finance is an important tool for fighting poverty and reducing inequality. However, for most developing countries access to finance for the poor is mainly through the informal or the semi-formal sector, including microfinance institutions (MFIs). Microfinance is taking the center stage in developing countries as {{a major source of}} finance for the poor. The question is whether there is a risk that the conditions of the poor could be worsened through increased debt burden from access to credit <b>from</b> <b>MFIs.</b> This question is legitimate for two main reasons. First, the interest rates charged by MFIs on credit tend to be relatively higher than those charged by banks. Second, higher interest rates imply higher debt obligations for low income households with low returns on investment, which weakens their balance sheet. This is a cause of concern, especially given the lack of institutional mechanisms for households in developing countries to deal with debt distress. This situation may make it harder for households to obtain additional external financing and to sustain expenditures, thereby leading to worsening household welfare. The evidence from this study shows that access to microfinance reduces gender asset gaps and generally improves household welfare. Further, the results suggest that debt burden beyond certain thresholds creates significant financial distress for households and reduces food expenditures while increasing the household’s credit constraints. The study shows that microfinance market, borrower-specific and household-specific characteristics are important factors explaining household indebtedness. Using an approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis, and by applying different econometric approaches to household welfare analysis, this dissertation contributes to the growing body of empirical literature on the impact of access to microfinance on household-level welfare. It also contributes to a relatively new area of research on borrower debt distress arising from access to microfinance...|$|E
40|$|Donor {{grants and}} soft loans have been {{utilized}} by many microfinance institutions (MFIs) {{to support their}} operations. However, such grants and loans, already of limited size and availability, are becoming harder to access as the pool of global MFIs grows. Another option for MFIs is tapping international capital markets, international loan and security markets, {{but there are many}} barriers to this practice. This paper studies how MFIs and the poor who are seeking capital to foster their entrepreneurial spirits can overcome these barriers to access international capital markets and meet the growing micro finance demand. First, this paper establishes the degree of linkage between MFIs and international financial markets by reviewing the present funding condition of MFIs. It concludes that purely commercially based funding from capital markets is minimal except for some of the best managed MFIs. A huge gap exists between most other MFIs and international capital markets. Second, this palper studies the microfinance investment potential by analyzing the returns of one microfinance investment fund. It concludes that the profile of microfinance investment matches the needs of investors in capital markets. (cont.) Investors in developed countries are always looking for investment products that mitigate their portfolio volatility. This paper verifies that microfinance has an attractive profile matching these needs, and offering stable return, as well as low correlation with stocks, bonds and macroeconomic factors. Capital market investors and microfinance have the potential to build win-win relationships. One of the remaining challenges of MFIs is generating required return commensurate with risks. Third, this paper proposes securitization in a microfinance global pool as a means to overcome the barriers to connecting MFIs and the poor to capital markets. In this securitization scheme, the global pool buys microcredits <b>from</b> <b>MFIs,</b> thereby 1) increasing return, 2) enabling many MFIs to obtain funds from capital markets by sharing fixed costs of funding, 3) reducing exchange rate and geographic concentration risks, and 4) creating secondary markets and liquidity. Some challenges to securitization still need to be overcome. Nevertheless, this paper demonstrates that; securitization in the microfinance global pool will be an effective means {{to bridge the gap between}} capital markets and MFIs and the poor. by Daisuke Ueno.

40|$|Thesis (MDF (Development Finance)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effects of the global financial, economic, and food price crises on microfinance institutions (MFIs), and on the microfinance industry in general as well as to illuminate microfinance‘s way forward in the medium-term (2 - 3 year) future. The research report took the form of an international survey representing the responses of 59 MFIs in 39 countries. It is unique in its focus on microfinance practitioners <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> of all sizes and profit orientations, and that it only sought responses from the six developing regions of the world—Latin American and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. This report identifies 23 impacts of the crises and groups them into four classifications—client impacts, liquidity and profitability impacts, MFI growth and development impacts, and political and reputational impacts. This study demonstrates that the crises have affected MFIs around the world profoundly, and that MFIs have faced a resilient hierarchy of impact groups. Across MFI regions, sizes, ages, product offerings, registration status classifications, and affiliations, the four impact groups were shown to maintain the same order of severity, with client impacts being the category of biggest concern of MFI respondents. Also severe were liquidity and profitability impacts. The least severe categories of impacts were found to be MFI growth and development impacts and political and reputational impacts, respectively. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of microfinance practitioner responses, this report establishes an overall ranking of the 23 impacts the global crises are having on the industry. The analysis has further revealed that Sub-Saharan Africa reported the highest impacts of the crises out of all the regions surveyed. The size of an MFI affects its resilience against the crises, with small MFIs being more severely affected than large MFIs. Age was found to have an inverse relationship with MFI impact ratings, and there were very few significant differences between for- and non-profit MFIs. This research report has demonstrated that the benefits afforded to MFIs by accepting deposits may have been over-promoted by industry observers during the early stages of the crises, as no apparent benefits have emerged from responses to this survey. The report concludes with a summary of respondent indications about the way forward for the microfinance industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{study with}} its {{two-fold}} objectives undertakes a descriptive analysis of how Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) have evolved into its multi-tiered state in Ghana {{and how their}} development has impacted other stakeholders in Ghana’s economy especially Micro and Small-Scale Enterprises (MSEs). Additionally, this study undertakes an empirical and exploratory case study to investigate how MFIs in Ghana are influencing access to finance by MSEs. Given that MFIs and MSEs impact large swaths of very poor households, contribute fairly to the GDP of their countries, possess the potential to lift poor household above the poverty line, absorb the ramifications of economic recessions and fiscal adjustments, and provide employment and welfare; they constitute a potent investment and developmental tool for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and national development programmes in developing countries. The study shows how Ghana’s MFI sector has evolved through years of regulatory reform into a multi-tiered microfinance framework to fill the financial chasm and disparity. It is also shown that the main financial and banking institutions are extending their depth of coverage to poor households through partnership with MFIs. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to {{a random sample of}} 25 MFIs and 25 MSEs. The questionnaires qualitatively measured and assessed among others the firm characteristics, access and use of capital, the use of savings accounts, the impact of business loans, loan policy and procedures, marketing strategy, customer evaluations, business motivation, business challenges and loan repayment. Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) serve only about 5 % of Ghanaian households. 70 % of households are reported to have members without a savings account. The main source of household credit and loans is relatives, friends and neighbours. Findings from the study indicate the main source of start-up capital for both MFIs and MSEs are personal savings, followed by the use of business loans. MFIs are the main source of business loans for MSEs. MSEs are confronted with lengthy loan processing and approvals times of up to 3 months and are required to provide collateral for loans. The main types of loan collaterals are physical assets and savings with the MFI. The latter being a contributory factor to the lengthy loan processing and approval time. MFIs offer MSEs very flexible payment terms and are easily accessible to MSEs, which are the key decision factors for MSEs in deciding an institution for loan application. MSEs hold favourable views of MFIs and the kind of financial services MFIs offer them. MSEs used business loans mostly in business growth and expansion. MSEs indicated business loans <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> had overall positive impact on their revenues, profits and their overall business activities. MSEs highlighted access to loans as their main business challenge. Loans offered by MFIs are tailored to meet their specific needs – fixed interest rates, short maturity (3 - 6 months) and flexible payment terms. The main business challenges for MFIs are customer loan defaults and competition. The study has shown that MFIs are increasing their momentum to harness the investment and developmental opportunities that limited or lack of access to financial services and products presents, which this study has shown to be {{the driving force behind the}} growth and expansion of MSEs and with a culminated impact on Ghana’s economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a community, especially a poor community, hinges on interventions from development workers in government and non government organisations. In the recent past, microfinance has been strongly recommended as an intervention that could assist poor people to improve {{their quality of life}} by providing small amounts of money to initiate development enterprises. The microfinance services are provided through microfinance institutions. This study was aimed at establishing the role of microfinance in the socioeconomic {{development of}} women in a community. Mpigi Town Council in Uganda was the study area. Fifty respondents were interviewed and eight of these were employees of microfinance institutions and two worked as technical staff from Mpigi District Local Government. Twelve microfinance institutions were identified as providing services to the community in Mpigi Town Council. A variety of literature on microfinance in the developed world, developing world, Africa, Uganda and Mpigi Town Council was reviewed. It was noted that the year 2005 was identified as the International Year of Micro-credit during which its significance would be highlighted. The aim of the international year of microcredit was to improve on the knowledge, access and utilization of micro-credit by poor people in the developing world. During the literature review, it was evident that the literature on the impact of microfinance on the socio-economic development of women in Mpigi Town Council was lacking. By filling this gap, this research will be a referral document for other researchers and a resource book for microfinance institutions during the implementation of their programmes. The study was carried out using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect the data that was presented in tables, graphs and numbers to show the role played by microfinance in the socio-economic development of women in a community. The findings of the study reveal that microfinance institutions operating in Mpigi Town Council provide services like training and skills development, insured credit facilities and savings mobilisation, banking facilities, supervision and monitoring of the clients, provision of agriculture inputs like seeds and chemicals and physical items like animals (cows, goats, pigs, sheep etc). The services are particularly provided to women groups, salary earners, and individual women and men. The repayment of the credit facilities is usually through weekly and monthly instalments. The size of the loan depends on the MFI but ranges from one hundred thousand to millions of shillings. The security usually required is group collateral in case of groups, salary in case of salary earners and any other as deemed necessary for the individual by the MFI. The study established that women who accessed the loans <b>from</b> <b>MFIs</b> were able to improve their socio-economic status through starting up and or expanding investments and enterprises, paying school fees for their children, purchase of household items like furniture, land and solar installation, building of houses, confidence building, participation in leadership roles etc. The research also found out that women face some challenges in their access and utilization of the MFI services and these include; small amounts of money disbursed, diversion of funds, high interest rates, low returns on investment, short grace periods, unfavourable repayment schedules and risk of property confiscation by the MFI. The respondents recommended that the government should intervene, especially where interest rate is concerned and centralize it or make it uniform and also monitor the operations of the MFIs so that they offer adequate services to the women. As far as the MFIs are concerned, the respondents recommended that they should lower the interest rate, empathize with their clients, monitor and supervise more vigorously, collaborate with fellow MFIs, increase grace period and enlist the support of employers in the area. For the microfinance beneficiaries, the beneficiaries recommended that they should not divert the funds but should use them for the purpose intended. Furthermore, they should not move from one MFI to another. They ought to acquire the loan when they have some investment already, study the MFI before acquiring the services and support each other as a group to ensure that there is progress in the various undertakings. The results of the research have led to the assertion and affirmation that although the benefits may vary from one beneficiary to another and from one community to another, microfinance has in various ways {{played a significant role in}} the socio-economic development of women in Mpigi Town Council.
