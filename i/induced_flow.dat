The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of attention training that <b>induces</b> <b>flow</b> experience for patients with attention-deficit disorder after traumatic brain injury (TBI). MethodsA two-patient case report with a within-subject AB design was conducted. Two patients with attention deficit after TBI were recruited for attention training. Two types of video game tasks for attention training were created, one <b>inducing</b> <b>flow</b> (flow task) and the other not (control task). Patient A performed the flow task for 14 days after receiving general occupational therapy (OT) for 11 days. Patient B performed the flow task for 15 days after performing the control task for 10 days. We examined training effects using neuropsychological tests. The Flow State Scale for Occupational Tasks was administered to identify the patient's flow state. To evaluate the training effect, we used visual analysis, the two-standard deviation band method, and effect-size analyses. ResultsBoth Patient A and Patient B showed improvement on the Continuous Performance Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Moss Attention Rating Scale after the flow task.

In this paper, we propose a method to construct control flow graph by computing separately normal flow and exception flow. We show that normal flow and exception flow can be safely decoupled, hence these two flows can be computed separately.

50|$|Free vortex models (FVM) and Lagrangian {{particle}} vortex methods (LPVM) {{are both}} active {{areas of research}} that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting {{for more of the}} three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to lifting line theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges. LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot-Savart summation is used to determine the <b>induced</b> <b>flow</b> field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.|$|E
5000|$|In forward flight, {{there is}} no upward flow (upflow) of air in the hub area. As forward {{airspeed}} decreases and vertical descent rates increase, an upflow begins {{because there are no}} airfoil surfaces in the mast and blade grip area. As volume of upflow increases, the <b>induced</b> <b>flow</b> (air pulled or [...] "induced" [...] down through the rotor system) of the inner blade sections is overcome and the blades begin to stall near the hub. As the inner blade sections stall, a second set of vortices, similar to the rotor tip vortices, form {{in the center of the}} rotor system. The inner set of vortices decreases the amount of lift being produced and causes an increase in sink rate. In an accelerated condition, the inner and outer vortices begin to feed each other to the point where any increase in rotor blade pitch angle increases the interaction between the vortices and increases the rate of descent. In this state, the helicopter is operating in its own downwash, descending through descending air. The failure of a helicopter pilot to recognize and react to the condition can lead to high descent rates and impact with terrain.|$|E
50|$|The D-DIA {{is based}} on the similar DIA, which is a cubic-anvil apparatus. The D-DIA is a type of multi-anvil {{deformation}} apparatus that uses 6 cubically arranged anvils to provide independent pressurization and deformation of the sample. Four anvils of the cubic arrangement are oriented in the horizontal opposing at 90°, and the remaining two anvils are oriented in the vertical within two guide blocks. The back side of each horizontal anvil comprises two faces of a virtual octahedron. By the symmetry imposed from the advancing guide blocks and anvils, all axes of the virtual octahedron are then strained equally and thus provide hydrostatic pressure to the sample.In order to create a deviatoric stress, oil is pumped using two differential rams behind the top and bottom anvils located within the guide blocks allowing them to advance independent of the other four. By advancing just one anvil pair, a deviatoric stress is created thus altering the previously cubic stress field to one that is tetragonal. The <b>induced</b> <b>flow</b> is approximately axially-symmetric with respect to the cylindrical sample). By advancing an anvil pair pressure would begin to increase on the sample as deformation progresses, but the D-DIA has the capability of bleeding off oil from the main ram (which engages the guide blocks) while advancing the differential pumps, in order to maintain a constant sample pressure during deformation.|$|E
