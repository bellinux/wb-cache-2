Their framework classifies frugal <b>innovation</b> and the related terms by using the three dimensions: sophistication, sustainability, and emerging market orientation.

They classify frugal <b>innovation</b> via the criteria technical novelty and market novelty. In their view, frugal <b>innovation</b> has a higher technical novelty and a higher market novelty than good-enough <b>innovation</b> and cost <b>innovation.</b> Also, in their conceptualisation, cost <b>innovation</b> means the same for less, good-enough <b>innovation</b> means tailored for less, and frugal <b>innovation</b> means new for less. Ostraszewska and Tylec (2015) use a similar conceptualisation, with the criteria the same for less, adapted for less, and new for less to distinguish between cost <b>innovation,</b> jugaad <b>innovation,</b> Gandhian <b>innovation,</b> good-enough <b>innovation,</b> and frugal <b>innovation.</b> In their classification, the GE LOGIQ Book Ultrasound Machine {{is an example of}} frugal <b>innovation</b> (new for less), while the city car Tata Nano is an example of Gandhian <b>innovation</b> (adapted for less); elsewhere, the Tata Nano is used as a typical example of frugal <b>innovation</b> (Rao 2013; Tiwari and Herstatt 2014; Wooldridge 2010).|$|R

40|$|Creating a {{portfolio}} of effective <b>innovation</b> capabilities has become a critical competence to compete, and is vital in <b>innovation</b> management. The need for this research originated from the background that <b>innovation</b> capabilities are seen as abstract concepts in practice and {{that the possibility of}} {{a portfolio}} of <b>innovation</b> capabilities exists in organisations as ubiquitous elements of the <b>innovation</b> process. A deeper understanding of <b>innovation</b> capabilities present, in the South African context of <b>innovation,</b> and the challenge to populate {{a portfolio of}} <b>innovation</b> capabilities for successful <b>innovation</b> is paramount. The globalised environment of business, affects the need for <b>innovation</b> at an exponential rate and current core organisational capabilities, culture, environment and processes, may not be conducive to <b>innovation</b> capability building, successful <b>innovation,</b> and even organisational survival. By creating environments that support <b>innovation</b> and by being aware of the symbiosis of capabilities within a portfolio of <b>innovation</b> capabilities, executives and <b>innovation</b> team leaders can manage <b>innovation</b> methods and processes to remain more competitive. The research investigated the executives and <b>innovation</b> leaders views, knowledge and experiences of <b>innovation</b> capabilities and the portfolio of <b>innovation</b> capabilities. The literature review examines the culture of <b>innovation,</b> measures of <b>innovation,</b> capabilities and <b>innovation</b> practices as a means to identify actual <b>innovation</b> capabilities in use. The information attained, was used during the semi-structured interviews with the aim to provide structure and commonality to the practitioners terms and practical experience of <b>innovation.</b> Interviews were conducted with 15 interviewees who consisted of executives and <b>innovation</b> experts who dealt directly with <b>innovation</b> drives within their organisations. The outcome allowed for the identification of <b>innovation</b> capabilities in practice and the articulation of a portfolio of <b>innovation</b> capabilities found in South African organisations. The executives and <b>innovation</b> leaders were forthcoming in sharing their organisations <b>innovation</b> process successes and shortcomings, and communicated their experiences and concerns, pertaining to <b>innovation</b> capabilities within their companies. A model of the ideal portfolio of <b>innovation</b> capabilities (Figure 17) emerged from the findings of the research results. It presents a conceptualised framework of the ten <b>innovation</b> capabilities that were identified and labelled during the data analysis process. The model further depicts the base incubation of <b>innovation</b> culture for the major <b>innovation</b> capabilities presented. The outcome of this research could contribute to executives and <b>innovation</b> leaders facilitation of successful <b>innovation</b> in organisations through the building of portfolios of <b>innovation</b> capabilities, relevant to their industries.

40|$|Organizational <b>innovation</b> {{has been}} of central {{interest}} in recent years because of its importance for organizational survival and competitive advantage. Researchers in the field have divided the <b>innovation</b> process into stages {{in an attempt to}} understand the <b>innovation</b> process and the factors that affect it. However, empirical studies that examine the relationship between the stages are scarce. In addition, although business strategy is emphasized as an important factor in the <b>innovation</b> process, little is known about its role in the <b>innovation</b> process and its effect on the stages. This research provides empirical support for the relationship between the stages of the <b>innovation</b> process and the moderating effect of organizational strategy on the relationship between the stages within the two stage model of <b>innovation.</b> In this study, a direct, positive relationship is proposed between the <b>innovation</b> generation (first stage) and <b>innovation</b> outcome (second stage) stages of the <b>innovation</b> process. Dimensions of <b>innovation</b> outcome that are examined include <b>innovation</b> type (product <b>innovation</b> and process <b>innovation),</b> <b>innovation</b> radicalness and <b>innovation</b> frequency. Low cost, differentiation and market orientation strategies are proposed to be moderators on the relationship between the stages. To test the proposed relationships, a survey was mailed to executives who are involved in the <b>innovation</b> process in organizations where <b>innovation</b> is expected to be common and they were asked to complete the questionnaire. Hierarchical regression was the primary data analysis method and General Linear Model was applied as the pot-hoc data analysis method. Results of the primary data analyses provided support for the direct, positive relationship between the <b>innovation</b> generation and <b>innovation</b> outcome stages of the <b>innovation</b> process. Specifically, there was a direct, positive relationship between <b>innovation</b> generation and product <b>innovation,</b> process <b>innovation,</b> <b>innovation</b> frequency and <b>innovation</b> radicalness. Result of the primary data analysis provided support for the moderating effect of strategy (market orientation and differentiation) on the relationship between <b>innovation</b> generation and only <b>innovation</b> frequency dimension of <b>innovation</b> outcome. Post-hoc analysis suggested a significant moderating effect of strategy (market orientation and differentiation) on the relationship between <b>innovation</b> generation and <b>innovation</b> radicalness dimension of <b>innovation</b> outcome.
