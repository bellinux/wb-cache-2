The Central Pacific <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> began on June1, covering tropical cyclone formation in the region between 140°W and International Dateline.

5|$|As {{stated by}} NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> between 19812010 {{contains}} roughly 12tropical storms, 6hurricanes, 3major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index of 66103 units.

5|$|Before {{and during}} each <b>hurricane</b> <b>season,</b> several {{forecasts}} of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts.

According to NOAA, the average Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> between 1950 and 2005 contained 10.3 tropical storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.7 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 66–103 units.

5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season.</b> Though {{the beginning of the}} annual <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> has historically remained the same, the official end of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> has shifted from its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season,</b> which formed on January3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December2012.|$|E

5|$|The 1914 Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> was {{the least}} active Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> on record, with only one known {{tropical}} storm. Although <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> typically encompasses a much larger time-span, actual activity was confined {{to the middle of}} September. The only tropical cyclone of the year developed in the region of The Bahamas on September 15 and drifted northwestward, moving inland over Florida and Georgia. Thorough warnings before the storm prevented any major damage. The 1914 season is one of only two that did not produce any hurricanes (the other being the 1907 season). Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and an additional tropical depression may have existed in late October. Additionally, this was the first <b>hurricane</b> <b>season</b> to take place during World War I.|$|E
