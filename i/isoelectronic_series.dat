40|$|After {{almost a}} century since the postulation of quantum mechanics, the only {{chemical}} systems that can be treated exactly are those with one electron. For all many-electron problems we rely on approximate solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation. The single largest error in the calculations {{is due to the}} lack of an accurate representation of what happens when two electrons come close together. How the motion of one electron is affected by that of the other electron is referred to as electron correlation. Not only is electron correlation a fundamental problem in quantum chemistry, it is also crucial in determining the important chemical effects. The correlated motion of electrons with opposite spins, completely neglected in single-determinantal Hartree-Fock theory, remains as one of the central unsolved challenges in quantum chemistry. Simple models that can account for the missing correlation energy have been investigated for the <b>isoelectronic</b> atomic <b>series</b> of two to eighteen electrons in order to gain further insight into the form of a correlation operator. The strength of the electron correlation likely depends on both their separation in position space and their separation in momentum space; hence, it is expected that the correlation energy is related to the average inter-electron distance and to their kinetic energy. It has been previously shown that the average electron-electron distance is inversely proportional to the Coulomb energy; thus, the correlation energy was modelled as a function of Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energies. Additionally, application of the atomic correlation models to the modeling of the correlation energy for simple molecular systems have been explored...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the structural, thermodynamic, and electronic transport properties of the <b>isoelectronic</b> chemical substitution <b>series</b> Ce(Pd_ 1 -xNi_x) _ 2 P_ 2 is reported, where a ferromagnetic quantum critical point is uncovered in the temperature - concentration (T-x) phase diagram. This behavior results from the simultaneous contraction of the unit cell volume, which tunes the relative strengths of the Kondo and RKKY interactions, {{and the introduction of}} disorder through alloying. Consistent with this picture, x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal a transformation from CePd_ 2 P_ 2 having a purely trivalent cerium f-state to CeNi_ 2 P_ 2 having a small amount of tetravalent character. In the quantum critical region near x_cr ≈ 0. 7, there is a breakdown of Fermi liquid behavior, signaling the influence of quantum fluctuations. Measurements of clean CePd_ 2 P_ 2 furthermore show that applied pressure has a similar initial effect to alloying on the ferromagnetic order. From these results, CePd_ 2 P_ 2 emerges as a keystone system to test theories such as the Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta model for ferromagnetic quantum criticality, where distinct behaviors are expected in the dirty and clean limits.

The energies of the νCO band for the metal carbonyls correlates {{with the strength}} of the carbon-oxygen bond, and inversely correlated with {{the strength of the}} &pi;-backbonding between the metal and the carbon. The π basicity of the metal center depends on a lot of factors; in the <b>isoelectronic</b> <b>series</b> (Ti to Fe) at the bottom of this section, the hexacarbonyls show decreasing π-backbonding as one increases (makes more positive) the charge on the metal. π-Basic ligands increase π-electron density at the metal, and improved backbonding reduces νCO.
