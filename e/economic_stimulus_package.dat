5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension. The MTA indicated that the 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package.</b> In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> in EU {{countries}} and the Italian case - The article discusses the role of fiscal policies acting {{on the supply side}} within the recent <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> of the EU countries, detailed according to OECD methodology and data. The supply side feature is analyzed according to the goals of the "new European industrial policy". <b>Economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> differ rather largely among countries in terms of size. Worthwhile features are: a) the supply side involvement often accounts for {{less than half of the}} whole package, the majority being focalized on the defence of income and purchasing power of the weaker population; b) a preference towards specific sectors occurs only for the automotive (of course in the car producing countries) and construction industries; c) a long term perspective (related to innovation, energy and environment) seems to be present only in few countries; d) concern about dangers from a new protectionism pushed by the State subsidies seems overstated. The Italian package is rather small: its size is justified by the high Italian debt/GDP ratio, but it cannot be explained according to perspectives on expected performance.

25|$|Obama {{began to}} {{formally}} create his presidential footprint {{during his first}} 100 days. Obama quickly began attempting to foster support for his <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package,</b> American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The bill passed in the House on January 28, 2009, by a 244–188 vote, and it passed in the Senate on February 10 by a 61–37 margin.|$|E
25|$|On 11 September 2008, Ma's cabinet {{unveiled}} a $5.6-billion USD ($180-billion TWD) <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package.</b> Among the {{items of the}} package were infrastructure projects, economic incentives to small businesses, and other tax cuts. Stock transaction taxes were also halved {{for the next six}} months. Taiwan's economy was projected to grow 4.3% in 2008, down from 5.7 in 2007, according to Fitch Ratings.|$|E

25|$|Bachelet {{was widely}} {{credited}} for resisting calls from politicians {{from her own}} coalition to spend the huge copper revenues to close the country’s income gap. Instead in 2007 she created the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund, a sovereign wealth fund which accumulates fiscal surpluses which are above 1% of GDP. This strategy allowed her to finance new social policies and provide <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> when the 2008 financial crisis hit the country.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, Schiff said he {{supported}} the reduction of government economic regulation and was concerned that the Obama administration might instead increase such regulation. Schiff says that the late-2000s financial crisis provides an opportunity to transition from borrowing and spending to saving and producing. He is critical of the US government's efforts to [...] "ease the pain" [...] with <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> and bailout, as he believes that replacing [...] "legitimate savings with a printing press" [...] could result in hyperinflation.|$|R
25|$|On February 17, 2009, Obama {{signed into}} law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787billion <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> aimed at helping the economy recover from the {{deepening}} worldwide recession. The act included increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. Democrats overwhelmingly supported this measure, while only a few Senate Republicans supported the law.|$|E
25|$|Hill {{voted against}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("Wall Street bailout"). Hill {{supported}} the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey), a cap-and-trade bill which ultimately did not pass. Hill also voted for the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (an <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> championed by President Obama) and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, landmark health care reform legislation.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> and 2010 {{health care reform}} bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the Obama administration. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E
40|$|Infrastructure {{investment}} {{has been an}} important element in the <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> introduced to try and deal with the effects of the recession. It is reinforced by the need to develop sustainable energy sources, and by the development needs of countries in the south. Public sector finance – tax revenues and bonds – remain the main way of financing such investment. The use of PPP projects to finance and operate infrastructure services, and the development of infrastructure funds as a way of investing in them, are both dangerous and unnecessary...|$|R
50|$|The {{risks to}} the broader economy created by the housing market {{downturn}} and subsequent financial market crisis were primary factors in several decisions by central banks {{around the world to}} cut interest rates and governments to implement <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages.</b> Effects on global stock markets due to the crisis were dramatic. Between 1 January and 11 October 2008, owners of stocks in U.S. corporations suffered about $8 trillion in losses, as their holdings declined in value from $20 trillion to $12 trillion. Losses in other countries averaged about 40%.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a major global {{challenge}} and governments {{around the world are}} now promoting environmental technologies to address both climate change and realize new employment and growth opportunities in this rapidly expanding area. Investments have reached unprecedented levels and <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> to tackle the recent economic crisis also contain noticeable commitments to green technologies. Innovation policies are now under pressure to capitalize these investments and define priorities in the application of environmental technologies to both boost competitiveness and eco-innovation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify foreseen impacts of growing environmental technology investments, 'green' components of <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> and the ideas of a 'Global Green New Deal' and 'Green Growth' and to assess how Finland is positioned in environmental technologies. The paper reviews existing studies, analyzes global and Finnish patenting and considers the role of environmental technologies in its industrial context in Finland. The findings suggest that renewable energy is the most rapidly expanding environmental technology area, while the <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> will play a lesser role than originally anticipated in transitions to low-carbon economies. Finland is comparatively well positioned in environmental technologies by overall levels of patenting activity. Nonetheless, Finland does not have a specific specialization profile in the area, neither a comparative advantage in renewable energy technologies as the most rapidly expanding fields globally. Environmental technologies are developed in the context of a broad range of Finnish industries whereby the application potentials of these technologies are manifold...|$|R
25|$|By comparison, Bill Clinton {{only had}} one {{outstanding}} Cabinet confirmation {{at the end of}} his first day in office and George W. Bush had all but one approved before February 1, 2001. Ronald Reagan had twelve of thirteen Cabinet members confirmed before February 1, and Jimmy Carter had all eleven of his confirmed. George H. W. Bush only had seven of thirteen confirmed by this time. Whereas his predecessors had to trade favours for contentious approvals such as Zoe Baird (Clinton), John Tower (G.H.W. Bush), or John Ashcroft (G.W. Bush), Obama has largely focused on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a proposed <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> totalling nearly $1 trillion.|$|E
25|$|He {{brought about}} a top-to-bottom {{restructuring}} of the country's courts to introduce, among other things, review of judicial decisions and more professional training for Shari'a judges. He developed a new investment promotion agency to overhaul the once-convoluted process of starting a business in Saudi Arabia and created a regulatory body for capital markets. He also promoted {{the construction of the}} King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (the country's new flagship and controversially co-ed institution for advanced scientific research). King Abdullah invested in educating the workforce for future jobs. The Saudi government also encouraged the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors in which the Kingdom had a comparative advantage, including mining, solar energy, and religious tourism. The Kingdom's 2010 budget reflected these priorities—about 25 percent was devoted to education alone—and amounts to a significant <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
25|$|Taiwan has {{recovered}} quickly {{from the global}} financial crisis of 2007–2010, and its economy has been growing steadily. Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets. Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008. In response, the government launched a US$5.6 billion <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> (3% of its GDP), provided financial incentives for businesses, and introduced tax breaks. The stimulus package focused on infrastructure development, small and medium-sized businesses, tax breaks for new investments, and low-income households. Boosting shipments to new overseas markets, such as Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East was also a main goal of the stimulus. The economy has since slowly recovered; by November 2010, Taiwan's unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low of 4.73%, and continued dropping to a 40-month low of 4.18% by the end of 2011. The average salary has also been rising steadily for each month in 2010, up 1.92% from the same period in 2009. Industrial output for November 2010 reached another high, up 19.37% from a year earlier, indicating strong exports and a growing local economy. Private consumption is also increasing, with retail sales up 6.4% compared to 2009. After 10.5% economic growth in 2010, the World Bank expected growth to continue and reach 5% for 2011.|$|E
25|$|India's economy {{benefited from}} recent high {{economic}} growth which declined greatly {{due to the}} global economic crisis. Economic growth in India during FY2008-09 stood at 6.7%. The global crisis had less impact of India because exports account for only 15% of India's GDP, {{less than half the}} levels of major Asian economic powers such as China and Japan. However, unlike other major Asian economies, India's government finances were in poor shape and as a consequence, it was not able to enact large-scale <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages.</b> Despite this, from June 2008 to June 2009, industrial production in India grew by 7.1%.|$|R
50|$|In {{times of}} {{economic}} trouble or uncertainty, the government often tries {{to rectify the}} issue by distributing <b>economic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> often {{in the form of}} rebates or checks. However such techniques have failed in the past for several reasons. As was discussed earlier, temporary financial reprieve rarely succeeds because people do not often like rapidly shifting their spending habits. Also, people are many times intelligent enough to realize that <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages</b> are due to economic downturns, and therefore they are even more reluctant to spend them. Instead they put them into savings, which can potentially also help spur the economy. By putting money into savings, banks profit and are able to decrease the interest rates, which then encourage others to save less and promote future spending.|$|R

The Rudd Government's first acts included signing the Kyoto Protocol and delivering an apology to Indigenous Australians for the Stolen Generations. The previous government's industrial relations legislation, WorkChoices, was largely dismantled, Australia's remaining Iraq War combat personnel were withdrawn, and the [...] "Australia 2020 Summit" [...] was held. In response to the global financial crisis, the government provided <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages,</b> and Australia {{was one of the few}} developed countries to avoid the late-2000s recession.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, McCain {{emerged as}} a leader of the Republican {{opposition}} to the Obama <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> of 2009, saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect. McCain also voted against Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor – saying that while undeniably qualified, [...] "I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint" [...] – and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career. McCain reasserted that the War in Afghanistan was winnable and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there.|$|E
500|$|Both {{candidates}} {{started the}} campaign well-funded. Sestak {{had more than}} $3 million available from his House fund to use toward starting a Senate campaign, and raised an additional $1 million by June 30, 2009, which brought his total to about $4.2 million. Sestak called it the largest campaign war-chest of any Senate challenger. Specter, however, was ahead with $6.7 million in campaign funding as of March 31. Sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and Specter's support among high-profile members of the Democratic establishment, like Obama and Biden. Specter spent {{the early months of}} his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his Democratic credentials, seeking union support and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by the party, such as the <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package,</b> reforming health care, increasing the minimum wage, protecting abortion rights and supporting stem cell research. In a June 2009 speech to Pennsylvania Democratic Committee members in Pittsburgh, Specter said, [...] "I'm again a Democrat and I'm pleased and proud to be a Democrat." [...] Commentators observed that Sestak's involvement in the race would test Specter's loyalty to the Democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal votes in the Senate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} of the <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>package's</b> Broadband Technology Opportunities Program to eliminate inequalities in internet access and quality of access in the United States. President Obama's broadband objectives are situated within their wider historical context: three-quarters of American adults are now online and more than half have broadband access at home, the "digital divide " is being bridged and high-speed access and mobile connectivity are becoming a reality for more and more users. Still, some users who want to make the switch to broadband are stuck with dial-up modems and frustratingly slow connections, and an even larger segment of the population remains offline.

5000|$|Abhisit {{responded to}} the crisis with two <b>economic</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>packages.</b> [...] The {{government}} announced the first, 117-billion-baht <b>stimulus</b> <b>package</b> in January 2009. The package included a one-time issuance of 2,000 baht (approximately US$75) checks to people making less than 15,000 baht (approximately US$500) a month. [...] A training program, dubbed [...] "Ton Kla A-cheep" [...] was initiated for up to 500,000 new graduates and unemployed people. Free government education was expanded to up to 15 years, as written in the constitution, saving approximately 2,000 baht per term per student. A pension of 500 baht a month was provided to those aged 60 and above. Price guarantees were instituted to subsidize rice, corn, and tapioca farmers. The government provided funds to villages nationwide to carry out projects based on King Bhumibol's sufficiency economy philosophy.|$|R
