5000|$|The Court is {{composed}} of one member from each EU state, each of whom is—after a hearing in the Budgetary Control Committee and a non-binding majority-vote in the committee {{as well as in}} the plenary of the European Parliament—appointed unanimously by the Council of the European Union for a renewable term of six years. They are not all replaced every six years, however, as their terms do not coincide (four of the original members began with reduced terms of four years for this reason). Members are chosen from people who have served in national audit bodies, who are qualified for the office and whose <b>independence</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt.</b> While serving in the Court, members cannot engage in any other professional activities. As the body is independent, its members are free to decide their own organisation and rules of procedure, although these must be ratified by the Council of the European Union. Since the Treaty of Nice, the Court can set up [...] "chambers" [...] (with only a few Members each) to adopt certain types of reports or opinions.|$|E
5000|$|The EFTA Court {{consists}} of 3 permanent judges. Each EEA/EFTA State {{has the right}} to nominate one candidate for the position. The Judges are appointed by common accord of the governments of the EEA/EFTA States for a renewable term of six years. In 2016, Norway tried to reelect Per Christiansen for a term of only three years, officially to stay in line with the Norwegian age limit of 70, but it bowed for the criticism it sought to punish him for ruling against Oslo in a series of controversial cases. The judges are chosen from persons whose <b>independence</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> and who possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices in their respective countries or who are jurisconsults of recognized competence. A further six ad hoc judges are also chosen, pursuant to Article 30 SCA. One of the six ad hoc judge is called upon to sit if a regular judge is prevented from participating in a case due to bias or illness. Each judge has his or her cabinet which {{consists of}} the judge and at least one legal secretary and an administrative assistant. The following is a list of current and former EFTA Court Judges: ...|$|E
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{has some}} basic {{structural}} features {{similar to that}} of most judicial bodies. According to the treaties, the members of the Court are chosen from individuals whose <b>independence</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> and who possess the ability required for appointment to higher judicial offices. The involvement of the Court and its president in the most important reforms of the European Union's judicial architecture in recent years is a striking feature which may be called judicial self-government. International courts have shifted away from being principally committed to dispute settlement towards pursuing other goals, such as advancing international norms and facilitating cooperative international arrangements. The reinforcement of the cooperation of the Court with national courts on the one hand, and with international courts and tribunals on the other, {{is one of the great}} current challenges facing the Court...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{differences}} between {{the nation and the}} city is the way they figure as representable imagined totalities. Nations are the common cultural appendages of that dominant geopolitical entity of the modern world, the nation-state, whose privileged existence is founded on the principles of territorial sovereignty, self-determination and internal autonomy. As such, nations are commonly thought of as bounded, sovereign collective subjects whose right to <b>independence</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt.</b> It is on behalf of the nation’s way of life, identity and security that nation-states engage in patrolling, defending and controlling their boundaries – in what in recent Australian history has come to be dubbed ‘border protection’. In this country, the drama of national sovereignty reached a climax in August 2001, when a Norwegian ship, the Tampa, with 400 Middle Eastern asylum seekers on board, was not allowed to land on Australian territory.

The point <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt,</b> and it <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> that, in many regions, the stones, and the slats of wood, may be inscribed with archaic markings, or may be uninscribed.
