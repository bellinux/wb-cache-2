40|$|What is {{the role}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt in precipitating {{financial}} crises? In this paper we assemble data for nearly 30 countries between 1880 and 1913 and examine debt crises, currency crises, banking crises and twin crises.

We find fairly robust evidence that more <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt leads to a higher chance of having a debt crisis or a banking crisis. However, a key finding is that countries with noticeably different backgrounds, and strong institutions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and the US deftly managed their exposure to hard currency debt, generally avoided having too many crises and never had severe financial meltdowns. Moreover, a strong reserve position matched up to hard <b>currency</b> <b>liabilities</b> seems to be correlated with a lower likelihood of a debt crisis, currency crisis or a banking crisis. This strengthens the evidence for the hypothesis that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt is dangerous when mis-managed.

Finally we discuss the robustness of these results to local idiosyncrasies and the implications from this representative historical sample. ...|$|R

40|$|Financial dollarisation, {{defined as}} the holding by {{residents}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> assets and <b>liabilities,</b> has been placed {{at the forefront of}} the policy debate in developing economies. The reasons include its alleged influence on the conduct of monetary policy and, most prominently, the deleterious impact of exchange rate depreciations on the solvency of dollar debtors (the balance sheet effect). However, the vast analytical literature on these issues contrasts with the scarcity of empirical work to support or refute these implications. This paper contributes to fill this gap. Using a new updated database, the paper revisits the evidence on the determinants of financial dollarisation, and tests whether the impact on monetary and financial stability, and economic performance predicted by the theory is verified in the data. It finds that financially dollarised economies display a more unstable demand for money, a greater propensity to suffer banking crises after a depreciation of the local currency, and slower and more volatile output growth, without significant gains in terms of domestic financial depth. In this light, the case for an active de-dollarisation policy is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the role}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt in precipitating {{financial}} crises? In this paper we compare the 1880 to 1913 period to recent experience. We examine debt crises, currency crises, banking crises and the interrelation between these varieties of crises. We pay special attention to the role of hard currency debt, currency mismatches and debt intolerance. We find fairly robust evidence that high exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt does not necessarily lead to a high chance of having a debt crisis, currency crisis, or a banking crisis. A key finding is some countries do not suffer from great financial fragility despite high exposure to original sin. In the nineteenth century, the British offshoots and Scandinavia generally avoided severe financial meltdowns while today many advanced countries have high original sin but have had few financial crises. The common denominator in both periods is that currency mismatches matter. A strong reserve position or high exports relative to hard <b>currency</b> <b>liabilities</b> helps decrease the likelihood of a debt crisis, currency crisis or a banking crisis. This strengthens the evidence for the hypothesis that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt is dangerous when mis-managed. We discuss the robustness of these results and make some general comparisons based on this evidence from over 60 years of intense international capital market integration. ...|$|R
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate.

In countries with significant currency mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} idea that “Fear of Floating” and {{accompanying}} pro-cyclical interest rate policies observed {{in the case of}} some emerging market economies may be justified as an optimal discretionary monetary policy response to shocks. The paper also examines how the differences in monetary policies may lead to different degrees of this fear. These questions are addressed with a small open economy, new- Keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation and sticky prices. The economy consists of two sectors- traded and non-traded. International credit markets are assumed to be imperfect, so that only the traded sector enjoys the ability to borrow internationally in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The firms in the traded sector could potentially hold a large proportion of their debt in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> while the <b>liabilities</b> of the non-traded sector firms are entirely denominated in the domestic currency. Domestic exchange rate volatility adversely affects the balance sheets of the traded sector firms, while interest rate volatility creates problems for the firms in the non-traded sector. In such a situation, the monetary authorities face a dilemma when reacting to shocks. The numerical solution of the model indicates that the central bank’s reaction to shocks depends not only on the net effect of exchange rate movements on output gap and inflation, but also on the relative weight the central bank allocates to stabilizing output in the traded sector as against the non-traded sector. A central bank that assigns relatively higher importance to output stability in the traded goods sector also displays greater aversion for exchange rate volatility. fear of floating, exchange rates, exchnage rate volatility, monetary policy, emerging countries...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{two aspects}} of firm behavior in emerging markets. Chapters 1 and 3 consider the decision of firms to borrow in domestic or <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> {{and the implications of}} this decision on fixed capital and inventory investment. Chapter 2 explores the effects of institutions, via transaction costs, on the variety of intermediate goods used by firms in different economies, and the effects of this choice on productivity levels. Much has been written recently about the problems for emerging markets that might result from a mismatch between <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated <b>liabilities</b> and assets (or income flows) denominated in local currency. In particular, several models, developed in the aftermath of financial crises of the late 1990 's, suggest that the expansion in the "peso" value of "dollar" liabilities resulting from a devaluation either aggravated or triggered many of the recent financial crises. However, little evidence has been presented either on the effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt on investment or the variables that affect firm level debt choice in the first place. Two of the papers in this dissertation (Chapters 1 and 3) attempt to fill this gap using a new database with accounting information (including the <b>currency</b> composition of <b>liabilities)</b> for close to 400 non-financial firms in five Latin American countries. In Chapter 1 (coauthored with Hoyt Bleakley) we estimate, at the firm level, the reduced-form effect on investment of holding <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> denominated debt during an exchange rate realignment. We consistently find that this effect is positive, contrary to the predicted sign of the net-worth effect. (cont.) Additionally, we show that the estimated coefficient can be decomposed into competitiveness and net-worth effects, and provide direct evidence that the competitiveness effect dominates the net-worth effect. We argue that the positive response of investment is the result of firms debt choice decisions. If those firms holding dollar debt are also those firms whose current and future incomes benefit most from a devaluation then {{it is not surprising that}} the contractionary balance sheet effects of devaluations are more than offset by expansionary competitiveness effects. In Chapter 3 I explore the issue of debt choice in more detail with the help of a simple model of debt composition. In the model, firms hedge against exchange rate shocks by altering the currency mix of their liabilities. Within a sample of non-financial Latin American firms I find that firms holding dollar debt are those whose income we expect a priori to be more highly correlated with the exchange rate. I also find evidence that firms holding dollar debt are less credit constrained. Finally, I explore variations across countries and over time in the determinants and levels of dollarization. Within the sample of Latin American corporations I find that exchange rate stability has a significant positive effect on the level of dollarization. All three empirical findings are consistent with a model of debt composition in which credit constraints lead to risk averse behavior by firms Although there is growing evidence of the role of institutions in explaining cross country differences in income per capita, there is still little evidence as to the precise mechanisms by which institutions affect economic outcomes [...] . by Kevin Cowan.

Greater ratios of foreign currency debt to total debt are associated with increased risks of currency and debt crises, although the strength of the association depends crucially on the size of a country's reserve base and its policy credibility.

40|$|The paper {{employs a}} post-Kaleckian model {{to address the}} {{question}} of how currency devaluations affect aggregate demand, capital accumulation, and debt in an economy with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>liabilities.</b> In benchmark post-Kaleckian open economy models currency devaluations have two key effects. First, they change international price competitiveness and thus affect net exports. Second, devaluations change income distribution and thereby affect consumption and investment demand. The overall effect on aggregate demand and investment is ambiguous and depends on parameter values. Existing models, however, disregard balance sheet effects that arise from foreign currency-denominated external debt. The paper develops a novel post-Kaleckian open economy model that introduces foreign currency-denominated external debt and balance sheet effects. The model is then used to analyse the effects of a currency devaluation on aggregate demand, growth, and debt dynamics in small open economies with a fixed exchange rate in the short- to medium-run. The main findings are that the existence of foreign currency-denominated debt means that devaluations are more likely to take a contractionary form, and that foreign interest rate hikes, and high illiquidity and risk premia compromise debt sustainability. Devaluations only stabilise debt ratios if they succeed in boosting domestic capital accumulation...|$|E
