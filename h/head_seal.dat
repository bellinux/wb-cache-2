2500|$|George Ravenscroft (1618–1681) was {{the first}} to produce clear lead crystal {{glassware}} on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and {{under the auspices of the}} Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term flint glass to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand. At first, his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition. He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production [...] moved from his glasshouse in the precinct of the Savoy, London, to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames. In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven’s <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing flint glass containing 30–35% PbO.|$|E

Ravenscroft announced in 1676 that the [...] "crizzling" [...] problem had been resolved and that the new, improved glass vessels would bear a raven’s <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> to distinguish them from earlier, faulty pieces. A small number (less than twenty) of glass vessels bearing the raven’s <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> exist today, some of which have crizzled and some of which have not.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{popularity}} of the stickers led to trouble for the series. The zeal for trying to obtain <b>Head</b> <b>Seals</b> would lead children to buy Bikkuriman in mass quantities, retrieve the stickers inside, and simply throw away the snack. This, along with the fact that children and collectors were willing to pay high amounts of money for the rarer cards, led to parent groups expressing concern of possible gambling undertones to the stickers. This led to action by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, and the number of <b>Head</b> <b>Seals</b> per pack was increased from the average 4 to 24 individual Seals.|$|R

50|$|More pieces {{created by}} Ravenscroft may exist, {{but in the}} absence of the raven’s <b>head</b> <b>seal,</b> which he stopped using in about 1677, or any {{descriptions}} or drawings of his designs, it is difficult to positively attribute particular pieces to him. Some pieces thought to strongly resemble Ravenscroft’s work bear an “S” seal; some have suggested that the “S” stands for “Savoy,” Ravenscroft’s main production facility, while others believe that the “S” stands for “Southwark, or Savoy, as he had a glassworks close to the Savoy Chapel ruins” indicating the South London glass works of John Bowles and William Lillington. There may be around forty glass items made by Ravenscroft using his new lead recipe, but less than twenty with the raven's seal.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} failure {{mechanism}} of pneumatic cylinders {{is related to}} wear of head seals. It usually occurs due to excessive radial loads or vibrations (dynamic run-out) or as consequence of an incorrect mounting (rod to bore misalignment). Sealing behaviour has been the object of several analytical and numerical studies orientated to reproduce actual working conditions but perfect rod alignment has been often considered. A tri-dimensional quasi-static numerical model of rod radial misalignment {{and its effect on}} facing seal behaviour is herein presented as a first step of a study concerning mounting effects on <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> performances. In the specific, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) rod lip seal has been considered. An analytical model was also developed considering the characteristics of the rubber-like material and stiffness variation of the lip seal versus deformation. A non-linear dependence of stiffness on deformation of rubber-like material was found. A cross validation between analytical and numerical models is provided...|$|E

40|$|After the {{discovery}} of cooling system leak of about 284 liters per twenty-four (24) hour period, an investigation determined that the 76. 2 -cm diameter, 33. 5 -m long stainless-steel (304) OWR delay line was losing water at the same nominal rate. An excavation effort revealed that a circumferential crack, approximately 0. 0025 cm in width, extended around {{the bottom half of}} the delay line. In addition, other evidence of what appeared to be microcracking and pitting that originated at random nucleated sites around the pipe were also found. Results of destructive analysis and nondestructive testing allowed Los Alamos staff to conclude that the direct cause for the main crack and other pitting resulted from stress-assisted, microbial-induced corrosion of the stainless steel primary piping. The results also indicated that microbial action from bacteria that are normally present in earth can be extremely harmful to stainless- steel piping under certain conditions. Other potential problems that could have also eventually led to a permanent shutdown of the OWR were discussed. These problems, although never encountered nor associated with the current shutdown, were identified in aging studies and are associated with: (1) the water-cooled, bismuth gamma-ray shield and, (2) the aluminum thermal column <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> that prevents reactor vessel water from entering into the graphite-filled thermal column...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assure the {{continued}} development of geothermal resources, many advances in materials technology are required so that high costs resulting from the severe environments encountered during drilling, well completion and energy extraction can be reduced. These needs will become more acute as higher temperature and chemically aggressive fluids are encountered. High priority needs are for lost circulation control and lightweight well completion materials, and tools such as drill pipe protectors, rotating <b>head</b> <b>seals,</b> blow-out preventers, and downhole drill motors. The lack of suitable hydrolytically stable chemical systems that can bond previously developed elastomers to metal reinforcement is a critical but as yet unaddressed impediment {{to the development of}} these tools.

50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>sealing</b> so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|R

Akin to the Mars Attacks trading card series from America, the battle between the Tenshi and Akuma is told on the back of each sticker, with the plot progressing with each new set. Each set was divided into several themed tiers featuring a Tenshi, Akuma, and an Omamori (お守り, [...] "Protector"), with an ultra-rare [...] "Head" [...] seal that serves as the main character of its particular set. The <b>Head</b> <b>Seals</b> were typically printed with a prism or holographic holofoil to set them apart from the Tenshi's metallic silver or gold backing, the clear backgrounds of the Omamori and the multi-colored backgrounds of the Akuma. The rarity of the early Akuma vs Tenshi seals were, in order: Head, Tenshi, Omamori, Akuma.|$|R
