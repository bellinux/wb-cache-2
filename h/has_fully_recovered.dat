5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother <b>has</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recovered</b> from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E

5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface <b>has</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E

25|$|Stony Brook’s {{financial}} endowment is {{managed by the}} Stony Brook Foundation. The foundation was established in 1965 as a not-for-profit corporation under the New York State Education Law. Chartered to collect and manage gifts from private and non-state resources to supplement the funding of the University and managed by a voluntary Board of Trustees. Donations {{can be made to}} a wide selection of funds which benefit different areas of the University. In 2012 the endowment was valued at approximately $125 million with total assets amounting to nearly $350 million and <b>has</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recovered</b> from the losses endured in the 2008 economic downturn. After a strong fundraising campaign led by Jim Simon’s $150 million donation, the University amounted to more than $180 million in fundraising for the 2011-12 year and raised $200 million by March 2013. It is the second largest endowment among State University of New York university centers behind the University at Buffalo. However, the university's endowment remains far below the average of its Association of American Universities peers.|$|E

500|$|Caligari was {{released}} {{at a time}} when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called [...] "Cranford", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis <b>has</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recovered</b> from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and [...] "adjusted [...] for mass consumption", though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ernö Rapée to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: [...] "The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country".|$|E

2500|$|Soil holds more carbon than {{vegetation}} and atmosphere combined, and most soil lies under grazing land. Holistic Planned Grazing holds tremendous potential in mitigating global warming, while building soil, increasing biodiversity, and reversing desertification. Developed by Allan Savory, it uses fencing and/or herders, to restore grasslands by carefully planning movements of large herds of livestock {{to mimic the}} vast herds found in nature where grazing animals are kept concentrated by pack predators and forced to move on after eating, trampling, and manuring an area, returning only after it <b>has</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recovered.</b> This method of grazing seeks to emulate what occurred during the past 40 million years as the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems built deep, rich [...] grassland soils, sequestering carbon and cooling the planet.|$|E
