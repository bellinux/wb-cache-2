25|$|Coffee percolators and {{automatic}} coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that {{are held in}} a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> while extracting its oils and essences.

25|$|The espresso method forces hot {{pressurized}} and vaporized {{water through}} <b>ground</b> <b>coffee.</b> As {{a result of}} brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9–10 atm), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface. Other pressurized water methods include the moka pot and vacuum coffee maker.|$|E

In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first Cabernet Franc rosé. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit.

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). <b>Ground</b> <b>coffee</b> and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

2500|$|Turkish {{coffee is}} made by boiling the <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> beans (and is not made, for example, by {{filtering}} or percolation). [...] Its preparation is done by a method that has two characteristic features. [...] First, if sugar is {{to be added to}} the coffee, it is done at the start of the boiling, not after. [...] Second, the boiling is done as slowly as possible, without letting the water get to a state beyond that of simmering. [...] When the grounds begin to froth, about one-third of the coffee is distributed to the various individual cups, after which the remaining two-thirds is returned to the fire. [...] After the coffee froths a second time, the process is completed and the remaining coffee is distributed to the individual cups.|$|E
2500|$|A {{beverage}} called [...] "turecká káva" [...] or [...] "turek" [...] is {{also very}} popular in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, even if more sophisticated forms of coffee preparation (such as espresso) have become widespread {{in the last few}} decades, decreasing the popularity of turek. Cafés usually do not serve turek any more, in contrast to pubs and kiosks, but turek is still often served in households. The Czech and Slovak form of Turkish coffee is different from Turkish coffee in Turkey, the Arab world or Balkan countries, since cezve is not used. It is in fact the simplest possible method to make coffee: <b>ground</b> <b>coffee</b> is poured with boiling or almost boiling water. The weight of coffee and the volume of water depend only on the taste of the consumer.
