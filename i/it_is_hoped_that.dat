5|$|The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 2010 {{with the purpose}} of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model {{posits that}} {{elementary}} particles derive their masses from the Higgs mechanism, which is associated to the Higgs boson. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> further {{research into the}} reasons for the top quark's large mass of ~173GeV/c2, almost the mass of a gold atom, might reveal more about the origin of the mass of quarks and other elementary particles.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|The Wensleydale Railway {{is reached}} by a bus service, {{operated}} by Dales & District, which runs from Northallerton {{to the current}} terminus of the railway at Leeming Bar, from where trains run to Redmire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> eventually passenger trains will connect with the Settle-Carlisle Railway at Garsdale, and that the section of line near Northallerton known as the South Curve can be upgraded to allow trains from Wensleydale to run into Northallerton railway station without reversing onto the main line. At the moment there are some limited goods, engineering and excursion trains using the North Curve.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E

5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the field being narrowed in this manner, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the absence of several previously popular candidates would {{clear the way for}} others; the 10 players elected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1945 had received 26% of the vote in the last BBWAA election, and had included 7 of the top 16 candidates. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the revised approach and reduced field of candidates would result in up to 5 new members of the Hall annually.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, country {{peasantry}} {{were generally}} not {{welcome in the}} city, and so the gates also served to restrict access. [...] However, the country folk were permitted to set up trading posts of their own just outside the gates, and the Potsdam Gate especially. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> this would encourage development of all the country lanes into proper roads; in turn <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> these would emulate Parisian boulevards—broad, straight and magnificent, but the main intention was to enable troops to be moved quickly. Thus Potsdamer Platz was off and running.|$|R

25|$|Coaches or players may {{occasionally}} opt {{to commit}} an infraction on purpose.
