40|$|Using a crossed {{electron}} beam-molecular beam scattering {{geometry and}} a relative-flow technique, ratios of elastic <b>differential</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> of CO {{to those of}} He have been measured at electron impact energies of 3, 5, 7. 5, 9. 9, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, and 100 eV. At each energy, an angular range of 15 to 130 deg has been covered. These ratios have been multiplied by previously known He elastic <b>differential</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> to obtain elastic <b>differential</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for CO. Since pure rotational excitations were not resolved, the elastic <b>differential</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> are a sum of elastic and pure rotational excitations at room temperature. From a knowledge of <b>differential</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> (DCS), integral and momentum transfer <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> have been calculated.
