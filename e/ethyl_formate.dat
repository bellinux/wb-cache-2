40|$|Interest in {{indirect}} (secondary) refrigeration {{systems has}} grown since {{the discovery of}} the negative effect of environmentally hazardous refrigerants and leakage problems from direct expansion systems. Among the positive effects of indirect systems are: decreased quantities of primary refrigerant, factory built units and confinement of refrigerant to the machine room. Ground source heat pumps, ice rink and indirect system solutions for supermarket refrigeration are examples where indirect refrigeration systems are being used in Sweden. The secondary fluids circulating in the secondary systems are of great interest as its choice can affect heat transfer process; the overall performance of system; corrosion problems and maintenance costs as well as acceptable risks for the environment in case of leakage from the secondary system. A secondary fluid should have low viscosity, high thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity, low freezing point, be non-corrosive, non-explosive, non-flammable, environmentally friendly, non-toxic, give low pressure drop in the system, have good material compatibility, chemically stable and have low cost. The market for secondary fluids worldwide and in Sweden is complex and a comprehensive overview of the available secondary fluids has not been available.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the gas phase oxidation of the lower aliphatic esters and of propane. The kinetics of the oxidation of methyl, <b>ethyl,</b> and propyl <b>formate,</b> methyl acetate, methyl propionate and methyl butyrate were determined at various temperatures from 280 ° to 450 °C. The experiments were made in a silica reaction vessel and the pressure changes accompanying oxidation were followed on a mercury manometer. The pressure-time curves usually showed an induction period after which the rate of change of pressure in the reaction vessel increased up to a maximum. Two temperature ranges of reactivity were observed with <b>ethyl</b> and propyl <b>formate,</b> methyl butyrate and propane. The rate of oxidation increased smoothly with increasing temperature up to about 350 Â°C. Between 350 Â° and 400 °C. the rate decreased rapidly with an increase in temperature. Above 400 Â°C. the rate increased continuously until ignition occurred. At all temperatures, an increase in the initial concentration of the combustible material increased the rate of oxidation and decreased the induction period. In the high temperature region an increase in the oxygen concentration similarly increased the rate of oxidation. In the low temperature region the rate of oxidation was independent of the oxygen concentration. Except at very low partial pressures of oxygen the induction period was independent of ths oxygan concentration in both the low and high temperature regions. A mass spectrometer was used to analyse the combustion gases for the unchanged ester (or propane), for residual oxygen, and for the amount of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formed. At all temperatures the concentrations of the major constituents were directly proportional to the pressure changes measured in the reaction vessel. Sufficient experiments were made to establish the pressure measurements as a true measure of the oxidation process. Chemical and polarographic analyses were made for formaldehyde, aoetaldehyde, total acid and peroxide substances. In each case the concentration of the intermediate species passed through a maximum as the reaction went to completion. No significant oxidation was detected during the induction period. The outstanding feature of the general kinetics of the esters was the marked dependence of the rate of oxidation, in the low temperature region, on the molecular structure of the combustible material. An increase in the carbon chain length increased the rate of oxidation much more than would have been expected from tue normal organic chemistry of a homologous series. The effect was most pronounced between the esters of higher molecular weight. An increase in the carbon chain length on the ethereal side of the ester configuration had a much greater effect than a corresponding increase on the carbonyl side. Where only methyl groups, and no metnylene groups occurred, the ease of oxidation wae greatly reduced. The kinetic results are interpreted in terms of a series of reaction steps analogous to those proposed by Cullis and Hinshelwood for paraffin oxidation. The scheme postulates the formation of peroxide substances capable, in the low temperature region, of decomposition and the propogation of a branching chain reaction. The rate expression for the oxidation reaction is of the form f([O 2], [RH]) l - 2 kF The remarkable effects of the substituent groups are attributed largely to the effect of the structural changes on the rate of decomposition, k, of the peroxide species. The theories of Walsh and Norrish are discussed in relation to the experimental evidence of the present investigation. The analytical investigation of the cool flame mixtures of propane indicated that the products of cool flame combustion are very similar to those detected in the low temperature region of oxidation. The changes in the concentrations of the initial reagents and final products followed the same pattern as that observed at lower temperatures. The polarograme of the combustion samples collected immediately before, and after, the occurrence of a cool flame, showed a marked decrease in the concentration of peroxide material with the explosion. The analyses support the theory of Hardwell and Hinshelwood, that oool flakes result from the self-heating of the gas mixture by the thermal decomposition of the peroxide intermediates. The general scheme proposed is R- + 0 2 = R 00 - R 00 - + RH = R 00 H + R- R 00 H = R 0 - + - 0 H where the temperature coefficient of the rate of decomposition of the peroxide is greater than that of the rate of formation. If the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic, under appropriate conditions of concentration and reaction temperature, self-heating would be expected, and the rate would increase rapidly until the peroxide substances are largely consumed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hot cores in {{molecular}} clouds, such as Orion KL, Sgr B 2, W 51 e 1 /e 2, {{are characterized}} {{by the presence of}} molecules at temperature high enough to significantly populate their low-frequency vibrationally excited states. For complex organic molecules, characterized by a dense spectrum both in the ground state and in the excited states, such as methyl <b>formate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> cyanide or dimethyl ether, lines from vibrationally excited states certainly participate to the spectral confusion. Aims. Thanks to the recent laboratory study of the first torsional excited mode of methyl formate, we have searched for methyl formate, HCOOCH 3, in its first torsionally excited state (υt= 1) in the molecular cloud W 51 e 2. Methods. We have performed observations of the molecular cloud W 51 e 2 in different spectral regions at 1. 3, 2 and 3 mm with the IRAM 30 m single dish antenna. Results. Methyl formate in its first torsionally excited state (υt= 1 at 131 cm− 1) is detected for the first time toward W 51 e 2. 82 transitions have been detected among which 46 are unblended with other species. For a total of 16 A-E pairs in the observed spectrum, 9 are unblended; these 9 pairs are all detected. All transitions from excited methyl formate within the observed spectral range are actually detected and no strong lines are missing. The column density of the excited state is comparable to that of the ground state. For a source size of 7 ′′we find that Trot = 104 ± 14 K and N = 9. 4 + 4. 0 − 2. 8 × 1016 cm− 2 for the excited state and Trot = 176 ± 24 K and N = 1. 7 +. 2 −. 2 × 1017 cm− 2 for the ground state. Lines from ethyl cyanide in its two first excited states (υt= 1, torsion mode at 212 cm− 1) and (υb= 1, CCN in-plane bending mode at 206 cm− 1) are also present in the observed spectrum. However blending problems prevent a precise estimate of its abundance. However as for methyl formate it should be comparable with the ground state for which we find Trot = 103 ± 9 K and N = 3. 7 + 0. 6 − 0. 4 × 1015 cm− 2 for a 7 ′′source size. Conclusions. With regard to the number of lines of excited methyl <b>formate</b> and <b>ethyl</b> cyanide detected in W 51 e 2, it appears that excited states of large molecules certainly account for a large number of unidentified lines in spectral survey of molecular clouds...|$|R

40|$|Cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, {{is known}} as a {{quarantine}} pest that is hard to control with short periods of fumigation with phosphine (PH 3) or low concentrations of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate.</b> Moreover, low-temperature fumigation with <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> can lead to phototoxic damage of some perishable commodities. Therefore, a laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the synergistic effect of mixing <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> and PH 3 for the treatment of adults and nymphs of A. gossypii. Combined toxicity was observed and compared with a single dose of either <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> or PH 3. When insects were exposed to 0. 5 [*]g/m 3 of PH 3 combined with different levels of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> from 1. 6 to 16. 3 [*]g/m 3 at 5 and 20 °C for 2 [*]h, L(Ct) 50 and L(Ct) 99 values were greatly reduced in comparison with a single dose of either <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> or PH 3. The synergistic ratio (SR) is described as L(Ct) of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> alone/L(Ct) of ethyl formate[*]+[*]PH 3. The SR values of L(Ct) 50 and L(Ct) 99 for adult A. gossypii at 5 °C were 4. 55 and 2. 33, respectively. However, at 20 °C the SR levels of L(Ct) 50 and L(Ct) 99 were 2. 22 and 1. 45, respectively, but still showed significant synergism (significant difference, P[*]<[*] 0. 5). This new technology could meet quarantine and preshipment requirements for shorter exposure times and less damage of perishable commodities, and could also be extended for controlling other quarantine pests and thereby be a useful alternative to methyl bromide for fruit and vegetable applications...|$|E

Since the Montreal Protocol restricted use of methyl bromide as postharvest treatment, {{it was necessary}} to consider alternative safer fumigants for disinfestation of eucalyptus weevil. Laboratory experiments were conducted using concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 80 mg/liter of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate.</b> Complete control (100 % mortality) was achieved at 25 - 30 mg/liter of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> at 22 - 24 °C for 24 -h exposure without apples. However, with 90 - 95 % of the volume full of apples, complete control was achieved at 40 mg/liter of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> at 22 - 24 °C for 24 -h exposure.

40|$|Export of Pink Lady™ apples from Australia {{have been}} {{significantly}} affected by infestations of adult eucalyptus weevil (eucalyptus snout beetle or gum tree weevil). These weevils do not damage apple trees or fruit, but rest at the petiole portion of apples when selecting overwintering sites. As a result apples infested with live eucalyptus weevils leads to rejection for export. Usage of methyl bromide as post harvest treatment is restricted under the Montreal Protocol. Therefore, {{it has become}} important to develop an alternative safe fumigant as an eradication method for eucalyptus weevil on apple. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate,</b> which is a naturally occurring volatile chemical present in many plant commodities, as fumigant for eradication of the eucalyptus weevil on apples. Laboratory and cool storage trials show that <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> is highly toxic to the eucalyptus weevil and low phytotoxic to the fruit.

40|$|The {{detection}} of organic molecules with increasing complexity and potential biological relevance is opening {{the possibility to}} understand {{the formation of the}} building blocks of life in the interstellar medium. One of the families of molecules with astrobiological interest are the esters, whose simplest member, methyl formate, is rather abundant in star-forming regions. The next step in the chemical complexity of esters is <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate,</b> C_ 2 H_ 5 OCHO. Only two detections of this species have been reported so far, which strongly limits our understanding of how complex molecules are formed in the interstellar medium. We have searched for <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> towards the W 51 e 2 hot molecular core, one of the most chemically rich sources in the Galaxy {{and one of the most}} promising regions to study prebiotic chemistry, especially after the recent discovery of the P-O bond, key in the formation of DNA. We have analyzed a spectral line survey towards the W 51 e 2 hot molecular core, which covers 44 GHz in the 1, 2 and 3 mm bands, carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope. We report the {{detection of}} the trans and gauche conformers of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate.</b> A Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis indicates that the excitation temperature is 78 ± 10 K and that the two conformers have similar source-averaged column densities of (2. 0 ± 0. 3) × 10 ^ 16 cm^- 2 and an abundance of ∼ 10 ^- 8. We compare the observed molecular abundances of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> with different competing chemical models based on grain surface and gas-phase chemistry. We propose that grain-surface chemistry may have a dominant role in the formation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> (and other complex organic molecules) in hot molecular cores, rather than reactions in the gas phase.

40|$|Methyl bromide (MB) as a {{fumigant}} for Quarantine and Pre-shipment (QPS) {{could offer}} eradication of target pests within shorter fumigation period and without phytotoxicity. Therefore, unlike MB alternatives for soil fumigation, {{there is no}} ideally MB alternative fumigant for QPS purpose, particularly for perishable commodities. It is critically important that within shorter fumigation time requires killing all target insect pests and without effect of quality and deliver treated fruit and vegetables to the final consumer. Aphids are pests frequently found in imported and exported fruit and vegetables. Aphids was known as quarantine pest hard to control when conduct short period fumigation with phosphine (PH 3) and low dose of <b>ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> (EF). <b>Ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> can lead to highly sorption and phytotoxic damage of some perishable commodities such as strawberries and cut flowers, especially at lower temperature (< 8 °C).

The fungus was fumigated with Etf at various dose (0, 140, 190, 240, and 290 g m- 3) and at various exposure time (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours), in 5 L plastic bags. On in vivo test, agar plugs of C. gloeosporioides (diameter 0, 3 mm) were inoculated on to wounded strawberries, and the inoculated strawberries were then fumigated with Etf at similar dose and exposure time treatments. Each test was conducted in four replicates. Fumigation with Etf at 190 g m- 3 significantly reduced the growth of C. gloeosporioides on agar, but did not reduce the colonization of the pathogen on strawberries. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>formate</b> did not affect visual quality of strawberries, but damaged the calyx at 190 g m- 3.
