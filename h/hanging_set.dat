50|$|To {{quote from}} A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A {{catalogue}} of the British Museum collection - Although {{in the past the}} majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth <b>hangings,</b> <b>sets</b> of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from Tirupati that is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in Patanjali's Mahabhashya (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in Panini's grammar, the Ashtadhyayi (c. 5th century BC), Patanjali takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, yamapattaka, seem to have been particularly popular.|$|R

A deep study of the surfaces allows to verify that the blocks were worked on several occasions, with an extremely long interval, and that come from an undefined number of buildings of the town. Therefore, the handiwork represents an interesting abacus of workings, decorative elements, an exemplar of material culture with centuries of town history written on.|$|R

40|$|Described {{as one of}} {{the finest}} {{collections}} of stock scenery in the country, and a rare survival from the 19 th century, the painted scenery from Normansfield Theatre is the focus of this paper. A team of conservators from the Textile Conservation Centre, in collaboration with paintings conservators, conserved a representative selection of painted flats, a backdrop and a false proscenium for display on the stage as well as stabilising and storing the other items in a bespoke system so that they are accessible to researchers. Normansfield Theatre was a small private Victorian theatre and entertainment hall built in the grounds of a former hospital for people with learning difficulties. The theatre was used by the staff and patients for both therapeutic and recreational purposes between 1879 and 1909. The stage is a miniature version of a typical Georgian theatre, with grooves for scenic flats and mechanisms for <b>hanging</b> backdrops, <b>set</b> within a Victorian proscenium arch. Unusually over 100 pieces of stock scenery, created by established scene painters and dating from the 1870 s, survived in its original setting. Although textile conservators are familiar with treating painted textiles, the Normansfield scenery with its large flexible canvases and water soluble, under-bound paint presented new conservation challenges. Research into the scenery’s materials and construction, collaboration with paintings conservators and the conservation treatment itself were able to shed more light on the scene painter’s art...|$|R

50|$|For {{many years}} Paterson, New Jersey’s mostly Roman Catholic German {{immigrant}} community had gathered at Garret Rock, a large plateau {{at the summit}} of Garret Mountain in Passaic County, New Jersey near Paterson, in continuation of the ancient German spring festival of “Maying” or ascending a mountain to sing in the rising sun of the first Sunday of May. Fully 3,000 people were gathered upon the plateau by sunrise May Day, 1880. In progress to the festival, a group of the celebrants crossed upon the property of Mr. Dalzell, a local merchant, whereupon Dalzell’s son Robert ordered the inebriated, rowdy young trespassers off the property. A grappling then ensued between Robert and a locally popular 19-year-old newlywed, Joseph J. Van Houten, during which altercation the elder Dalzell shot Van Houten in the abdomen with a shotgun, killing him. On hearing the shotgun’s report, large portions of the celebrants then advanced down the mountain to find Van Houghton shot dead and, then, upon Dalzell and his son Robert, who retreated to the curtilage on the property, where they were arrested by a local constable, but the growing crowd, which was set upon the pair's lynching, thereafter, torched the barn. The elder Dalzell fired indiscriminately upon the crowd wounding a little boy and girl and, further, inciting the mob, whereupon the constable and his prisoners retreated from the blazing barn to the farm’s main house, which the crowd thereafter surrounded. After pelting {{the house for a}} time with rocks and bricks, the crowd, still intent upon smoking out the Dalzells and <b>hanging</b> them, also, <b>set</b> it aflame, and the constable and the Dalzells were obliged to again flee to a second house. Paterson’s mayor and sheriff arrived on the scene just as the main house was being put to the torch. By this time, some 10,000 enraged Paterson residents were milling about the countryside.|$|R
40|$|HeeremaMarine Contractors (HMC) {{owns and}} {{operates}} several semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCV) used for offshore heavy lift operations. Throughout the engineering phase of a (dual crane) heavy lift, dynamic lift models are generated by combining bodies with their hydrodynamic properties, inertia and spring-dashpot elements. The models represent the mass-spring system of a heavy lift over the different lift stages during a topside installation. These stages characterize the free floating, load transfer, free <b>hanging</b> and <b>set</b> down phases. Hook load fluctuations are governed by the relative vertical motion of the load and the crane boom tip. At the load transfer phase this motion is governed by both {{the motion of the}} vessel and the barge, whereas for the free hanging phase it is mostly effected by the motion of the vessel. To achieve safe and successful projects, an accurate prediction of the load and motion responses is essential while advising offshore personnel about the lift to perform. At the moment an inconsistency exists between predicted load fluctuations and offshore crane measurements. This is the main reason for this research. Until now a simplified spring-damper system is used to incorporate the hoist wire reeving system of a crane. This simplification is not fully justified and three goals are set up to model this in a more detailed manner. Firstly, the driving parameters of the load-crane-vessel system are assessed. Secondly the dynamic behavior of the wire reeving system is captured in a numerical model in Simulink. Finally, the dynamic load fluctuations of the model are compared with offshore measurements to both validate the model and analyze the results. The dynamical model of the load-crane-vessel system is solved in the time domain and it consists of two parts. The first part considers the sheave and wire system of the crane. An equation of motion is derived for each sheave where dry friction is taken into account and leads to a stick-slip effect. This friction originates from the sheave bearings and from the bending friction of the steel wire rope that runs over it. When a load is raised, the stress in each rope part increases from the winch to the dead end. With a lowering operation the effect is the opposite. Due to stick-slip this force difference remains in the crane wires after the operation. The friction factors of the sheaves in the numerical model are tuned with steps observed in offshore load measurements during crane operations. The second part of the model imposes the measured vessel motions to calculate the motion of both crane boom tips and the topside. This is performed by applying their influences as external forces on the free bodies. With the relativemotion the response of the hoist wire forces is determined. A coupling of these two parts can be made by removing the element of the hoist wire in the imposed motion model and replacing it by a pair of two nonlinear forces determined fromthe sheave wire model. These forces have an opposite sign and are equal in absolutemagnitude and phase. The effect of friction on dynamic hook load fluctuations is also consideredwith inputs of different amplitudes and frequencies. The hook load fluctuations at the measuring sheave are lower than applied fluctuations in the model when friction is taken into account. The simulated force at the measuring sheave is better represented with higher load fluctuations as the stick condition is exceeded earlier. Offshore and Dredging Engineerin...|$|R
