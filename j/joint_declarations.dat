Among other things, the full application of the treaty would have led to the expansion of the Democratic Republic of Armenia to include regions such as Bitlis, Van, Erzurum and Trabzon while granting local autonomy to the Kurdish inhabited areas east of the Euphrates river and to the south of Armenia. Sharif Pasha, the Kurdish representative in the Paris Peace Conference, reached an agreement with the Armenian representatives on December 20, 1919, and both parties made <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> to the conference.|$|E

5000|$|After {{rounds of}} negotiations, the Sino-British <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> was finally {{initialled}} {{by representatives of}} both Britain and China on 26 September 1984, and on 19 December, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> was formally signed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang in the Great Hall of the People. As {{one of the main}} draftsmen of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration,</b> Cradock also witnessed the signing in person. However, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> could not bring confidence to the people of Hong Kong. According to an opinion poll conducted shortly afterwards, only 16% of the respondents felt reassured by it, while 76% of the respondents held a reserved attitude. Furthermore, 30% believed that [...] "One Country Two Systems" [...] suggested in the <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> would be unworkable, showing that the general public of Hong Kong felt insecure and doubtful about the agreement made between Britain and China.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> on the Question of Macau, or Sino-Portuguese <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration,</b> was {{a treaty}} between Portugal and the People's Republic of China over {{the status of}} Macau. The full name of the treaty is <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the {{question}} of Macao. Signed in March, 1987 the Declaration established the process and conditions of the transfer of the territory from Portuguese rule to the People's Republic of China. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Declaration</b> served also as the main source of fundamental rights that were implemented in the Macau Special Administrtaive Region Basic Law. The process was similar to the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty by the United Kingdom in 1997.|$|R

50|$|In 1946 the Council of People's Commissars was {{transformed}} into the Council of Ministers, with People's Commissariats turned into Ministries. The council issued declarations and instructions based on and in accordance with applicable laws, which had obligatory jurisdictional power over the territories of all republics within the Union. However, the most important state issues were handled through <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union (CPSU), which was de facto {{more powerful than the}} Council of Ministers. In 1991 the Council of Ministers was dissolved, and replaced by the newly established Cabinet of Ministers, which itself disappeared only months later when the Soviet Union disintegrated.|$|E

The Anglo-Argentine CBMs are contained in a series of <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> signed in 1989, 1990 and 1991, and include classic CBMs such as the establishment of direct communication links, exchanges of information, search and rescue procedures, notification of military movements and maneuvers above certain specified levels, and the establishment of certain [...] "rules of behavior".|$|E
5000|$|At present, {{there are}} two SARs {{established}} according to the Constitution, namely the Hong Kong SAR and the Macau SAR, former British and Portuguese dependencies respectively, transferred to China in 1997 and 1999 pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration of 1987 respectively. Pursuant to their <b>Joint</b> <b>Declarations,</b> which are binding inter-state treaties registered with the United Nations, and their Basic laws, the Chinese SARs [...] "shall enjoy {{a high degree of}} autonomy." [...] There is additionally the Wolong Special Administrative Region in Sichuan province, which is however not established according to Article 31 of the Constitution. Generally, the two SARs are not considered to constitute a part of Mainland China, by both Chinese and SAR authorities.|$|E

[...] No permanent office or staff belongs to the conference itself. [...] The conference was attended by as many as 1,200 people until 1994, but was scaled back in size in subsequent years to somewhat over 100 people, in order to permit the governors better opportunities for personal interaction and substantive discussions. [...] Its importance is still uncertain, however, as it is sometimes seen as more about publicity and conversation than accomplishing tangible results.|$|E

5000|$|First {{visit by}} Estonian {{government}} happened in 1996 when Siim Kallas, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia visited Azerbaijan and <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> were signed. In 2000, the Azerbaijan-Estonian inter-parliamentary working group {{was established in}} National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Estonia supported Azerbaijan in joining the Council of Europe and supports Azerbaijan's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves {{paid a visit to}} Azerbaijan in 2009 and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev visited Estonia in 2010. Estonia supports the resolution of the issues related to the Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent areas through negotiations. Former Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kristina Ojuland have stated that Nagorno-Karabakh is an [...] "inseparable" [...] of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is considering to cancel visa regime with Estonia. Estonia also interests in development of cooperation with Azerbaijan within NATO's peacekeeping missions. Azerbaijan is interested in developing the high-level political dialogue. Even though not many defence related co-operation projects have taken place between two nations, defense and military-related contacts have been described as [...] "good and open-minded".|$|E
5000|$|Nonetheless, Beneš did {{not refuse}} Sikorski's {{proposal}} outright, as the federation proposal {{was supported by}} the UK and later by the US, which also supported the plans for other federations such as the Greek-Yugoslav confederation. He was afraid that open refusal would lead to the Poles opening negotiations with the Czechoslovak opposition or to his government being marginalized by the British Foreign Office. Beneš decided to continue the negotiations with the Poles over the possibility of federation but with little haste; in fact, many of the Czechoslovak government's moves were designed to prolong the negotiations without any real commitment. The negotiations proceeded slowly, with numerous conferences, and with <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> on 11 November 1940 (a declaration by the two governments about entering [...] "a closer political and economic association"), on 23 January 1942 (in which both governments agreed to form a confederation after the war and mentioned common policies on diplomacy, defense, trade, education and communication) and on 10 June 1942. January 1941 saw the establishment of the Czechoslovak-Polish Coordinating Committee to oversee the process of the negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|The slogan [...] "Together on {{the road}} to knowledge" [...] was the motto of the German-Chinese Year of Science and Education 2009/10, which took place from March 2009 to June 2010. German and Chinese players in science, education, {{politics}} and society came together at more than 200 events, workshops and delegation visits, which included the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting with young Chinese research talent in attendance, and the BMBF's participation in events jointly organized by Germany and China in Shenyang and Wuhan on the topic of [...] "sustainable urban development" [...] during the campaign “Germany and China - Moving Ahead Together" [...] (DuC), which attracted more than 300,000 visitors each. In addition, students and scientists gathered information on further activities of the Science Year, about German education and research institutions and research funding opportunities. In Germany the first ever “China Weeks” were held at 47 German universities to provide information about the partner country to the public and {{to draw attention to the}} potential of German-Chinese cooperation in higher education and research. A film contest was also launched during the Science Year. The BMBF provided funding worth some two million euros to German research projects with a focus on China. Key areas of the cooperation included cutting-edge research on climate, energy and health issues, as well as activities in the areas of vocational training and higher education. The first and second German-Chinese intergovernmental consultations (2011: Berlin; 2012: Beijing) raised cooperation between the two countries to a new level. In total, seven <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> on education and research topics were signed during the intergovernmental consultations. The range of topics in the cooperation between the BMBF and China in the higher education sector (students, graduate students, scientist exchanges, universities) and in vocational education and training was addressed in joint activities in various research disciplines such as innovation research, life sciences, environment/ecology, LED technologies, geosciences, marine research or cultural heritage.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{relations}} between the Russian Federation and China have intensified both at the political and economic level, based on a strategic partnership. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the depth of the present Sino-Russian relations, especially in the area of economic cooperation in order to identify the problems and prospects of this strategic partnership. Our analysis finds that the “Eastern pivot” of the Russian Federation has more political substance than an economic one. Moreover, the commercial and investment goals agreed upon in their <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> are difficult to achieve, especially in the context of the Chinese economic reform and the Russian Federation’s economic downturn. Despite positive statements by their leaders,the Russian Federation and China are still trying to compromise on solutions for a range of economic and political issues that hinder bilateral cooperation. ...|$|E

40|$|During the Eisenhower {{administration}} (1953 - 1961), voluntary export restraints (VERs) reemerged as a {{major element}} of United States trade policy. Administration policies established and refined their use as instruments to control imports from countries with low wage and production costs. Initially, this was almost exclusively Japan. By the 1970 s, however, VERs were institutionalized as a significant element of American international trade policy and they encompassed {{a wide range of}} manufactured products and exporting countries. They remained a major characteristic of United States trade with Japan. VERs are actions by foreign producers, often in conjunction with their governments, to limit exports to certain international markets. They sometimes take the form of unilateral declarations by exporters designed to reduce the possibility of restrictive action by importing countries. Often VERs are <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> by exporting and importing countries negotiated as part of bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings to control imports...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that the G- 7 summit makes few sub-stantive decisions and lacks effective monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms to enforce individual countries ' commitments. However, evidence exists that G- 7 countries do honor their commitments announced in summit declarations. In this article, I offer and test for the period from 1975 to 1989 several causal explanations for compli-ance with non-binding commitments dealing with inflation control: institutional constraints on monetary and fiscal policymaking, electoral politics, uncertainty, and reciprocity Reciprocating behaviors, inde-pendent central banks, and high current inflation rates correlate posi-tively with compliance over inflation-control commitments. In addi-tion, {{there is some evidence}} that divided/coalition governments and uncertainty reduce compliance. Theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed. Starting in 1975, the G- 7 Countries ' have engaged each other in macroeco-nomic policy coordination at an annual summit. According to conventional wisdom, the G- 7 summit serves merely as a photo opportunity for politicians. The institution is considered unimportant and ineffective in setting and achiev-ing targets because country commitments, embodied in <b>joint</b> <b>declarations,</b> ar...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{polarizing}} issue {{in which there are}} significant differences in perception between the scientific community and the general public. The intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has formally acknowledged an increasing body of evidence that supports primarily human-caused climate change. No scientific organization has dissented, and over thirty national academies of the sciences have issued <b>joint</b> <b>declarations</b> confirming the evidence of anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, polarization is not caused by a lack of available scientific information. This study surveys Utah State University faculty to solicit their knowledge of and attitudes towards global climate change. Responses are assessed against the current consensus as articulated in the IPCC 2 ̆ 7 s Fourth Assessment Report. Statistical analyses are performed to examine any relationships between perceptions and variables such as information sources, personal issue importance, gender, college, political identity, and religious affiliation. Respondents whose perceptions differ significantly from the scientific community are analyzed and found to mirror national trends.
