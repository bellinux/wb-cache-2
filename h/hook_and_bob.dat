One more album, All the Good That's Happening, was released before the band broke up in 1967 when Pons left {{to join the}} pop group The Turtles; In the early 1970s, Pons played bass with Frank Zappa. Arlin went on to form heavy psychedelic band The <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> The Robert Savage Group. The band reunited in 1970 before Pons {{became a member of}} Zappa's band. The reunited lineup included Jim Pons on rhythm guitar, John Beck on lead guitar, Buddy Sklar, lead singer from The <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> The Spencer Davis Group, Al Nichols on bass from the Turtles, <b>and</b> <b>Bob</b> [...] "Bullet" [...] Bailey on drums. The band did some touring and performed at local Los Angeles based nightclubs before disbanding in 1971.|$|R
50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of the <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. Shrinking the hooks led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing {{the size of the}} hooks, the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more hooks for the same strength. The other difference is that <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop has indeterminate match-up between the <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. With larger <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners, each hook has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop fasteners, matching up each of these hooks with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

40|$|An {{allegation}} {{of sexual assault}} was made in which a bra was torn off by the assailant causing extensive damage; however, {{it was observed that}} the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fastening was still intact. It was felt that it was not possible for a garment to receive such damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fastening, thus indicating that the complainant caused the damage to the bra herself to support a false allegation. Reconstruction experiments were conducted in which the conditions of the allegation were simulated utilizing a range of similar bras. Following the infliction of damage, the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fastenings were examined. In eight of nine experiments, the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fastening were intact, despite the application of enough force to cause separation of the bra cups in five of the experiments. This shows that bras may suffer extensive damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fastening...|$|R

50|$|Various constructions and {{strengths}} are available. Some touch fasteners {{are strong enough}} that a two-inch square (5 × 5 cm) piece is enough to support a 175 lb load. Fasteners made of Teflon loops, polyester <b>hooks,</b> <b>and</b> glass backing are used in aerospace applications, e.g. on space shuttles. The strength of the bond depends on how well the hooks are embedded in the loops, how much surface area is {{in contact with the}} <b>hooks,</b> <b>and</b> the nature of the force pulling it apart. If <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop is used to bond two rigid surfaces, such as auto body panels and frame, the bond is particularly strong because any force pulling the pieces apart is spread evenly across all hooks. Also, any force pushing the pieces together is disproportionately applied to engaging more <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> loops. Vibration can cause rigid pieces to improve their bond. Full-body <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> loop suits have been made that can hold a person to a suitably covered wall.|$|R

40|$|The base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> {{system is}} an {{attachment}} {{that is designed}} to be used on the lunar surface as an improved alternative to the common crane <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye system. The design proposed uses an omni-directional ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base to overcome the design problems associated with a conventional crane <b>hook.</b> The base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> is not sensitive to cable twist which would render a robotic lunar crane useless since there is little atmospheric resistance to dampen the motion of an oscillating member. The symmetric characteristics of the ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base eliminates manual placement of the ball hook into the base; commonly associated with the typical <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye stem. The major advantage of the base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> system is it's ease of couple and uncouple modes that are advantages during unmanned robotic lunar missions...|$|R
