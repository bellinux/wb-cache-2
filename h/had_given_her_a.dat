5|$|Alfie Karmal, {{the son of}} a Palestinian {{father and}} Greek mother, was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for {{cosmetic}} surgery to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> modelling contract, but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills-only German sex education manual called Die Freuden der Liebe (The Joys of Love).|$|E
5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Shaftesbury and {{his third}} wife had {{separated}} in April 2004 and divorce proceedings had been set in motion. By that time, he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> windmill in the Gers region of southwestern France, the €700,000 duplex in a villa in Cannes, which included staff, a 4x4 car, and a monthly allowance, ranging between €7,500 and €10,000. Shaftesbury wanted to end this arrangement and the marriage, {{so that he could}} marry his new girlfriend. While Shaftesbury was discussing his desire with his wife, a fight broke out between him and his wife's brother, Mohammed M'Barek. Lord Shaftesbury died during the fight, when Mohammed strangled him, breaking his neck.|$|E

25|$|Fisher wrote {{a letter}} of {{recommendation}} to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., resulting in Thomas' being hired for the Ziegfeld Follies. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she walked right up and asked for the job. She made her stage debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1915 on June 21, 1915. Thomas' popularity in the Follies led to her being cast in Ziegfeld's more risqué Midnight Frolic show. The Frolic was staged after hours in the roof garden of the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had plenty of money to bestow on the young and beautiful female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that German Ambassador Albrecht von Bernstorff <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> $10,000 string of pearls.|$|E
25|$|When Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in 1933, Meitner was still acting as head of the physics {{department}} of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. Although she was protected by her Austrian citizenship, all other Jewish scientists, including Szilárd, Fritz Haber, her nephew Otto Frisch, and many other eminent figures, were dismissed or forced to resign from their posts. Most of them emigrated from Germany. Her response was to say nothing and bury herself in her work. After the Anschluss in March 1938, her situation became difficult. On July 13, 1938, Meitner, with the support of Otto Hahn and the help from the Dutch physicists Dirk Coster and Adriaan Fokker, departed for the Netherlands. She was forced to travel under cover to the Dutch border, where Coster persuaded German immigration officers that she had permission to travel to the Netherlands. She reached safety, though without her possessions. Meitner later said that she left Germany forever with 10 marks in her purse. Before she left, Otto Hahn <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> diamond ring he had inherited from his mother: this was to be used to bribe the frontier guards if required. It was not required, and Meitner's nephew's wife later wore it.|$|E

He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a cup of tea and asked her for what he described as a [...] "Christmas kiss". He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was [...] "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.|$|E
500|$|By {{the last}} chorus, a {{close-up}} of Koda's eyes closes and zooms out, showing Koda in lighter clothes and long hair. A long field of dark green grass with the sun and blue sky beaming above it, still showing the abandoned city and merry-go-round in the distance. The field is then shown to be the distance of a cliff, with Koda standing on the edge and observing a forest at the bottom; these scenes are shot in colour instead of black and white. The final vocal interlude break of the song has inter cut scenes of Koda on the cliff, and Koda walking through the valley from earlier scenes. The final scene has a repeating scene of the first scene; Koda walking through the valley in the distance of a wasteland. After completing the video and watching it, Koda commented that the overall appearance <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> [...] "personal connection" [...] to the video and song. She stated that the visual effects were [...] "very cool", and declared {{it as one of}} her [...] "best" [...] videos.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, Saldívar went to {{her lawyer}} and wrote her resignation, which Quintanilla, Jr. {{believed}} was her alibi. The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Selena was in Miami, Florida, at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed {{this would have been}} the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting. Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico. According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until she could find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to [...] "get rid of it" [...] and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez. This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> [...]22-caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Miloš Forman's {{first feature}} film Cerný Petr (Black Peter) was {{released}} in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year's Locarno Film Festival, where it won the top prize, thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia's communist bureaucracy and {{making it possible for}} Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom. Unsure of what the next project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase. [...] He gave her a lift and learned her story: [...] she had come to the big city from Varnsdorf, where she had been seduced by a young engineer, who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life. [...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for {{much of the rest of}} the night, before putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase. In Forman's words: [...] "I guess I'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1998, she {{enrolled}} in both a professional wrestling school and Canisius College in Buffalo, New York. Her first choice for wrestling school was Stu Hart's Dungeon, but because of the location, she decided on a more local school. At the school, she was trained by the All Knighters (Joey Knight and Robin Knightwing), who themselves had trained in the Hart Dungeon. She later stated that Nora Greenwald, who was known in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Molly Holly, had paid for her to attend wrestling school after Carolan <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> demo tape of her work. Her professional wrestling debut match was against Alexis Laree. She then worked for various independent promotions, including Cleveland All Pro Wrestling and Apocalypse Wrestling, against both male and female wrestlers, using the name [...] "Phoenix". In 2002, {{she was one of the}} first wrestlers in GLORY, an independent organization for women, and was the inaugural champion. She then joined Far North Wrestling (FNW), and was the only female wrestler in the promotion. She defeated Joey Knight and Kevin Grace in 2003 to become the FNW Cruiserweight Champion. Later in 2003 she took part in World Xtreme Wrestling's annual Women's Elite 8 tournament where she made it to the final, before losing to April Hunter. She returned two years later and defeated Nikki Roxx, but was bested in the second round by eventual winner Alicia. The following month, Phoenix appeared at the inaugural taping for the Ring of Honor sister promotion Shimmer Women Athletes; during Volume 1 she was pinned by Shimmer founder Allison Danger but scored an upset victory in a non-title match against NWA Midwest Women's Champion MsChif.|$|E
