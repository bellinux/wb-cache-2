In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo grounded out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> and Roy Campanella grounded out.

After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting Murry Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers {{were looking to}} use either Higbe, who had pitched in the previous game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter ground out. Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a fly out ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of the second inning.|$|E
5|$|The top of {{the seventh}} started with Furillo flying out to right field. Reese, Edwards, and Schultz all singled after Furillo's out. Reese scored on Schultz's hit, but Slaughter threw Edwards out at third base A groundout by Bob Ramazzotti ended the threat with the Cardinals leading, 3–2. Dyer later said he {{considered}} this play the one that saved the game for St. Louis. In {{the bottom of the}} seventh, the Dodgers insterted their fourth pitcher, Vic Lombardi. After Musial tripled and Slaughter <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> he was replaced by Rube Melton, the fifth and final pitcher the Dodgers used. A Garagiola single scored Musial, and Melton got the other two outs in between a wild pitch, making the score 4–2 {{at the end of the}} seventh. Stanky walked to start the eighth, giving him a league-leading 137 walks for the season. Brooklyn finished the eighth inning leaving two on base, and the Cardinals failed to score in the bottom of the eighth as well, leaving a man on base. In the {{top of the}} ninth, Reese and Edwards <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> and Schultz struck out to end the game, giving the Cardinals a 4–2 victory.|$|E

50|$|Any of {{the above}} types of balls might be fair balls or foul balls. Umpires will also signal first signal fair or foul on <b>fly</b> <b>outs</b> near the foul line, but {{the result of a}} foul <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> (or foul out) is no {{different}} from a fair fly out; it is not a foul ball.|$|R
5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters. Eddie Stanky grounded out, Cookie Lavagetto <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to center field, and Joe Medwick grounded out to end the inning. Branca took the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first, striking out Red Schoendienst and allowing a single to Terry Moore. After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals back up, and the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on the first pitch he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> then Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was taken out of the game.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|Tim Wakefield {{made his}} first start of the 2004 postseason for the Red Sox, {{becoming}} the first knuckleball pitcher to make a World Series start since 1948, while Woody Williams, who had won both his previous two starts in the post-season, was the Cardinals' starting pitcher. In {{the bottom of the}} first inning, Williams gave up a lead-off double to Johnny Damon, and then hit Orlando Cabrera in the shoulder with one of his pitches. After Manny Ramírez <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> Ortiz hit a three-run home run in his first-ever World Series at bat. Kevin Millar then scored by virtue of a single by Bill Mueller to put the Red Sox up 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{faced the}} Atlanta Braves in the 1996 National League Championship Series. Smith started Game 1 and {{subsequently}} registered three putouts and one {{assist in the}} field, but went hitless in four at-bats in the Cardinals' 4–2 loss. The Cardinals then won Games 2, 3, and 4, contests in which Smith did not appear. Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and zero hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat. The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season. When the Cardinals were trailing by ten runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking {{the end of his}} playing career. Smith finished his career with distinctions ranging from the accumulation of more than 27.5 million votes in All-Star balloting, to holding the record for the most MLB at-bats without hitting a grand slam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E

25|$|Aurelio López pitched 2-1/3 {{innings of}} relief without putting a runner on {{base for the}} win. Despite {{allowing}} a rare run {{in the top of}} the 8th inning, Willie Hernández got the save as Tony Gwynn <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to Larry Herndon to end the game, sending Detroit into a wild victory celebration.|$|E
25|$|In the sixth, Cockrell {{reached with}} one out on an error by Joseph. Stephens doubled, driving in Cockrell. Briggs {{grounded}} out to Allen, advancing Stephens to third, and then Stephens scored when Warfield beat out a hit to Joseph at third, widening Hilldale's lead to 4–0. In {{the top of the}} seventh, Allen led off with a single to right. McNair sacrificed, and after Moore <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> Allen stole third. Joseph was hit by a pitch, and Hawkins beat out a slow roller to Judy Johnson at third, scoring Allen, and making the score, 4–1.|$|E
25|$|The Hilldale Club {{was first}} to score {{in the bottom of}} the fourth, when Thomas hit a two-out double to center. George Johnson drove him in with a single to left. In the fifth, Warfield reached base with one out on an error by Moore. Carr walked, and Mackey doubled off the right field wall, driving in Warfield. Judy Johnson {{grounded}} to Bell, and Carr was thrown out trying to get back to third after attempting to score on the play. Thomas <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning, and Hilldale was up, 2–0.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} ways batters or runners are put out are by strikeouts, <b>fly</b> <b>outs,</b> tag outs, and force outs; however, there are many, {{somewhat}} rarer, ways an out can occur.|$|R

25|$|Schiraldi {{returned}} to the mound for the Red Sox {{trying to keep the}} score even and atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get Knight, putting the winning run in scoring position with nobody out. This time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as Howard Johnson, pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings.|$|E
25|$|Chris Duncan misplayed another {{ball in the}} top of {{the sixth}} for a Sean Casey two-out double, but this time the runner would be {{stranded}} as Iván Rodríguez then struck out to end the inning. A David Eckstein single followed by a Preston Wilson walk in the bottom of the seventh put runners at first and second with none out for the heart of the Cardinals order: Pujols, Edmonds, and Rolen. Pujols popped out and Edmonds <b>flied</b> <b>out,</b> so it appeared Detroit might hold the Cardinals to a one-run lead. Instead, Scott Rolen singled and scored Eckstein, doubling the Cardinals lead to 4–2.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals won both games {{they played}} {{to end the}} regular season in October, earning a win in a three-game series and sealing the season series against the {{division}} rival Miami Marlins. Second baseman Daniel Murphy was in a narrow race with the Colorado Rockies' DJ LeMahieu for the batting title until {{the last day of}} the season, but with Murphy injured and LeMahieu not playing in order to preserve his small edge, the race came down to a pinch-hit opportunity for Murphy against Miami on October 2, in which the National <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to right to finish a little more than a point below LeMahieu.|$|E

25|$|Whatever the {{reasoning}} behind the decision was, McNamara called upon his closer Schiraldi {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. Lee Mazzilli, pinch hitting for Jesse Orosco, who recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. Wally Backman followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, Darryl Strawberry stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run. Instead, Strawberry <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning.|$|E
25|$|The {{same was}} not true of the wild-card leading Atlanta Braves. 10 games ahead of the Cardinals on August 24, Atlanta went only 6–7 over its next 13 games before coming to St. Louis on September 9 to play a three-game series that {{would prove to be}} critical. In the first game, Atlanta led 3–1 going {{into the bottom of the}} ninth inning, but a Schumaker single and walks to Furcal and Theriot set up a two-run, two-out Albert Pujols single to tie the game. The Cardinals won on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Nick Punto in the bottom of the 10th. On September 10 St. Louis won by the same 4–3 score when Michael Bourn <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to right with the tying run on third. On the 11th Yadier Molina hit a three-run double and the Cardinals won 6–3 to complete the sweep. The sweep cut the gap in the wild-card race to 4 games, but St. Louis had only 16 games left to play and its playoff chances were still only 7.7%.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Nationals {{selected}} the contract of top overall prospect Víctor Robles. They cleared {{space for the}} 20-year-old outfielder on the 40-man roster by moving Fedde to the 60-day disabled list. Outfielders Rafael Bautista and Andrew Stevenson were also recalled. Manager Dusty Baker disclosed that outfielder Brian Goodwin had experienced a setback while rehabbing from a groin injury suffered the previous month, rendering his status doubtful {{for the rest of}} the season. Robles pinch-hit and <b>flied</b> <b>out</b> to deep right field in his major league debut as the Nationals took the first of four from the division rival Philadelphia Phillies, coming back to win 4−3. The Nationals made one more call-up on September 8, recalling infielder Adrián Sánchez in what Baker said was the last of the team's scheduled call-ups with expanded September rosters. In that evening's game against the Phillies, the Nationals won behind big offensive games from their shortstop Turner and their center fielder Michael A. Taylor, who respectively were a triple and a double shy of hitting for the cycle. Taylor hit the first major league inside-the-park grand slam in nearly two years, and the first in team history, as the Nationals defeated the Phillies in the dramatic 11−10 game. The Nationals took three out of four from the Phillies in the series, with Baker deploying a rookie-heavy team for the series finale on September 10 and Strasburg extending his scoreless inning streak to 34 innings, the longest of any major league pitcher in the season, as he earned the win in the 3−2 contest. Robles collected his first major league hit and RBI, driving in Sánchez with a double but being called out at third after he slid past the bag in an attempt to stretch the hit into a triple. With the Marlins losing to the Atlanta Braves the same day, the Nationals became the first team in the 2017 Major League Baseball season to clinch a spot in the playoffs and a division title, winning the National League East crown for the fourth time since their 2012 season.|$|E
