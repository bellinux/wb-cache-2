5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the 7th Division {{arrived in}} France, forming {{the basis of}} the British III Corps; the cavalry <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> its own corps of three divisions. By December 1914, the BEF had expanded, fielding five army corps divided between the First and the Second Armies. As the Regular Army's {{strength}} declined, the numbers were made up— first by the Territorial Force, then by the volunteers of Field Marshal Kitchener's New Army. By the end of August 1914, he had raised six new divisions; by March 1915, the number of divisions had increased to 29. The Territorial Force was also expanded, raising second and third battalions and forming eight new divisions, which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions. The Third Army was formed in July 1915 and with the influx of troops from Kitchener's volunteers and further reorganisation, the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army, which became the Fifth Army were formed in 1916.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The Molossian {{kingdom of}} Epirus {{had been an}} {{important}} subject ally of Macedon since 350 BC, when Philip had taken the son of king Arybbas, Alexander hostage. During this time at court, Alexander (brother of Philip's wife Olympias), <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> an admirer of Philip, and Philip therefore decided to replace Arybbas with Alexander. The exact date this occurred is unclear; Cawkwell suggests this happened in early 342 BC, when Alexander would have been 20, {{as a prelude to}} his Thracian campaign. Arybbas went into exile in Athens, where he was promised help to regain his kingdom; however, Alexander would remain on the throne (and loyal to Philip) until his death in 334 BC. Philip certainly campaigned against the Epirote Cassopaeans in early 342 BC, taking control of three cities to secure the southern regions of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter {{to hold a}} market at his castle, and followed this {{with the creation of}} a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate, around the site that became the Bull Ring. This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau {{at a time when the}} area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land. Within a century of the charter Birmingham <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen. By 1327 it was the third-largest town in Warwickshire, a position it would retain for the next 200 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1859 {{a company}} had been formed to link the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway with the SD via the Derwent Valley; by 1860 this <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>into</b> the Newcastle, Derwent & Weardale Railway, which now {{bypassed}} the SD and linked with the SD, and the North British and London & North Western (LNWR) railways were providing {{two thirds of the}} capital. The LNWR proposed to build warehouses in Hartlepool and buy shares in the West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway. The North Eastern Railway (NER), formed in 1854 by amalgamation, at the time was the largest railway company in the country and controlled the East Coast Main Line from Knottingley, south of York, through Darlington to Berwick-upon-Tweed. When they approached the S with a proposal to merge, the directors deciding they preferred a merger with the NER than eventually becoming part of the LNWR, entered negotiations. Opposed by the NER, the Newcastle, Derwent & Weardale Railway bill was approved by the House of Commons in 1861, but the line was eventually rejected by the House of Lords. The SD and EVR were absorbed by the S on 30 June 1862.|$|E
