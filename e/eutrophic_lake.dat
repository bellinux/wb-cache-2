40|$|The stable carbon (C) isotope {{variability}} of dissolved inorganic and organic C (DIC and DOC), {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC), glucose and polar-lipid derived fatty acids (PLFAs) was studied {{in a survey of}} 22 North American oligotrophic to <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> The d 13 C of different PLFAs were used as proxy for phytoplankton producers and bacterial consumers. Lake pCO 2 was primarily determined by autochthonous production (phytoplankton biomass), especially in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> and governed the d 13 C of DIC. All organic-carbon pools showed overall higher isotopic variability in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> (n = 11) compared to oligo-mesotrophic lakes (n = 11) because of the high variability in d 13 C {{at the base of the}} food web (both autochthonous and allochthonous carbon). Phytoplankton d 13 C was negatively related to lake pCO 2 over all lakes and positively related to phytoplankton biomass in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> which was also reflected in a large range in photosynthetic isotope fractionation (?CO 2 -phyto, 8 – 25 ‰).

40|$|Published data on mean annual epilimnetic total N (TN) and P (TP) were {{analyzed}} to find how TN: TP varies with lake trophic status. TN: TP {{is high in}} oligotrophic lakes and very low in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> declining in a curvilinear fashion with increased TP. Comparison of this trend with published N: P in lake nutrient sources suggests that TN: TP reflects the source of nutrients: the ratio is high in oligotrophic lakes because they receive their N and P from natural, undisturbed watersheds which export much less P than N; mesotrophic and <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> receive various mixtures of nutrient sources that have lower average N: P, and very <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> have N: P that correspond very nearly to the N: P of sewage. Two inflection points were identified in the TN: TP relationship (- 20 and- 100 wg TP liter-l) the first probably reflecting the large difference between TN: TP in nutrient export from undisturbed terrestrial ecosystems and that of meso- and eutrophic sources such as urban and pasture land runoff and sewage, and the second probably reflecting increased rates of denitrification in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Analysis of published manipulation experiments shows that N limitation is not only significantly more frequent in lakes of low ambient TN: TP (TN: TP mass ratio 5 14) but is also significantly more frequent in lakes with TP> 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In 2 small unpolluted {{streams in}} eastern Hesse (Fed.

40|$|The oxygen-consuming {{processes}} in the hypolimnia of freshwater lakes leading to deep-water anoxia are still not well understood, thereby constraining suitable management concepts. This study presents data obtained from 11 <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> and suggests a model describing the consumption of dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the hypolimnia of <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> {{as a result of}} only two fundamental processes: O 2 is consumed (i) by settled organic material at the sediment surface and (ii) by reduced substances diffusing from the sediment. Apart from a lake’s productivity, its benthic O 2 consumption depends on the O 2 concentration in the water overlying the sediment and the molecular O 2 diffusion to the sediment. On the basis of observational evidence of long-term monitoring data from 11 <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> we found that the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate ranging from 0. 47 to 1. 31 g of O 2 m– 2 d– 1 (average 0. 90 ± 0. 30) is a function of (i) a benthic flux of reduced substances (0. 37 ± 0. 12 g of O 2 m– 2 d– 1) and (ii) an O 2 consumption which linearly increases with the mean hypolimnion thickness (zH) up to 25 m.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of eutrophication on arsenic speciation in lake waters was investigated. Surface water samples (n = 1 - 10) were collected from 18 lakes in Japan during July 2007 and February 2008. The lakes were classified into mesotrophic (7 <b>lakes)</b> and <b>eutrophic</b> (11 <b>lakes)</b> based on the total phosphate (T-P) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in water column. Inorganic, methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic species were determined by combining hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry with ultraviolet irradiation. Organoarsenicals (mainly methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions) comprised 30 - 60 % of the total arsenic in most lakes during summer. On the other hand, inorganic arsenic species (As(III + V)) dominates (about 60 - 85 %) during winter. The occurrence of ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic was higher in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> than those in mesotrophic lakes in both seasons. The concentration of dimethyl arsenic (DMAA) was high in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> during winter; and in mesotrophic lakes during summer. The {{results suggest that the}} conversion of As(III + V) to more complicated organoarsenicals occurred frequently in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> compared to that in mesotrophic lakes, which is thought to be {{the influence}} of biological activity in the water column. The distribution of arsenic species were well correlated with phosphate concentrations than those of Chl-a. This might be due to the competitive uptake of As(V) and phosphate by phytoplankton. The organoarsenicals (OrgAs) /As(V) ratio was higher at low phosphate concentration indicating that conversion of As(V) to OrgAs species was more active in phosphate-exhausted lakes with high phytoplankton density. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Intact {{sediment}} cores {{were taken}} from the deepest basins of 9 lakes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, to investigate the factors controlling silicon (Si) concentrations in sediment pore waters and the flux of Si to the overlying lake water. The lakes ranged in trophic state from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic. A Si vertical flux model simulated Si gradients in the pore water with high precision (r 2 > 0. 95, p < 0. 01) in lakes with no volcanic tephra layers or significant geothermal inflows. The ubiquitous presence of diatom frustules in the sediment was likely responsible for release of Si to the pore waters and subsequent diffusion to overlying lake waters. Fluxes of Si were related to the trophic status of the lake and were greatest in <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> where diatom populations reduced epilimnetic Si concentrations to < 1 mg L- 1. Temporal variations in the concentrations of Si, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) suggest that over most of the year diatom growth in the oligotrophic lakes is limited by N, or co-limited by N and P. In some <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> Si may limit diatom growth during homothermal conditions, and P and/or N may limit growth when the lake is stratified. The reduction of surface Si concentrations to < 0. 1 mg L- 1 following homothermy in some <b>eutrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> is likely to restrict the growth of diatoms, potentially resulting in increased dominance of nonsiliceous flagellated species and cyanobacteria...|$|R

Remote sensing techniques have shown potential for monitoring water quality in shallow inland lakes, especially in data-scarce areas. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd(λ)) of the water column, in order to map the euphotic depth (Zeu) of Lake Naivasha, Kenya using the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Intensive in situ radiometric and limnological data collection was undertaken at Lake Naivasha. Atmospheric correction was done on the MERIS images using MERIS Neural Network algorithms, Case 2 Waters (C 2 R) and <b>Eutrophic</b> <b>Lakes</b> processors and the bright pixel atmospheric correction algorithm (BPAC). The <b>Eutrophic</b> <b>Lakes</b> processor gave the most accurate atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectances at 490 nm compared to the other processors, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 47 % and a root mean square error (RMSE) 43 %, with BPAC giving negative reflectances in the blue spectral range. In situ Kd and Zeu models were calibrated and validated using above- and under-water radiometric measurements, and tested on the Neural Network atmospheric correction processed MERIS images. The <b>Eutrophic</b> <b>Lakes</b> estimates were the most accurate, with an RMSE of 0. 26 m− 1 and MAPE of 18 % for Kd(490) and RMSE of 0. 17 m and MAPE of 14 % for Zeu. The Zeu maps produced from MERIS images clearly show the variation of euphotic depth both in space and time.
