Although many alarm correlation approaches and risk assessment methods have been proposed, {{most of them were}} implemented with high computational complexity and time consuming, and they can not deal well with huge number of security alarms.

Using the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach, we found that the <b>alarm</b> <b>flow</b> has a small intrinsic dimension, and the <b>alarm</b> <b>flow</b> can be decomposed into leading components and residual components.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} master thesis {{in the education}} Industrial design engineering for a master of science degree in in Product design, at Luleå University of Technology. The objective of the assignment {{was to create a}} user interface design concept for a gas alarm, to be used in respiratory care with medical air and oxygen during ambulance transport. The educational objective was to select, apply, and immerse theories and practices relevant to the product subject and the assignment statement. The assignment was provided by Länsteknik Medical Technology in Luleå, Norrbotten. Most of the thesis assignment-related part has been carried out for the ambulance service in Luleå, after that, in consultation with Länsteknik, it was decided that the gas alarm would be developed with a focus on users in integration with the user environment. The project originated from paramedics’ complaints about the lack of easy monitoring of the flow of gas from the air and oxygen bottles. That means problems when they do not discover until afterwards if treatments are not continued, because the gas bottle is empty or incorrectly installed. Upon closer inspection of the situation it was found that there is also need for a reminder to shut off gas flow, as this is another procedure that paramedics might otherwise oversee. Hence the first task was to establish if there really is a need for a gas <b>flow</b> <b>alarm</b> and why. Further the study has been about designing proposals for a suitable gas alarm which is to sense and notify if the bottle is open, closed or when the bottle is empty. In order to provide appropriate boisterous it is needed to send out matching signals about what will be alerted. Development has taken place from two different perspectives. First a wider where the studies focused on identifying what kind of signals that are suitable for alarm presentation and for what purposes. Subsequently, a more narrow perspective in which it was determined what kind of signals that would be used, and the work was concentrated on the detailed study and modify their presentation. Consequently studies of users’ perspective and theoretical studies, focusing on how people perceive different types of alarm signals and different kinds of presentation of the signals were conducted. The thesis has thus been carried out with the assignment and focuses on current users and efficient environment, but with the support of theoretical material and suitable methodology of study Technical design. The final result is a gas alarm whose solution should be equipped with technology that senses and conveys qualitative information regarding whether a gas flow will or not, then it turned on for respiratory care. The presentation will be reactive with visual and auditory signals. When switched on, a yellow light is lit for reminding that the flow is started from the current gas bottle, so it is not forgotten after a call- out. If the stream fails, the indicator turns over to red color while audio is presented for extra attention. This also indicates that the gas runs out or the bottle is unopened, being reasons that flow can fail. The production has been limited to the minimum necessary input that the paramedics believe is relevant and that is possible to read in parallel with other work tasks. This was clarified by means of design guidelines identified within the theoretical studies. This means that the color coding and symbols used according to what suits the medical concepts and the gases that the alarm intends. Also that the placement and sizing of the input element and the gas alarm overall has been adapted relatively cause and what is visual and audible in the ambulances. The most significant issues identified during the development of user interfaces for alarm is that the presentation has to be weighed carefully in relation to the most/least that should be presented to users in the current environment. Perception and knowledge about what it consists of can be very different with developers, final users and technical intermediaries. Positive alarm- effects appears when they are recognized and interpreted, quickly and easily, succeed in influencing people to adjust. Therefore, it is vital to design and dimension relatively cause and significance, and what is possible to comply with. Negative effects that might otherwise occur, of both over and under sizing, is that the alarm is not recognized, misinterpreted or perceived as irrelevant and distracting. These aspects are particularly important to consider in the design for ambulance service, where users already before alarm presentation often find themselves in stressful and mentally demanding situations.

40|$|In Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) -type {{nuclear power}} plants, the reactor is {{composed}} of 380 fuel channels and refueling is performed {{on one or two}} channels per day. At the time of refueling, the fluid force of the cooling water inside the channel is exploited. New fuel added upstream of the fuel channel is moved downstream by the fluid force of the cooling water, and the used fuel is pushed out. Through this process, refueling is completed. Among the 380 fuel channels, outer rows 1 and 2 (called the FARE channel) make the process of using only the internal fluid force impossible because of the low flow rate of the channel cooling water. Therefore, a Flow Assist Ram Extension (FARE) tool, a refueling aid, is used to refuel these channels in order to compensate for the insufficient fluid force. The FARE tool causes flow resistance, thus allowing the fuel to be moved down with the flow of cooling water. Although the existing FARE tool can perform refueling in Korean plants, the coolant flow rate is reduced to below 80 % of the normal flow for some time during refueling. A Flow rate below 80 % of the normal flow cause low <b>flow</b> rate <b>alarm</b> signal in the plant operation. A flow rate below 80 % of the normal flow may cause difficulties in the plant operation because of the increase in the coolant temperature of the channel. A new and improved FARE tool is needed to address the limitations of the existing FARE tool. In this study, we identified the cause of the low flow phenomena of the existing FARE tool. A new and improved FARE tool has been designed and manufactured.

In order to determine the ability of people to sift through alarm information, a study of alarm detection with three ratios of target to non-target alarms was devised (i. e. 2 %, 6 %, and 10 %) and the information was presented at three rates (i. e. 1 second, 4 seconds and 8 seconds). The results show that the ratio of target alarms has no effect on detection performance, but the temporal rate does.

40|$|International audienceWhen a fault {{occurs on}} a complex process, it {{generally}} sets off many alarms from the SCADA system. The list of alarms {{raised by the}} control system from the occurrence of the fault until the <b>flow</b> of <b>alarms</b> is stabilized forms the fault signature and is the raw material used by operators to make their diagnosis. Some alarms may be raised on the occurrence on several faults while others may be specific to a given fault and thus be very useful to make the diagnostic. In order to assist the operator in his diagnostic process and help him better understand the alarm generation process, a method to evaluate the ability to discriminate a fault from a set of other faults from its alarms signature is proposed.

40|$|The Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) {{concentrates}} on probability distribution of peak flows of flood hydrographs. However, examination of floods that haunted and devastated the {{large parts of}} Poland lead us to revision of the views on the assessment of flood risk of Polish rivers. It turned out that flooding is caused not only by overflow of the levees' crest but mostly due to the prolonged exposure to high water on levees structure causing dangerous leaks and breaches that threaten their total destruction. This is because, the levees are weakened by long-lasting water pressure {{and as a matter}} of fact their damage usually occurs after the culmination has passed the affected location. The probability of inundation is the total of probabilities of exceeding embankment crest by flood peak and the probability of washout of levees. Therefore, in addition to the maximum flow one should consider also the duration of high waters in a river channel. In the paper the new two-component model of flood dynamics: "Duration of high waters–Discharge Threshold–Probability of non-exceedance" (DqF), with the methodology of its parameters estimation was proposed as a completion to the classical FFA methods. Such model can estimate the duration of stages (flows) of an assumed magnitude with a given probability of exceedance. The model combined with the technical evaluation of probability of levees breach due to the d -days duration of <b>flow</b> above <b>alarm</b> stage gives the annual probability of inundation caused by the embankment breaking. The results of theoretical investigation were illustrated by a practical example of the model implementation to the series of daily flow of the Vistula River at Szczucin. Regardless promising results, the method of risk assessment due to prolonged exposure of levees to high water is still in its infancy despite its great cognitive potential and practical importance. Therefore, we would like to point out the need for and usefulness of the DqF model as complementary to the analysis of the flood peak flows, as in classical FFA. The presented two-component model combined with the routine flood frequency model constitutes a new direction in FFA for embanked rivers...|$|R

In summer 2012 volcanic activity resumed in a milder form within the Bocca Nuova crater, before {{it came to}} an essential halt in August 2012. All these unrests offer rich material for testing automatic procedures of data processing and alert systems, running 24 / 7, {{in the context of}} volcano surveillance. We focus on the seismic background radiation – volcanic tremor – which {{plays a key role in}} the monitoring of Mt. Etna. Since 2006 a multistation alert system has been established in the INGV operative centre of Catania exploiting STA/LTA ratios. Besides, also the spectral characteristics of the signal, which change correspondingly to the type of volcanic activity, can be exploited for warning purposes. Here we apply Self Organizing Maps and Fuzzy Clustering which offer an efficient way to visualize signal characteristics and its development with time. All these techniques allow to identify early stages of eruptive events, and automatically flag a critical status before this becomes evident in conventional monitoring techniques. Changes of tremor characteristics are related to the position of the source of the signal. The location of the sources exploits the distribution of the amplitudes across the seismic network. The locations were extremely useful for warning, throughout both the flank eruption in 2008 as well as the 2011 lava fountains, during which a clear migration of tremor sources towards the eruptive centres could be noticed in advance. The location of the sources completes the picture of an imminent volcanic unrest, and corroborates early warnings flagged by the changes of signal characteristics. Real time data processing requires computational efficiency, robustness of the methods and stability of data acquisition. The amplitude based multi-station approach is not sensitive to the failure of single stations and therefore offers a good stability. The single station approach, exploiting unsupervised classification techniques, limits logistic efforts, as only one or few key stations are necessary. Both strategies have proven to be insensitive to disturbances (undesired transients like earthquakes, noise, short gaps in the continuous data <b>flow).</b> False <b>alarms</b> were not encountered so far. Stable data acquisition and processing come with a properly designed data storage solution. The reliability of data storage and its access is a critical issue. A cluster architecture has been realized for failover protection, including a Storage Area Network system, which allow easy data access following predefined user policies. We present concepts of the software architectures deployed at INGV Osservatorio Etneo in order to implement this tremor-based multi approach system. We envisage the integration of seismic data and those originating from other scientific fields (e. g., volcano imagery, geochemistry, deformation, gravity, magneto-telluric). This will facilitate cross-checking of evidences encountered from the single data streams, in particular allow their immediate verification with respect to ground truth...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{activity}} on Mt Etna {{was characterized by}} 25 lava fountains occurred on Mt Etna in 2011 and the ﬁrst semester of 2012. In summer 2012 volcanic activity in a milder form was noticed within the Bocca Nuova crater, before it came to an essential halt in August 2012. Together with previous unrests (e. g., in 2007 - 08) these events offer rich material for testing automatic data processing and alert issue {{in the context of}} volcano monitoring. Our presentation focuses on the seismic background radiation – volcanic tremor – which has {{a key role in the}} surveillance of Mt Etna. From 2006 on a multi-station alert system exploiting STA/LTA ratios, has been established in the INGV operative centre of Catania. Besides, also the frequency content has been found to change correspondingly to the type of volcanic activity, and can thus be exploited for warning purposes. We apply Self Organizing Maps and Fuzzy Clustering which offer an efﬁcient way to visualize signal characteristics and its development with time. These techniques allow to identify early stages of eruptive events and automatically ﬂag a critical status before this becomes evident in conventional monitoring techniques. Changes of tremor characteristics are related to the position of the source of the signal. Given the dense seismic network we can base the location of the sources on distribution of the amplitudes across the network. The locations proved to be extremely useful for warning throughout both a ﬂank eruption in 2008 as well as the 2011 lava fountains. During all these episodes a clear migration of tremor sources towards the eruptive centres was revealed in advance. The location of the sources completes the picture of an imminent volcanic unrest and corroborates early warnings ﬂagged by the changes of signal characteristics. Automatic real time data processing poses high demands on computational efﬁciency, robustness of the methods and stability of data acquisition. The amplitude based multi-station approach is not sensitive to the failure of single stations and therefore offers a good stability. On the other hand, the single station approach, exploiting unsupervised classiﬁcation techniques, limits logistic efforts, as only one or few key stations are necessary. A common characteristics of both strategies is their robustness to disturbances (undesired transients like earthquakes, noise, short gaps in the continuous data <b>ﬂow).</b> False <b>alarms</b> were not encountered so far. A critical issue it the reliability of data storage and access. Therefore, a speciﬁc hardware cluster architecture has been proposed for failover protection, including a Storage Area Network system. We present concepts of the software architectures which allow easy data access following predeﬁned user policies. We also envisage the integration of seismic data and those originating from other scientiﬁc ﬁelds (e. g., volcano imagery, geochemistry, deformation, gravity, magneto-telluric). This will facilitate cross-checking of evidences encountered from the single data streams, in particular allow their immediate veriﬁcation with respect to ground truth...|$|R
30|$|Various modular {{programs}} have been written in C+++[*]with GCC compiler for the functioning of developed embedded RO plant status monitoring unit. Open-source Qtopia platform {{has been used for}} graphical user interface development for data visualization and user interaction. Developed software package provides the number of facilities for hassle-free operation and regular maintenance. Few of the major features are on-site set point window for location-specific thresholds of pH, TDS, flow rate, real-time data visualization of various RO plant parameters, multiple data transfer options and RO plant operation steps in the local language. The main software module initializes the various water quality sensors, flow sensors, level sensors, pressure sensors, analog-to-digital converter, E 2 ROM, Bluetooth module, serial port, GSM module, port expander module, phase failure monitoring unit and also diagnosis of overall embedded unit. Microcontroller unit communicates with developed dedicated hardware unit using the I 2 C protocol to drive various actuators and also to acquire information from various sensors. Developed software package has menu-driven option with four different modes to operate RO plant status monitoring unit: First is data visualization mode, second is location-specific set point mode, third is data transfer mode, and the last one is training mode. Data visualization mode provides facility to access various RO plant parameters in real time and also to drive plant in different modes such as process mode, rinse mode, chemical wash mode and water wash mode. Location-specific set point mode has options to set upper and lower thresholds for critical sensors response such as pH, TDS and <b>flow.</b> System triggers <b>alarm</b> for RO plant operator as real-time sensors response crosses set points. Data transfer mode provides real-time data transfer options to cloud and server using 2 G GSM module or operator’s smartphone-based app interface while the training mode provides stepwise points for RO plant operation in the local language. All developed modular programs are linked to the main menu graphical user interface-based program to operate RO plant status monitoring unit for fault prediction and predictive maintenance. Raspbian Jessie OS has been ported raspberry pi-based embedded system and further developed software package transferred on raspberry pi 3 -based embedded system.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a statement of}} technique to research performances of multi-channel combo standalone information systems with positional analyzers of the signal states at the channel outputs. In most cases, in considered multi-channel systems there has been impossible to coincide in time the random moments of signals coming from the objects through various channels in all ways of encounter environment and conditions of practical application. The analyzer makes decision on the signal using the discrete operations on the quantized signals of the certain duration from the channel outputs. The analyzer performance is described {{by a set of}} Boolean algebra functions defined for all possible states of the signals at the outputs of the channels, and in the general case is specified in a perfect disjunctive normal form. To determine the validity or falsity of functions of the algebra of logics, which are calculated statements concerning the available or unavailable useful signal at the system input, on the authority of the Poretsky’s theorem and the theory of coincidence in time of the random pulse flow of the channels response because of uncorrelated and correlated noise, are obtained dependences to calculate the probabilities of false alarms and omissions of the signals in discrete combined systems. It is shown that the <b>flows</b> of false <b>alarms</b> because of noise at the channel outputs in the system are Poisson streams. On the basis of the ordinary Poisson flows the paper justifies the relationships for calculating the false alarms of the system with uncorrelated and correlated noise in the channels. The paper also justifies the relationships for performance of multichannel combined systems with positional analyzers of the channels states. Based on the obtained relationships was calculated the average coincidence frequency of the extended pulses of the channel response in a dualchannel system, depending on the noise cross-correlation coefficient with different extended pulse durations and relative response thresholds in the channels. The impact of cross-correlation noise has been analysed. The obtained results enable us to examine the performance of the multichannel autonomous information systems with positional analyzers of the signal states at the outputs of channels operating under uncorrelated and correlated noise...|$|R
