25|$|In {{terms of}} working conditions, {{a number of}} reforms were {{introduced}} aimed at strengthening the rights of workers {{both at home and}} in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> while maternity leave was increased. Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness. In 1970 all employees unit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably employed persons) were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer's supplement and sick pay were only made from the day on which the doctor certified unfitness for work. In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work. A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the trends of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in the Czech Republic since 1990. These trends {{are related to the}} {{legislative}} and socioeconomic changes, which are the results of transformation of socialist society towards capitalist society. In this thesis, there are followed three main indicators of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The number of cases of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> per 100 sickness insured persons, which has dropped since the beginning 1990; the number of calendar days of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> per 1 case, which has on the contrary increased and the average percentage of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> which has oscillated. The performed analyses have proved the crucial effect of sickness intensity (quantum) on changes of the values of mentioned indicators. The effect of intensity has explicitly outweighed the effect of age structure of population. Regression analysis has confirmed the hypothesis of causation of other factors, than only health factors, on the global level of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> With respect to obtained information and level of sickness intensity by age and social groups, there is an issue of possibility and manner of reduction of their level, which exceeds the European average.

40|$|The {{alarming}} {{increase of}} <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> The increase of <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in Belgium and in Europe {{is not a}} new phenomenon but only the transposition of an experience already lived on others continents (Canada - USA). The biopsycho- social model proves to be, on the international level, as the more efficient view for the understanding of the mechanisms production of the disability and therefore of the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> Following this approach, the chronic pain {{is the result of the}} dynamic interaction between physiological, psychological and social factors. It mentions also an existing link between the pain and the depression itself being a determining factor in the persistence of the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The bio-psycho-social model can only be conceived in the interdisciplinary approach, and will for sure allow to optimize the support and the use of medicines with a painkiller and depressive aim. The socio-economic impact created represents actually a real health problem. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The dissertation deals with both absenteeism of sick individuals, i. e. the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> due to disease or injury, and presenteeism, that is the performance of gainful employment despite acutely impaired health condition. Due to the different nature and level of knowledge of the examined phenomena, each of them is devoted a different level of attention. The issue of the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> due to disease or injury is analyzed in more detail. Development of the parametric values is set in the context of administration and legal changes, which have occurred in the Czech Republic since the early 1990 s, and conditionality of the occurrence of the <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> due to disease or injury are further investigated based on individual anonymized data.

40|$|Sickness {{insurance}} as part {{of social}} insurance is obligatory {{for a majority of}} Czech citizens – i. e., they are required by law to pay this insurance. On the other hand, they are entitled to certain benefits of this system in the case of social events determined by law. Legislative changes in sickness insurance significantly influenced the development of all indicators of temporary <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> (TIW) in individual regions. These changes are reflected most markedly in the indicators of the number of new cases of TIW per 100 insured persons, the average duration of 1 case of TIW and the average percentage of TIW. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an idea of sickness insurance, especially of the impact of legal regulation changes in the system of this insurance on employees, who represent the largest share of socially insured persons, focusing on Prague, the Moravian-Silesian and the South-Moravian regions. The impact of changes in sickness insurance will be presented by selected indicators of temporary <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> using regression analysis to estimate the development of individual indicators in the following years based on knowledge of the development of indicators in the years 2000 – 2014.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the difficulties which {{people with mental}} health conditions may experience in establishing and maintaining entitlement to the social security benefits which underwrite <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> Two regimes are currently operating simultaneously, the incapacity benefits regime, introduced in 1995, and employment and support allowance (ESA), introduced in October 2008. The thesis identifies the main barriers to <b>incapacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> benefits for people with mental health problems as the symptoms of mental illness, administrative procedures, national insurance contribution conditions, assessment, conditionality, appeals {{and complexity of the}} welfare system. It compares the two regimes and concludes that although problems arise with both incapacity benefits and ESA, problems with ESA are greater. The ESA scheme and ongoing reforms appear to have worked well for people who are at the most severe end of the spectrum of mental illness, since they receive more money and are relieved of conditionality.
