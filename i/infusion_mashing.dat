50|$|Smaller breweries {{will often}} use a boil kettle or a lauter tun for mashing. The latter case either limits the brewer to single-step <b>infusion</b> <b>mashing</b> or leaves the brewer with a lauter tun {{that is not}} {{completely}} appropriate for the lautering process.|$|E
50|$|Most breweries use <b>infusion</b> <b>mashing,</b> {{in which}} the mash is heated {{directly}} to go from rest temperature to rest temperature. Some infusion mashes achieve temperature changes by adding hot water, {{and there are also}} breweries that do single-step infusion, performing only one rest before lautering.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quality of}} {{starches}} in a grain is variable with {{the strain of}} grain used and its growing conditions. [...] "Modification" [...] refers specifically {{to the extent to}} which starch molecules in the grain consist of simple chains of starch molecules versus branched chains; a fully modified grain contains only simple-chain starch molecules. A grain that is not fully modified requires mashing in multiple steps rather than at simply one temperature as the starches must be de-branched before amylase can work on them. One indicator of the degree of modification of a grain is that grain's Nitrogen ratio; that is, the amount of soluble Nitrogen (or protein) in a grain vs. the total amount of Nitrogen(or protein). This number is also referred to as the [...] "Kolbach Index" [...] and a malt with a Kolbach index between 36% and 42% is considered a malt that is highly modified and suitable for single <b>infusion</b> <b>mashing.</b> Maltsters use the length of the acrospire vs. the length of the grain to determine when the appropriate degree of modification has been reached before drying or kilning.|$|E

[...] These records describe an <b>infusion</b> <b>mash</b> that included a 30-minute acid rest at 38 C, a 30 to 60 minute protease rest at 52 C, an α-amylase rest for 30 minutes at 70 C, and a mash out at 75 C.

5000|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of {{combining}} a mix of milled grain (typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat), known as the [...] "grain bill", and water, known as [...] "liquor", and heating this mixture in a vessel called a [...] "mash tun". Mashing is a form of steeping, and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, sake, and soy sauce. Technically, wine, cider and mead are not brewed but rather vinified, as there is no steeping process involving solids. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort. There are two main methods - <b>infusion</b> <b>mashing,</b> in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and decoction mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably 45 - 62 - 73 C), and takes place in a [...] "mash tun" [...] - an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom. The end product of mashing is called a [...] "mash".|$|E
40|$|Hot {{water extract}} (HWE) {{is one of}} the key quality {{attributes}} considered when determining the malting performance of barley. The international malting and brewing industries utilise standard procedures for measuring HWE, including European Brewery Convention (Analytica - EBC 1998), Institute of Brewing (IOB - Methods of Analysis 1997), and American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC - Methods of Analysis 1992). EBC and ASBC procedures are similar and use a multi-temperature programmed mashing profile, while the IOB procedure uses a constant temperature <b>infusion</b> <b>mashing</b> profile. In Australia, maltsters and brewers generally use the EBC procedure to determine extract levels on commercial samples. Specific quality goals for developing Australian commercial barley varieties include a high extract carbohydrate potential with a desired level in excess of 82...|$|E
50|$|The brewery (located at 206 N. Benton St., #C in Kennewick) uses a 10-barrel (bbl) {{system and}} uses a {{single-stage}} <b>infusion</b> <b>mash</b> system. The brewery is capable of producing an annual yield of 1300 bbls, both for sale outside the brewery and in the brewpub.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, sahti is brewed using a long step <b>infusion</b> <b>mash</b> {{that may}} {{last up to}} six hours, after which the wort is lautered through the kuurna. Unlike most beers, {{traditional}} sahti wort goes straight from the lauter tun to the fermenter without boiling. This gives it a relatively short shelf-life and may cause some characteristic sour flavors to develop from Lactobacillus bacteria.|$|R
50|$|A two-step <b>infusion</b> <b>mash</b> is {{typically}} performed, {{after which the}} beers are fermented in one of four cylindro-conical tanks at warm temperatures for up to 7 days, then cold-conditioned {{for a period of}} 2-3 weeks, after which they are dosed with sugar and stored in a warm room to naturally carbonate in the bottle or keg. The beers are unfiltered and continue to condition and mature after packaging, although the brewer advises drinking them within one year. English and Czech hop varieties are primarily used, and some of the recipes utilize spices as well.|$|R
