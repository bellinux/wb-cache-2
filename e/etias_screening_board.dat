50|$|The first initial {{steps of}} making a Marine into a {{qualified}} Reconnaissance Marine starts at the recon selection, or <b>screening</b> <b>board,</b> regardless if it is for assignment to Radio Recon, Scout Snipers, Division Recon, or Force Recon.

The <b>screening</b> <b>board</b> is a 48-hour event that is held on the last Thursday of each month at either MCB Camp Pendleton or MCB Camp Lejeune; the FMF Reconnaissance and all the organic division reconnaissance assets conduct their own distinct selection process from one another.

50|$|The primary {{work of the}} Foundation is the {{identification}} and screening of potential grantees and oversight once a grant is awarded. The Grant <b>Screening</b> <b>Board</b> {{is made up of}} 20 Everychild members who spend the year reviewing proposals and ultimately selecting two finalists. The process includes review of documents provided by the grant applicant, site visits, and analysis of the need for and viability of the proposed project and its budget. To prevent an entrenched group controlling the Foundation's grant process, committee terms are for three years and are staggered for continuity. The Foundation has two other major operating committees. The Grant Outreach Committee is responsible for contacting agencies that may have a proposal that is eligible for the Everychild grant. If an agency appears eligible, committee members work with it to help it prepare Letters of Inquiry, the first stage of the grant application process. Membership on this committee is limited to those who have already served on the Grant <b>Screening</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{hearings}} {{lasted for}} 36 days and were broadcast on live television by ABC and DuMont, {{with an estimated}} 20 million viewers. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in [...] "unduly persistent or aggressive efforts". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams [...] "made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth", and that Adams [...] "made vigorous and diligent efforts" [...] to block subpoenas {{for members of the}} Army Loyalty and <b>Screening</b> <b>Board</b> [...] "by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [...] committee".|$|R

2500|$|Common {{mechanical}} controls generally rely on disruption of {{some aspect of}} the mites' lifecycle. [...] These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. [...] Examples of {{mechanical controls}} include drone brood sacrifice (varroa mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), <b>screened</b> bottom <b>boards</b> (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size. A device called the varroa mite control entrance (VMCE) is under development as of 2008. The VMCE works in conjunction with a <b>screened</b> bottom <b>board,</b> by dislodging varroa mites from bees as they enter and exit a hive.|$|R
50|$|Perforated {{bottom board}} method {{is used by}} many beekeepers on their hives. When mites {{occasionally}} fall off a bee, they must climb back up to parasitize another bee. If the beehive has a screened floor with mesh the right size, the mite will fall through and cannot return to the beehive. The <b>screened</b> bottom <b>board</b> is also being credited with increased circulation of air, which reduces condensation in a hive during the winter. Studies at Cornell University done over two years found that screened bottoms have no measurable effect at all. <b>Screened</b> bottom <b>boards</b> with sticky boards (glue traps) separate mites that fall through the screen and the sticky board prevents them from crawling back up. Insecticide may also {{be applied to the}} sticky boards to help kill the mites.|$|R
5000|$|On July 24, 1997, President Clinton {{nominated}} Rangel to {{a vacancy}} on the Fifth Circuit {{that had been}} created by Judge William Lockhart Garwood taking senior status. Rangel's nomination ran into trouble, because {{as a member of}} an American Bar Association <b>screening</b> <b>board</b> in the 1980s and early 1990s, Rangel had been critical of some Republicans, including of President Reagan's 1986 ultimately unsuccessful nomination to the federal bench of Jeff Sessions, who later became a senator and member of the very U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee reviewing Rangel's nomination. [...] In addition, the U.S. Senate was controlled by Republicans during the balance of Clinton's second term, causing Rangel's nomination to languish. Rangel waited more than a year for a hearing from the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but never received one.|$|R

50|$|Digital sign {{displays}} may be LCD or plasma <b>screens,</b> LED <b>boards,</b> projection <b>screens</b> {{or other}} emerging display types like interactive surfaces or organic LED screens (OLEDs).

2500|$|After hearing 32 {{witnesses}} and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Roy Cohn, McCarthy's chief counsel, {{had engaged in}} some [...] "unduly persistent or aggressive efforts" [...] for Schine. The conclusion also reported questionable behavior {{on the part of}} the Army: That Secretary Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams [...] "made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth", and that Adams [...] "made vigorous and diligent efforts" [...] to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and <b>Screening</b> <b>Board</b> [...] "by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [...] committee". Before the official reports were released Cohn had resigned as McCarthy's chief counsel, and Senator Ralph Flanders (R, Vermont) had introduced a resolution of censure against McCarthy in the Senate.|$|R
