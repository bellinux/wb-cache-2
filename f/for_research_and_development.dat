5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention <b>for</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> and government support.|$|E
5|$|Adam {{is convicted}} {{for the murder}} of his ex-wife, Skye Newman (Laura Stone). Sharon tries to help him, but is arrested for murder after finding Skye in Hawaii (where Skye fell into a volcano). After {{escaping}} and returning (after several months of being thought dead), Sharon is acquitted. She then dedicates herself to Victor, who is in jail protecting Nikki from a murder charge. Victor marries Sharon platonically to protect his assets, although the marriage is annulled two weeks later. Adam is believed to be permanently blind after an attack by Patty Williams, and Sharon helps him recover. They reunite, but more of his past schemes are revealed. After another nervous breakdown and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (which made her remarry Victor and take over Newman Enterprises), Sharon is re-hired at Newman as vice president <b>for</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> Adam is shot saving Victor's life; before slipping into a coma he asks Sharon, his closest friend, to run Newman Enterprises. Sharon again becomes CEO of the company, angering the Newman's. She leaves the company upon Victor's return to run the company with Adam. Victor forces Adam, who is engaging in a sexual relationship with Sharon, to stop seeing her.|$|E
5|$|From October 1951 to May 1954 Wolson was Commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

At the time, the Third Air Force {{was responsible for the}} only tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, so Wilson was a logical choice as commander. After returning to the United States in July 1957, he became the Air Force member of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense <b>for</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development.</b> He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 July 1958 when he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Development.

5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million <b>for</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding <b>for</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E
5|$|Tizard put his {{thoughts}} in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member <b>for</b> <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development.</b> He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would only need to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E
