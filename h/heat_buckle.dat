Efficiency of using BRBs in enhancing the strength and stiffness of a structural frame is compared with that of Ordinary Concentrically Bracing system (OCBs) under various fire scenarios. The proposed numerical model is verified by a series of full-scale fire tests carried out on an 8 -storey structure at Cardington. The results indicate that the vertical movement of <b>heated</b> (<b>buckled)</b> column in the structural frame with BRBs is lesser than that with OCBs. Consequently, the tensile force and bending moment of the beam adjacent to the buckled column in the former is lesser than the latter. Also, BRB elements can perform better in redistributing the load sustained by heated columns without any buckling occurrence in the bracing member, in comparisons to the ordinary system. In general, it is observed that BRBs manifest an improved performance in re-stabilization of structural frame against fire {{for a longer period of}} heating time, such that a better fire resistance is offered to the whole building as compared to OCBs, due to a higher restraint provided onto the structur...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of restrained steel columns in fire. It follows {{the introduction of}} extra load into the column through the axial restraint of the surrounding cooler structure and the consequential buckling. Key to this understanding is the post-failure behaviour and re-stabilisation of the column, which is discussed with reference to a finite element model and an analytical model. Through bi-directional control of the temperature, the finite element model allows the snap-back behaviour to be modelled in detail {{and the effects of}} varying slenderness and load ratio are investigated. The analytical model employs structural mechanics to describe the behaviour of a heated strut, and is capable of explaining both elastic and fully plastic post-buckling behaviour. Through this detailed explanation of what happens when a <b>heated</b> column <b>buckles,</b> the consequences for steel-framed building design are discussed. In particular, the need to provide robustness is highlighted, {{in order to ensure that}} alternative load paths are available once a column has buckled and re-stabilised. Without this robustness, the dynamic shedding of load onto surrounding structures may well spread failure from a fire's origin and lead to progressive collapse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|When fire {{takes place}} in a steel frame, any <b>heated</b> column may <b>buckle</b> at some {{temperature}} due to deterioration in both the stiffness and the strength, although the external load to the frame remains unchanged during fire. This column’s buckling is likely a main cause of the instability for steel frames subjected to fire. Researches on the high temperature buckling of columns span, in fact, for decades. Culver (1973) was the first to analyze precisely the behavior of the buckling of columns by using finite element analysis. Referring to the experimental studies conducted by Burgess et al. (1992), Franssen has recently made a specific comparison between the test and numerical analysis results (1995, 1996). Although the studies on centrally compressed and simply supported columns provide the basic knowledge on the problem, the behaviors of the heated columns incorporated into the frame are different from those of isolated members. In fact, when fire occurs in a steel frame, the expanded and therefore elongated column is axially restrained by the rest of members, so that thermal compressive force is applied additionally to the heated column (Neves, 1995; Correia Rodrigues et al., 2000). As a result, the buckling temperature of the heated column is lowered due to this thermal stress. On the other hand, since the incorporated column is, at the same time, restrained rotationally at its ends by the neighboring members, the effective length of this column should become shorter than the column height and this raises in turn the buckling temperature of the column. Another facet of the problem is the overall stability of the frame, when and after the incorporated columns buckle due to fire. Some frames may fall into instability directly after the incorporated column buckle, while the other may remain stable and be able to sustain further increase in member temperature. Once the instability takes place, the former frame cannot maintain static equilibrium any more. This means that, to solve the problem, ordinary load controlled analysis is not applicable in this case, but we need to develop another new numerical method to analyze the unstable frames. For the latter stable frames with <b>heated</b> and <b>buckled</b> columns, on the other hand, stress redistribution capacity of the neighboring members may play an essential role on controlling their ultimate states. Therefore, to clarify the structural performances of the frames with <b>heated</b> and <b>buckled</b> columns, a special emphasis must be placed on their stabilities as well as their ultimate load carrying characteristics when and after several <b>heated</b> columns <b>buckle.</b> The adopted analysis method must be able to trace these natures of the problem accordingly. In view of the above observations, the main objectives of this study are to be set as follows: 1. To understand and to clarify the mechanics which control the overall stabilities of steel frames with <b>heated</b> and <b>buckled</b> columns. 2. To develop a numerical analysis program that can solve such stability problems of steel frames subjected to fire. 3. To clarify the buckling temperatures of the incorporated columns as well as the frame’s ultimate temperatures. 4. To find the actual ultimate states and the corresponding ultimate temperatures of steel frames subjected to fire. 5. To find the means to prevent the frames subjected to fire from instability. In order to achieve the above presented objectives, this dissertation is divided into five chapters, which are briefly described below. Chapter one starts with brief review of previous studies. Fire resistant design of steel structures is reviewed in many relevant aspects, the experimental tests, and numerical analysis. After that, the problem about instability in steel structure that occurred in the collapse of WTC Towers is summarized. This is considered an indispensable background for conceiving the objective of this study, which constitutes the above sections. In chapter 2, the stabilities and the ultimate behaviors of steel frames after the incorporated <b>heated</b> columns <b>buckle</b> are investigated extensively. If the surrounding members can redistribute the vertical load of the frame which has been carried by the buckled column, it may retain the stability and may not collapse immediately. On the contrary, when the surrounding members are weak, an overall frame will fall into instability directly due to column buckling. This chapter describes and discusses these problems specifically. Furthermore, in this chapter, the development of the numerical analysis method is described specifically, which can simulate both the stable and unstable behaviors of steel frames subjected to fire. The development is focused on the computational procedure to simulate an unstable and therefore actually a dynamic frame behavior purely by a static means. At the end of this chapter, example numerical solutions solved by the method developed are shown, where complete fire responses and realistic ultimate states due to fire of steel frames are illustrated and discussed extensively. By using the numerical method whereby the control of the analysis is switched between load and displacement methods, we can examine the behavior of the steel column subjected to fire until it overall collapses. The load controlled analysis is the increase-in-temperature method. While the displacement analysis is the analysis that one degree-of-freedom of the unstable member’s node is gripped, and it is moved in the direction that the unstable state is growing. The displacement analysis is carried out under the temperature that the structure loses its stability. By using this analysis method to analyze some examples of a steel structure subjected to fire, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The main unstable condition of a steel structure subjected to fire is the “snap-through” process. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. That means that the structure’s ability to remain stable while the surrounding members restrain the buckling column is intimately connected with the instabilities of the structure itself. ･ The collapse of the structure is not decided solely by the <b>buckling</b> of the <b>heated</b> column. The ultimate temperature of the structure’s collapse mode varies according to the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members. If the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is low, the structure loses its stability and collapses suddenly after the column buckles. In this case, the ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is lower than the column buckling temperature due to the thermal stress. However, if the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is high, the structure still keeps its stability even though the column buckles. The ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is more than the column buckling temperature. The third chapter clarifies specifically the buckling temperatures of steel columns incorporated into frames. The buckling temperature is defined as the one at which a column begins to show an apparent buckling deformation. The incorporated columns are restrained rotationally by the adjacent members when they buckle. Therefore the effective buckling length of the column is shorter than its height. In this chapter, simple closed form formulae are presented to estimate both the effective buckling length and the buckling temperature of an incorporated heated column. Finally, comparisons are made between the numerically solved buckling temperatures of incorporated columns and the corresponding theoretical predictions, and the accuracy and the applicability of the formula are discussed in detail. From the investigated results, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The rotationally restraining effect of the connecting members has an effect on the column’s buckling temperature. However, the thermal expansion of the beam does not have a direct affect on the buckling temperature. ･ The exterior column is not axially restrained by the adjacent members during the fire. The lower end of the heated column is rotationally restrained by the unheated connecting members, so its boundary condition can be assumed to be fixed end. On the other hand, for {{the upper end of the}} heated column’s case, the rotationally restraining effect of the upper-story unheated column can be neglected due to the thermal expansion of the beam. The buckling temperature of the exterior column can be assumed to be the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. ･ The interior column is strongly rotationally restrained by the adjacent members, so its effective length is equal to 0. 5 h. However, it is also axially restrained by the adjacent members. As a result it buckles at a temperature that is lower than the estimated buckling temperature. In this case, when considering the buckling temperature, the thermal effect should be included. An incorporated column is not only restrained rotationally as discussed in the previous chapter but, if it is heated, it is also restrained axially by the surrounding members. Chapter 4 clarifies the latter problems specifically. The axial restraint of the surrounding members plays two contrary roles on the stability action of the frame. Firstly, it adds axial compressive force to the incorporated column and so increased compressive force lowers the column’s buckling temperature. On the contrary, once the column buckles, the surrounding members turn to work so as to redistribute a part of the axial compressive force carried by the bucked column to other sound columns, which is therefore helps to strengthen the overall stability and to raise the ultimate temperature of the frame. This is called herein stress redistribution effect of the surrounding members. In this chapter, the lowering of the column’s buckling temperature and the raise of the frame’s ultimate temperature, which are both brought by the effects of the surrounding members, are formulated respectively in theoretical closed forms. Finally the numerical analysis, which are developed in Chapter 2, are conducted extensively to obtain the realistic column’s buckling and the frame’s ultimate temperatures of a lot of practical steel frames, which are used to verify the accuracy and the applicability of the above derived formulae. In this chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The effects of the axially restraining members have two mechanical roles. The first role is to restrain an expanded heated column. As a result of this action, the thermal compressive force is added to the heated column. This causes a drop in <b>buckling</b> temperature of <b>heated</b> columns. On the contrary, the second role is to redistribute a part of the compressive force of the buckled column to other sound columns. As a result of this action, the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. It causes a rise of the ultimate temperature of a frame. However, if the second stress redistribution ability is not enough, it falls into instability immediately after the <b>heated</b> column <b>buckles.</b> The ultimate temperature for this frame is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature, since the buckling is affected by the first thermal effect. ･ Based on the above observation, it is found that a higher ultimate temperature of a frame is obtained if it has higher stress redistribution capacity. A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a frame is to install a suitably proportioned hat truss. A hatted frame is found to have definitely an improved redundancy. ･ Closed form formulae to predict both the buckling temperature of a heated column and the beam plastified temperature of a frame is presented herein. Conducting the numerical fire response analysis, the predicted temperatures are found to be in good agreement with the numerical results for various structural and heating conditions. The prediction to estimate the improved ultimate temperature of hatted frames is also proposed herein. In chapter 5, the conclusion of this thesis is drawn: ･ The “snap-through” phenomenon is the main unstable condition of steel structures subjected to fire. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. ･ The column’s buckling temperature can be estimated by the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. The exterior column’s effective length ratio can be calculated from the proposed equation while the interior column’s effective length ratio is 0. 5. ･ In the case that the stress redistribution ability is not enough to retain the stability of the steel frame, the structure falls into the instability state and failure at the buckling temperature under thermal effect. It means the ultimate temperature of that structure is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature. However, in the case that the stress redistribution ability is high, a part of the compressive force of the buckled column is redistributed to other sound columns. As a result the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. ･ The ultimate temperature can be determined by the higher temperature among the bucking temperature under thermal effect and the beam plastified temperature. ･ A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a steel frame is to increase the redundancy of the axial force to the steel frame.

In other words, their main goal {{is to provide a}} sufficient surface needed to transfer heat with minimum pressure drop of an airside. The air-centres are thin-walled structures made of wrought aluminium alloy with a ratio between a minimum dimension and a thickness at least of 85. In addition, they create a necessary structural support for heat exchanger tubes and thanks to them a heat exchanger cores have a required structural resistance. The current heat exchanger structural designs were developed based on ground of many years’ developments having regard to field failures and complex manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, there are still design issues, which need to be clarified {{and one of them is}} the structural design requirements of the air centres. The goal of this paper is to show importance of the post-buckling resistance of the air-centres on the overall structural integrity of the heat-exchanger core. The work is focused on the post-buckling behaviour of the air-centres taking into consideration different material properties in an elasto-plastic range and the different thickness. Both parameters have influence on stress level in the heat-exchangers tubes. The varying stresses in the tubes are main roots of field failure of the <b>heat</b> exchangers. The <b>buckled</b> shapes of the air centres cause the reduction of the tube stiffness supports. Thus, they causes high tube stresses, which in turn reduce significantly field lifetime of the heat exchangers. The problem is very much practical due to continuous trend on nowadays-automotive market to decrease the thickness of components of heat exchangers in order to cut cost of final products. Unfortunately, there is not a clear limit of the thickness reduction considering the strength (pressure resistance) of the core. In addition, the strength material requirements are not visibly defined in terms of the overall pressure core resistance. This work is going to bring some estimation of the thickness and the material strength requirements of the air centres taking into consideration the complex buckling problem. The current nominal thickness of the air-centres is about 0. 075 mm with a trend to reduce.

40|$|The local {{material}} {{expansion and}} contraction involved in welding result in permanent deformations or instability i. e., welding distortion. Considerable {{efforts have been}} made in controlling welding distortion prior to, during or after welding. Thermal Tensioning (TT) describes a group of in-situ methods to control welding distortion. In these methods local heating and/or cooling strategies are applied during welding. Additional heating and/or cooling sources can be implemented either stationary or in a transient state. In static methods, a pre-set temperature distribution is imposed on the workpiece, while in transient methods, the temperature depends on the position and the time. The mechanisms of distortion reduction in thermal tensioning are complex. The complicated nature of welding stress and strain fields is increased by the large number of parameters involved in thermal tensioning. Type, intensity and characteristics of the additional heating and/or cooling sources {{play an important role in}} the development of the stress and strain fields during welding with thermal tensioning. The positioning of the additional sources with respect to the welding centre line and the welding torch are other critical parameters involved in thermal tensioning. In this work the focus is on dynamic method using heating strategies (welding with additional heating) and can be classified into two types, Transient Thermal Tensioning and Side Heating. If the additional heaters are located close to the welding torch and contribute to the thermal field of the welds, the process is called transient thermal tensioning. If there is no interference to the thermal field of the weld, the process is called side heating. In this study, the thermal, the microstructural and the mechanical fields for both conventional welding and welding with additional heating were investigated by means of numerical models and by experimental methods including temperature, distortion and residual stress measurements and by microstructural investigations. The usage of both experimental and numerical work has provided valuable insight into welding with additional heating. Three case studies were defined for laboratory tests (with different materials: AISI- 316 L, DP 600 and AH 36 steels) and one case study was set for industrial implementation (AH 36 steel). The experiments consisted of two tracks: conventional welding and welding with additional heating. Welding parameters were selected to obtain a sound weld. The parameters concerning the additional heating sources were systematic investigated. The conditions where deformation was reduced, referred to as 'experimentally obtained minimum distortion' were used for further study and to validate numerical models. For the experimentally obtained minimum distortion (for different materials), temperature was measured using thermocouples at the underside of the plate during conventional welding and welding with additional heating. The out-of-plane distortions of the plates before and after welding and welding with additional heating were measured by means of the digital image correlation method. The microstructure of the weld metal, the heat affected zone of the weld (HAZ-welding), the base metal and the heated area beneath the burners (HAZ-welding with additional heating) were studied at a cross section perpendicular to the weld and in the middle of the plate for all materials. Residual stress measurements were performed on AISI- 316 L and DP 600 steel plates by means of neutron diffraction (ND) at the Paul Scherrer Institute. At the Laboratoire Leon Brillouin, the residual stress profiles of AH 36 plates were also measured by ND. It was found from the experiments that transient thermal tensioning using the burners applied in this study cannot reduce welding distortion (with the materials and experimental conditions employed in this study), while side heating can successfully reduce out-of-plane deformation for the selected materials. In order to apply transient thermal tensioning, the heating source should be localized, for example by laser heating. In side heating, for all of the materials studied, it was found that the closer the burners were to the weld centre line the higher deformation obtained. Moreover, the trend in distortion as a function of the burner positions (leading, parallel or trailing) relative to the welding torch was non-linear. The results of distortion measurements indicated that the distortion of the plates is less sensitive to this parameter. Experiments showed that side heating temperatures in the range of 200 - 400 C, defined at the underside of the plate, can reduce deformations for all materials. Higher temperatures cause severe plastic deformation and with lower temperatures no visible change will occur. The best temperature for welding with additional heating depends on many factors such as the position of the burners, the thermal and the mechanical material properties, the clamping system around the weld, the area heated by the burners, the geometry of the plate, the welding process and so on. It was seen that for all materials, the thermal field around the welds is not changed by additional heaters. The introduction of the additional heat by the burners is limited. Although at the top surface of the plate, higher temperatures are obtained. This causes minor changes in microstructure and mechanical properties. For example, the areas beneath the burners in DP 600 showed a lower micro-hardness than the base metal. For AH 36 steel plate, the top surface of the heated areas beneath the burners showed a re-crystallized microstructure, while the microstructure of the underside surface is not affected. It was seen that the maximum tensile residual stresses in the HAZ (of welding) for both the conventionally welded plates and AISI- 316 L plates welded with side heating were similar. This was also true for the maximum compressive stresses. Welding with side heating induces tensile stresses beneath the burner positions in the order of 200 MPa. For DP 600, the maximum tensile stresses at the weld and HAZ (of welding) for conventional welds and welds with side heating were again similar and there was tensile stress peaks at the areas beneath the burners. In the region beneath and close to the burners, compressive residual stresses are reduced in welding with side heating compared with those of conventional welding of AH 36. However, the tensile stress peak was not observed in AH 36. Finite element models were constructed to simulate and investigate the thermal, the microstructural and the mechanical fields in both conventional welding and welding with additional heating (both for side heating and transient thermal tensioning). The assumptions made in the high temperature material properties, plastic strain resetting, modelling of clamps and the additional heaters resulted in some discrepancies between the models and the measurements. For the conventional welding process, close matches between the temperature, residual stress and distortion measurements and the numerical predictions were observed. The main sources of deviation in the thermal modelling of both conventional welding and welding with side heating are related to the thermal material data at elevated temperature and the heat transfer coefficients. The essential feature of the welding with side heating is the creation of a temperature peak at the location of the burners. The temperature distribution in the weld zone and the HAZ (of welding) remains unchanged. The effect of phase transformations on residual stress and distortion was studied only for DP 600. The phase fractions were validated. Although, the predicted phase fractions were in an acceptable range compared to the experiments, it was found that the model with solid state phase transformations predicts an out-of-plane deformation 9 % lower than the model excluding the effects of the transformations and closer to the measured values. However, the risk of computational instability and divergence is high when phase transformations are included; therefore for other cases, the microstructural field was ignored. The out-of-plane deformation of the workpiece after conventional welding and welding with side heating was predicted and the distributions were quantified using different criteria: i) a distortion index, ii) an out-of-plane deformation contour and iii) a scan along a line perpendicular to the weld centre line. For all materials the predictions of conventional welding are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements. The predicted residual stresses are close to the measured values for both conventionally welded plates and plates after side heating. The characteristic of side heating from a numerical point of view is the creation of tensile residual stresses at the location of the burners (even for AH 36 steel, tensile peaks were observed in the numerical results for the regions beneath the burners). The predictions of the numerical models developed in this study showed a good agreement with the experimental results and were used to study the mechanisms responsible for distortion reduction when additional heating (side heating or transient thermal tensioning) is used. The results of the simulations indicate that the responsible mechanism of distortion reduction for transient thermal tensioning using leading and parallel burners is the reduction of the transient compressive stresses along the weld centre line. In transient thermal tensioning using trailing burners, the responsible mechanism of distortion reduction is related to the increase of the transient tensile stresses along the weld centre line to the yield point and yielding of the weld metal during cooling. In side heating, it was found that the transient stresses along the weld centre line are not influenced by the stresses generated by the side heaters. The area with tensile residual stresses (at the position beneath the burners) tends to increase the strain required for out-of-plane deformation. The redistribution of final stresses (stresses formed due to the welding process in combination with the stresses formed due to the additional heating) reduce the final deformation of the plate. During side heating, there are three regions with tensile peaks, two more than in conventional welding. The total width of tensile stress regions is increased due to side heating and the critical buckling load will be larger than that of conventional welding. In other words, side <b>heating</b> reduces <b>buckling</b> deformation by increasing the critical buckling load and not by the reduction of compressive stresses. The implementation of side heating during welding of large plates in the shipbuilding industry showed that side heating can significantly reduce welding distortion.
