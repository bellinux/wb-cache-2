40|$|AbstractThis article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of Boris Pasternak's translation of two poems by the Lachian poet Óndra Łysohorsky (1905 – 1989), made from “podstrochniki” (<b>interlinears)</b> provided here as an original archival publication together with Łysohorsky's two accompanying letters to Pasternak from 1943.

The translations are also compared to Lidiia Pasternak's English versions of the same poems published in 1968...|$|R

25|$|The translators {{appear to}} have {{otherwise}} made no first-hand study of ancient manuscript sources, even those that – like the Codex Bezae – would have been readily available to them. In addition to all previous English versions (including, and contrary to their instructions, the Rheimish New Testament which in their preface they criticized); they made wide and eclectic use of all printed editions in the original languages then available, including the ancient Syriac New Testament printed with an <b>interlinear</b> Latin gloss in the Antwerp Polyglot of 1573. In the preface the translators acknowledge consulting translations and commentaries in Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.|$|E

2500|$|As {{preliminary}} {{work to the}} full edition, Wordsworth published the text of certain important manuscripts in the series Old-Latin Biblical Texts, {{with the help of}} William Sanday, White (professor of New Testament studies at King's College, London), and other scholars. Wordsworth was consecrated Bishop of Salisbury in 1885, and White (who became Dean of Christ Church College, Oxford in 1920) assumed co-editorship of the edition, which began to be published in fascicles with the Gospel of Matthew in 1889; the first volume, with an extensive epilogue discussing the history of the manuscripts and the text, was completed in 1898. [...] In the gospel volumes, the Oxford editors printed an <b>interlinear</b> text from the Codex Brixianus, believing this to represent the most likely representative of Jerome's Old Latin source text; but subsequent studies linking the Codex Brixianus to the Gothic version of the New Testament make this supposition unlikely.|$|E

5000|$|In {{linguistics}} and pedagogy, an <b>interlinear</b> gloss is a gloss (series of brief explanations, such as definitions or pronunciations) placed between lines ( [...] + [...] ), such {{as between}} {{a line of}} original text and its translation into another language.
