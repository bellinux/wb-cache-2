Wide-band Gaussian-noise input signals, together with the high values of gain required, make that figures of merit, such as the 1 dB compression (1 dBc) point of amplifiers, become crucial in the design process of radiometric receivers in order to guarantee the linearity in their nominal operation. The typical method to obtain the 1 dBc point is by using single-tone <b>excitation</b> <b>signals</b> to get the nonlinear amplitude to amplitude (AM-AM) characteristic but, as will be shown in the paper, in radiometers, {{the nature of the}} wide-band Gaussian-noise <b>excitation</b> <b>signals</b> makes the amplifiers present higher nonlinearity than when using single tone <b>excitation</b> <b>signals.</b> Therefore, in order to analyze the suitability of the LNA’s nominal operation, the 1 dBc point has to be obtained, but using realistic <b>excitation</b> <b>signals.</b> In this work, an analytical study of compression effects in amplifiers due to <b>excitation</b> <b>signals</b> composed of several tones is reported.

The oscillation of the cantilever changes upon interaction between the tip and the sample and is detected with a laser beam (2) focussed {{on the back of}} the cantilever. The reflected beam travels via mirrors to a position sensitive detector (PSD) (3). The signal of the PSD is amplified by a preamplifier.

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) offer frictionless suspension, vibration insulation, programmable stiffness, and damping, {{among other}} advantages, in levitated rotor applications. However, AMBs are inherently unstable and require accurate system {{models for the}} high-performance model-based multi-input multi-output control of rotor position.

50|$|The AC {{current in}} the {{electric}} coil generates eddy current {{on the surface of}} the material. According to theory of electromagnetic induction, the distribution of the eddy current is only at a very thin layer of the material, called skin depth. This depth reduces with the increase of AC frequency, the material conductivity, and permeability. Typically for 1 MHz AC excitation, the skin depth is only a fraction of a millimeter for primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum. The eddy current in the magnetic field experiences Lorentz force. In a microscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the electrons in the eddy current. In a macroscopic view, the Lorentz force is applied on the surface region of the material due to interaction between electrons and atoms. The distribution of Lorentz force is controlled by the design of magnet, and design of the electric coil, the properties of the test material, relative position between the transducer and the test part, and the <b>excitation</b> <b>signal</b> for the transducer.|$|E
