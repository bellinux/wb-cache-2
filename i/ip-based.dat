5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single <b>IP-based</b> network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E

According to deaf-community organizations Canada is lagging far behind its neighbour, the United States, with respect to video relay service for the deaf, hard-of-hearing and deaf-blind.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for {{development}} and implementation of an integrated and portable <b>IP-based</b> live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the U.S. Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various prosumer and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.|$|E
25|$|The hyper-competition in telecom market, {{which was}} {{effectively}} {{caused by the}} introduction of Universal Access Service (UAS) licence in 2003 became much tougher after 3G and 4G competitive auction. About 670,000 route-kilometer (419,000-mile) of optical fibres has been laid in India by the major operators, including in the financially nonviable rural areas and the process continues. Keeping in mind the viability of providing services in rural areas, the government of India also took a proactive role to promote the NGN implementation in the country; an expert committee called NGN eCO was constituted in order to deliberate on the licensing, interconnection and Quality of Service (QoS) issues related to NGN and it submitted its report on 24 August 2007. Telecom operators found the NGN model advantageous, but huge investment requirements have prompted them to adopt a multi-phase migration and they have already started the migration process to NGN with the implementation of <b>IP-based</b> core-network.|$|E

2500|$|This {{architecture}} {{attempts to}} define a systematic and extensible means by which network operators and law enforcement agents (LEAs) can interact, especially as networks grow in sophistication and scope of services. [...] Note this architecture applies to not only “traditional” wireline and wireless voice calls, but to <b>IP-based</b> services such as Voice over IP, email, instant messaging, etc. [...] The architecture is now applied worldwide (in some cases with slight variations in terminology), including in the United States {{in the context of}} CALEA conformance. [...] Three stages are called for in the architecture: ...|$|E
2500|$|As stated above, the ETSI {{architecture}} is equally applicable to <b>IP-based</b> services where IRI (or CD) {{is dependent on}} parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. [...] For example, {{in the case of}} email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). [...] Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). [...] Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.|$|E
2500|$|The call data (known as Intercept Related Information or IRI in Europe and Call Data or CD in the US) {{consists}} {{of information about}} the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), time of the call, duration, etc. [...] Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. [...] Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear down, scheduling, target identification, etc. [...] Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the Handover Interfaces (designated HI). [...] Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an <b>IP-based</b> VPN. [...] The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up {{at the time of the}} interception.|$|E
