50|$|The Government of Zanzibar {{has been}} more {{aggressive}} than its mainland counterpart in instituting economic reforms and has legalized foreign exchange bureaus on the islands. This has loosened up the economy and dramatically increased the availability of consumer commodities. Furthermore, with external funding, the government plans to make the port of Zanzibar a free port. Rehabilitation of current port facilities and plans to extend these facilities will be the precursor to the free port.

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} {{framework}} in which small countries can assess the proper role for {{the state and the}} private sector in pension policy. Based on industrial organization theory and pension economics, this framework draws on experience in small countries. The authors identify how optimal pension policies can change in small countries (those with fewer than 1 million active contributors to pension funds), explore optimal pension reform design for small countries, and incorporate other stylized assumptions about small countries into the discussion: the relatively greater international mobility of labor and capital, the greater scarcity of human capital specialized in financial supervision and tax administration, fewer independent interests, and higher political volatility and risk over long time horizons. They conclude that: 1) For small countries the Chilean model should be modified to include greater reliance on international trade in <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> [...] especially services that benefit from economies of scale and scope, such as collections, account processing, and benefit payments. Such an approach would require a greater harmonization of accounting and regulatory standards between small developing countries and the countries from which <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> are <b>imported.</b> 2) The unbundling of pension services is more advantageous in small than in large countries. 3) The collection of contributions and the payment of benefits (which are subject to substantial economies of scale for small countries) should be mandatorily unbundled from other pension services. 4) Those services should be provided separately to ensure competition in the selection of trustees and competitive investment management services. This type of pension system design may be preferable to having a foreign firm provide all pension services. 5) When other assumptions (such as susceptibility to large gross migration flows) are combined with the assumption of a small-country base, mandatory pension systems or fiscal incentives are found to be less effective in small than in large countries. Large countries have broader contribution bases and much smaller gross migration flows, making them demographically more stable. 6) The relatively greater international migration in small countries makes full funding of pension systems even more important in small than in large countries.

40|$|The recent {{media and}} {{political}} attention on service outsourcing from developed {{to developing countries}} {{gives the impression that}} outsourcing is exploding. As a result, workers in industrial countries are anxious about job losses. This paper aims to establish what are the hypes and what are the facts. The results show that although service outsourcing has been steadily increasing it is still very low, and that in the United States and many other industrial countries "insourcing" is greater than outsourcing. Using the United Kingdom as a case study, we find that job growth at a sectoral level is not negatively related to service outsourcing.

40|$|Several {{developments}} {{in international trade}} in services impact strongly on developing countries: First, the world-wide diffusion of information technologies (IT) has created new export opportunities for developing countries in IT services. Second, the recently proclaimed Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction can only be attained if key services are provided more efficiently in developing countries - particularly through the liberalization of <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> Third, in the ongoing Doha Development Round (DR) of trade negotiations, developing countries are asked to formally commit to liberalizing their <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> {{under the terms of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Developing countries will benefit from liberalizing <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> if liberalization enhances competition on the supply side. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> and telecommunications. The lifting of restrictions on the market access by foreigners (including through direct investment) will often improve service quality or lower prices and thereby enhance the international competitiveness of downstream industries. In Doha Development Round negotiations, therefore, developing countries may find it useful to commit to liberalizing <b>imports</b> of producer <b>services.</b> By contrast, the benefits of import liberalization are less clear for some consumer services where supply is subject to network monopolies (e. g., water and energy distribution) or demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). Here, achieving a socially optimal level of supply may require carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor support. For developing countries, such sectors should not be priority areas for commitments on <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> under the GATS. Most service exports by developing countries, especially IT services transmitted electronically, face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports may also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons, e. g., developing country nationals working in industrialized countries without becoming residents there. If Doha Development Round negotiations were to increase opportunities for such temporary labor migration, the benefits to developing countries could be huge. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the determinants of}} the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania with respect to the role of household behavioural factors. This is achieved by attempting three interrelated research questions: i) What are the financial experiences of households in Tanzania? ii) What are beliefs held by households in Tanzania about the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> iii) What are the effects of household behavioural characteristics for intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and subsequent usage of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed to achieve the research objective. The empirical findings suggest that behavioural factors matter for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Firstly, the examination of household financial experiences on a sample of 30 households through the application of financial diary methodology revealed a variety of household financial experiences that highlight the necessity of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to households. Secondly, despite the fact that most households do not use <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> it is found that households hold positive beliefs about <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> for saving facilities, security, finance, money management and improving economic well-being. Thirdly, structural equations models indicate that attitudes towards <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> perceived behavioural control and subjective norms significantly impact the intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived behavioural control is observed to prominently influence the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> The study offers the following contributions: Firstly, it develops a behavioural conceptual framework that integrates financial and psychological perspectives. This framework facilitates a broader understanding of the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> from various perspectives. Secondly, it provides distinct insights into the influence of behavioural characteristics in the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> This adds to the limited empirical literature about the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> specifically the effects of behavioural factors.
