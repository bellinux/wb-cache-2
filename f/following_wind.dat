25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It {{is also clear that}} Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they {{would have been able to}} travel on more days with a <b>following</b> <b>wind</b> which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E
25|$|Next up for Powell was the Diamond League Athletissima in Lausanne on 30 June. In chilly conditions, {{not ideal}} for sprinting, the former world record holder bulleted {{out of his}} blocks {{and ran to the}} tape, {{recording}} a world-leading 9.78s with a <b>following</b> <b>wind</b> of 1.0m/s. Powell was indeed happy with his strong performance, his fastest in three years and was full of confidence {{about the rest of the}} season and the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea in late August. Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July. He became the first man in history to break the 10 seconds barrier in the Sir Alexander Stadium when he clocked a very easy looking 9.95s in his heat. Later, in the final he eased to a 9.91s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He ran 9.90s in his heats and eased through the final to win in 9.86s, having following winds of 1.8m/s and 2.0m/s respectively, in cold conditions.|$|E
500|$|The funnels {{proved to}} be too short in service and they were raised about [...] four years after {{completion}} to keep the superstructure free of smoke in a <b>following</b> <b>wind.</b> In March 1916, both ships had all their six-inch guns removed, the embrasures plated over, and six of the guns were remounted on the upper deck.

500|$|Chambers {{was named}} in the British squad for the 2012 London Olympics after the {{selectors}} took into account his trials win and his times from the previous year. Given the abrupt turnaround in his fortunes, he said: [...] "For me representing my country in an Olympics is a privilege that should never be taken for granted. To {{be given the opportunity}} to do so in my home town has been a dream that at times has seemed very distant and is now a reality." [...] He returned to the British relay team at the 2012 European Athletics Championships after a six-year absence but a botched baton change saw the team disqualified. At the Olympics he won his 100 metres heat in a season's best of 10.02seconds, with a legal 2.0m/s <b>following</b> <b>wind,</b> in his first Olympic race in twelve years. He was drawn in the same semi-final as Usain Bolt but Chambers' run of 10.05 seconds for fourth meant he did not make the final. His Olympics came to an end in the 4×100 metres relay heats as the British team made an illegal baton exchange.|$|E

500|$|Land {{transport}} of military supplies on the cursus publicus (imperial transport service) was typically by wagons (angariae), {{with a maximum}} legal load of 1,500lbs (680kg), drawn by two pairs of oxen. The payload capacity of most Roman freighter-ships of the period was {{in the range of}} 10,000–20,000 modii (70–140 tonnes) although many of the grain freighters supplying Rome were much larger up 350 tonnes and a few giants which could load 1200 like the Isis which Lucian saw in Athens circa 180 A.D. Thus, a vessel of median capacity of 100 tonnes, with a 20-man crew, could carry the same load as c. 150 wagons (which required 150 drivers and 600 oxen, plus pay for the former and fodder for the animals). A merchant ship would also, with a favourable wind, typically travel three times faster than the typical [...] achieved by the wagons and for as long as there was daylight, whereas oxen could only haul for at most 5 hours per day. Thus freighters could easily cover [...] per day, compared to c. [...] by the wagons. Against this must be set the fact that most freighters of this capacity were propelled by square sails only (and no oars). They could only progress if there was a <b>following</b> <b>wind,</b> and could spend many days in port waiting for one. (However, smaller coastal and fluvial freighters called actuariae combined oars with sail and had more flexibility). Maritime transport was also completely suspended for at least four months in the winter (as stormy weather made it too hazardous) and even {{during the rest of the}} year, shipwrecks were common. Nevertheless, the surviving shipping-rates show that it was cheaper to transport a cargo of grain by sea from Syria to Lusitania (i.e. the entire length of the Mediterranean – and a ways beyond – c. 5,000km) than just [...] overland.|$|E

2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry. The bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge of conventional design, with the deck supported by two main cables slung between two steel towers. In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above mean high water and are of hollow box construction. The deck is an orthotropic steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners <b>following</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind tunnel model was accidentally destroyed. The sections of the deck were built at Fairfield-Mabey in Chepstow, and each 132tonne section was then floated down the river before being hoisted into position.|$|E

60|$|He {{caught the}} major {{by the arm}} and rushed him into the smoke, {{apparently}} {{in the direction of the}} greatest mass of flame. The heat was suffocating, but it struck the major that the more they approached the actual scene of conflagration the heat and smoke became less, until he saw that the fire was retreating before them and the <b>following</b> <b>wind.</b> In a few moments their haven of safety--the expanse already burnt over--came in sight.

Wulf preferred working to lying still, for as the craft rolled the water washed over them, while the din of the waves striking the ship's side, and the cataracts of spray falling on to the canvas above were deafening, and it was impossible to get a moment's sleep. All were glad when morning broke, although the scene that met their eyes was the reverse of comforting.

60|$|To Herodotus of Halicarnassus, greeting.--Concerning {{the matters}} {{set forth in}} your histories, and the tales you tell about both Greeks and barbarians, whether they be true, or whether they be false, men dispute not little but a great deal. Wherefore I, being {{concerned}} to know the verity, did set forth to make search in every manner, and came in my quest even unto {{the ends of the}} earth. For there is an island of the Cimmerians beyond the Straits of Heracles, some three days' voyage to a ship that hath a fair <b>following</b> <b>wind</b> in her sails; and there it is said that men know many things from of old: thither, then, I came in my inquiry. Now, the island is not small, but large, greater than the whole of Hellas; and they call it Britain. In that island the east wind blows for ten parts of the year, and the people know not how to cover themselves from the cold. But for the other two months of the year the sun shines fiercely, so that some of them die thereof, and others die of the frozen mixed drinks; for they have ice even in the summer, and this ice they put to their liquor. Through the whole of this island, from the west even to the east, there flows a river called Thames: a great river and a laborious, but not to be likened to the River of Egypt.|$|E
