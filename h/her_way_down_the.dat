5|$|After {{returning}} to New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia and back before she worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began {{the first of two}} African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After {{returning to}} the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia on 28 April.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
25|$|Decatur {{transferred}} back to United States by June 1800; {{with extra}} guns and sails and improved structure the refurbished ship made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River. Aboard ship {{at this time}} were Decatur's former classmates Lieutenant Charles Stewart and Midshipman Richard Somers, along with Lieutenant James Barron.|$|E

60|$|Philippa {{pushed open}} the windows and made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> towards <b>the</b> beach. She leaned over the rail of the {{promenade}} and waved her hand to the others, who clambered up the shingle to meet her.|$|R
6000|$|... "And my John can see 'im {{as far as}} Chelwood," [...] {{she thought}} {{to herself as she}} finally closed the door on the {{stranger}} and made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> creaking stairs.|$|R
25|$|In 1934 the new liner was {{launched}} by Queen Mary as RMS Queen Mary. On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slipway, Queen Mary was slowed by eighteen drag chains, which checked the liner's progress into the River Clyde, {{a portion of}} which had been widened to accommodate the launch.|$|E
25|$|Like {{her sister}} ships Pennsylvania and Ohio, Illinois {{also had an}} eventful first year of operation. In April 1874, she was making <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River when, just {{opposite}} the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she encountered four canal boats coming in the opposite direction. Illinois promptly collided with and sank all four vessels in short order. Fortunately, no lives were lost, and the hull of Illinois was undamaged by the collisions, enabling her to continue the voyage to Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|Atratos {{maiden voyage}} began from Southampton on 17 January 1889. As {{well as her}} passengers, mails and a full cargo she carried in her strong room £120,000 in sovereigns, {{jewellery}} worth £2,000 and silver bars worth £400. She called at Carril, Vigo and Lisbon, and then crossed the Atlantic to South America. There she worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> east coast, calling at Pernambuco, Maceió, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Magdalena, Thames and Clyde joined the same South American route over the next 18 months, but after her maiden voyage Atrato was switched to join Orinoco on RMSP's Caribbean route. All five sisters had long and successful careers.|$|E
60|$|From Ironbridge, {{two days}} later, they sailed {{with a general}} cargo for Stourwich, the Seamew picking <b>her</b> <b>way</b> {{carefully}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river by moonlight, followed at an ever-increasing distance by a cork fender of abandoned aspect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{but that}} goes for nothing. She may {{possibly}} be a trader, on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> Guinea coast, but by the cut of her sails and the look of her hull, I {{have no doubt that}} she is a Frenchman." ...|$|R
60|$|He made no answer. She {{lifted her}} skirts a little, for the dew was {{becoming}} heavier, and made <b>her</b> graceful <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope {{and across the}} bridge to the postern gate. Arrived there, she looked round. David Thain had vanished back into the grove.|$|R
25|$|On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{yellow brick}} road, Dorothy attends a banquet {{held by a}} Munchkin man named Boq. The next day, Dorothy frees the Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted {{connections}} of the Tin Woodman, and meets the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages {{the three of them}} to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in silk gauze, the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E
500|$|The section {{begins with}} Gaga wearing the tentacle dress, {{performing}} [...] "Partynauseous" [...] and [...] "Paparazzi" [...] with some ambient and quiet music. As she makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> runways, her dancers bring the [...] "Monster Paw Chair" [...] {{and puts it}} on one of the small stages. There Gaga sings [...] "Do What U Want" [...] and near the end she reaches for the piano to perform [...] "Dope" [...] and an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way". A speech ensues, which is followed by [...] "Jewels n' Drugs", as Gaga disappears beneath the stage. A video interlude starts showing the singer dancing. Gaga rises from the stage, near the piano, wearing a black latex dress and green wig, to sing the chorus of [...] "Jewels n' Drugs".|$|E
500|$|By late May, UB-3 {{had made}} <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic to the Austro–Hungarian port of Cattaro, the {{base from which}} most boats of the Pola Flotilla {{actually}} operated. For her first patrol, UB-3 was loaded with ammunition for Turkish forces at İzmir, Turkey. Because of her limited range, UB-3 was towed by the light cruiser SMS Novara of the Austro-Hungarian Navy through the Straits of Otranto and cast off near the island of Kérkira. UB-3s planned route was south of the Ionian Islands, around the Peloponnese, through the Cyclades, north around Khios and Karaburun, and into the Gulf of İzmir. If all went well, UB-3 would have arrived at İzmir on 28 or 29 May with about half her fuel left. The Germans received a garbled radio message from UB-3 {{when she was about}} [...] from İzmir, but were unable to completely understand it. No trace of UB-3 has ever been found. UB-3 {{was the first of the}} UB I boats to be lost during the war.|$|E
60|$|There seemed {{little doubt}} in the Russian's mind, however, {{but that she}} had been {{captured}} by warriors from one of the several villages she would have been compelled to pass on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> sea. Well, he was at least rid of most of his human enemies.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{starts with}} a blue Audi R8 pulling over, playing her {{previous}} single, [...] "Elephant". Burke {{steps out of the}} car and walks towards a London Underground station. It is at this point where the song begins to play. During the first chorus, Burke makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> platform.|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} the hours seemed less wearisome; there was less {{hopelessness}} in the waiting; and at last, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Marguerite, closely veiled and followed by Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, who, {{in the guise of}} her lacquey, was carrying a number of impedimenta, found <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> pier.|$|R
2500|$|Ben-my-Chree {{underwent}} her speed {{trial on}} the River Clyde on Wednesday 8 and Friday 10 July 1908, having departed Barrow-in-Furness on Monday 6 July. A large party of Steam Packet Company directors had travelled to Ardrossan {{on board the}} Tynwald and joined the Ben-my-Chree at Greenock. Slipping her moorings, the Ben-my-Chree made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Clyde to a point a few miles above the Cumbrae Lighthouse, gathering full speed as she went. The speed trial was to take place between Cumbrae Lighthouse on a fixed run to Skull Martin Lightship, situated just below Copeland Island {{at the mouth of}} Belfast Lough and back to Cumbrae Lighthouse.|$|E
60|$|He looked up. Mademoiselle Flossie, {{pleased with}} his appearance, had paused on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Wulf rejoined his companions, and before nightfall the ship was far on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E
60|$|A fortnight's leave was given, {{for the men}} {{to visit}} their homes, and the money which they had gained in their trip was of great use to their friends in {{enabling}} them to repair the damages effected by the Danes. Not a man was absent at the appointed time, and the Dragon again made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
50|$|In December 1863, Emmeline made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to Concord, NC {{when the}} Federals took Kinston. She finally worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> coast and her home near Morehead City.|$|R
60|$|They put a {{mattress}} under the Arkansan. Virginia {{did not leave}} him until he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken face. Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that rose on every side, she was choosing <b>her</b> <b>way</b> swiftly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room to join her father and aunt in the carriage below.|$|R
60|$|She made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> car, {{followed}} by Bruce Carmyle's indignant, yet fascinated, gaze. Strange emotions were stirring in Mr. Carmyle's bosom.|$|E
60|$|Lady Torrington, a fussy little woman, her hostess of {{the night}} before, on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room stopped and shook hands with Lady Cynthia.|$|E
60|$|The anchor was hoisted and {{the sails}} set, {{and in a}} few minutes the sloop had left the island and was on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lake.|$|E
60|$|The Ambriz {{had left}} England on the 12th of September, and had touched at Madeira {{and at the}} various towns on <b>the</b> coast on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> and at <b>the</b> former place had {{received}} {{the news of the}} disaster to the naval expedition up the Prah.|$|R
50|$|Captain Peter Cameron left <b>the</b> <b>Downs</b> on 28 May 1818, {{bound for}} Bengal and Madras. On 14 September General Hewett {{arrived at the}} New Anchorage, Calcutta. As she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast, she reached Coninga on 30 December, and then Madras on 9 January 1819. Homeward bound, she reached Colombo on 28 February, Port Louis on 13 April, and St Helena on 30 June. She arrived at Long Reach on September.|$|R
60|$|She {{went upstairs}} to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their father's room, and was on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> again, when <b>the</b> sight of the {{storeroom}} door suggested a new thought to her. She went toward it, and left the children to go down by themselves.|$|R
60|$|Then {{with all}} the papers safely tied {{together}} and hidden {{in the folds of}} her corselet, she once more found <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> great staircase and terraces and into the beech wood where M. de Stainville awaited her.|$|E
60|$|With Faith, {{to decide}} was to act. She lost {{no time in}} {{carrying}} out the idea. As soon as she {{came home from school}} the next day she left the manse and made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Glen. Walter Blythe joined her as she passed the post office.|$|E
6000|$|... "In any event," [...] said Mrs. Conant, [...] "the girl {{must stay}} here to-night, for {{it would be}} cruel {{to ask her to}} find <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} in the dark. We will put her in the maid's room, Peter, and to-morrow we can {{decide what to do with}} her." ...|$|E
60|$|Marilla whisked {{into the}} kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and {{steadily}} she took <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> sere clover field over the log bridge and {{up through the}} spruce grove, lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep.|$|R
25|$|When {{the bodies}} {{had been laid}} out on the stone floor, Lassie, a {{crossbred}} collie owned by the pub owner, found <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> amongst <b>the</b> bodies, and she began to lick the face of one of the victims, Able Seaman John Cowan. She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone’s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|R
50|$|During this {{interview}} Vera recalls an event specifically showing her mother's love and protection for her children. She told about a time during her childhood {{where she was}} playing in the grass when a man approached her {{and asked her to}} help him find something. The two of them headed down towards a river and soon this stranger began removing Vera’s clothes and raping her. A mother's instinct warned Carolina that her daughter was in trouble, and soon she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> river, rescuing her daughter from this stranger.|$|R
