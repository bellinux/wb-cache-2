50|$|A {{piling rig}} is a {{construction}} machine for piling in <b>foundation</b> <b>engineering.</b> It is mainly applied to drill in sandy soil, clay, silty clay, etc. and widely used cast-in-place piles, diaphragm walls, foundation reinforcement and other foundation projects. Its rated power of engine is around 108-450 kW, output torque 60-400 kN•m, maximum pile diameter 1.5-4 m, maximum pile depth 60-90 m. It can meet construction requirement of kinds of <b>foundation</b> <b>engineering</b> projects. It generally applies hydraulic crawler chassis, automatic lift box-type mast, telescopic drill pipe, auto vertical adjustor, depth indicator, etc. Its operation applies hydraulic pilot control, load sensor, {{thus it is}} easy and comfortable to control. Main and auxiliary hoisting can meet different requirements in construction sites. The rig {{can be used on}} piling construction in dry (short screw), wet soil (rotary bucket) and rock (core drill) by equipping with drilling tool, and can be equipped with long screw drill, diaphragm wall grab, vibratory hammer, etc., to realize many functions. It is mainly used in <b>foundation</b> <b>engineering</b> of municipal construction, expressway, bridge, industrial and civil buildings, diaphragm wall, water conservancy project, Slope protection, etc.|$|E
