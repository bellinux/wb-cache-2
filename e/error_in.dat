The sample {{of the study was}} 723 sentences made by 30 students of the second semester and 30 students of the sixth semester students in academic year 2013 / 2014 that were taken by cluster random sampling technique. The sentences were 337 (46. 61 %) simple sentences, 83 (11. 48 %) compound sentences, 218 (30. 15 %) complex sentences, 85 (11. 76 %) compound complex sentences. The data were collected by using two kinds of instruments namely: writing test to find the students’ grammatical errors and questionnaire to find the solution to prevent or minimize errors. Data on the students’ errors were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. The results of the study showed that the students made 832 errors classified into 13 types of errors which consisted of 140 (16. 82 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> production of verb, 110 (13. 22 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> preposition, 106 (12, 74 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> distribution of verb, 98 (11. 77 %) miscellaneous errors, 82 (9. 85 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> missing subject, 67 (8. 05 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> part of speech, 61 (7, 33 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> irregular verbs, 58 (6. 97 %) other <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> verb groups, 52 (6. 25 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> the use of article, 24 (2. 88 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> gerund, 18 (2. 16 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> infinitive, 11 (1. 32 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> pronoun/case, and 5 (0. 6 %) <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> questions. The top six frequent grammatical errors made by the students were production of verb group, preposition, distribution of verb group, miscellaneous error, missing subject, and part of speech.

In conducting this study, the writer gave a test to the first year students of SMAK St. Louis I Surabaya. Class I 1 was as the try-out group while class I 2, I 3 and I 4 were as the sample group. From the students' test papers, the writer got the data needed. Then, the errors made by the students were noted down, classified in two ways. One according to the types and the other according to the modal auxiliaries discussed in this study. After being classified, the <b>errors</b> were put <b>in</b> a rank order. According to the types, the errors that the students made were classified into ignorance of rule restrictions and false concepts hypothesised.
