Following an introduction reminding the need for {{easy to use and}} more consistent interfaces across our many day to day devices, this paper makes the case for using wearable computers to enhance the interactions between humans and conventional appliances.

As social and environmental concerns are growing in importance through normative and coercive directions, all the regional actors (triple/quadruple/quintuple helix) that supply chains interact with need to bridge their inter-organizational interfaces to properly ensure co-creation at the entire stakeholder level towards increasing the chances of a homogenous implementation of RGSCM. In this context, this paper adopts a three-stage mixed methodology of interviews, survey, focus groups, modelling and simulation case studies. The results show that the key pillars of inter-organizational interface integration and evolution reside in the proper identification of the key goals (performance indicators) of the involved institutions, which will maintain market-optimized competition levels. Then, institutions will steadily adhere to the market trends as explained by the ST and INT and in the process of adopting the RGSCM eco-innovation (DIT), the new entrant institutions will transform their inter-organizational interface to properly bridge with the core market stakeholder group. Finally, the key driver of <b>interface</b> <b>alteration</b> resides in the ability of disruptive (eco) innovators to set new standards. This research has core academic implications by extending the INT, DIT and ST under the context of RGSCM, policy implications in terms of proper policy making to support the required co-creation as well as practical implications by helping organizations to manage their inter-organizational interfaces...|$|E

40|$|Thin {{polycrystalline}} electroluminescent {{thin films}} (TFEL) of ZnS:Mn (phosphor) and Y 2 O 3 (insulator) were deposited individually or as multilayers onto Si (100) substrates. Their crystallinity and the luminescent {{efficiency of the}} phosphor films were investigated at varying thermal annealing temperatures. It is shown that the luminescent quality of the phosphor layer increases up to 700 °C, whereas the electroluminescence operating intensity of TFEL devices saturates at 500 °C. The structural analysis of the insulating and phosphor layers shows that they recrystallize at annealing temperatures of, respectively, 500 and 600 °C, and that their lattice misfit doubles at processing temperatures >= 500 °C. Since TFEL devices should benefit from enhanced luminescence efficiency and crystallinity at high annealing temperatures, we suggest {{that the lack of}} improvement in device performance beyond 500 °C is due to <b>interface</b> <b>alterations.</b> According to previous works, we propose that the lattice misfit increase between the phosphor and dielectric thin films modifies the morphology of the phosphor–insulator boundary inducing a modification of the interface states density, and hence, modifying high field electron transport properties of TFEL devices...|$|R

As indicated by the observed increase in E' defect density and alterations in ESR properties it appears that the copresence of the Si/SiO 2 structure affects the fumed SiO 2 (x) network structure distinctly, which is ascribed to the reaction of SiO released at the Si/SiO 2 interface.

This is an advancement of its application in monitoring dental implant stability. Studies of physical femur-implant models have used vibration to detect <b>interface</b> <b>alterations</b> that only represent gross changes at the interface in vivo. This study describes {{the development of a}} finite element (FE) model of the femur-implant system to simulate incremental interface changes during osseointegration. The model was used to validate experimental results and further investigate changes in the dynamic properties. A geometrical model of an amputated femur with an implant in the medullary canal was developed. A cylindrical interface region was created around the implant to simulate the volume of damaged bone due to implant insertion, which subsequently remodels. Appropriate material properties, boundary conditions, and finite element mesh parameters were applied. The dynamic properties of resonant frequency and mode shape were calculated computationally. These parameters were iteratively calculated as changes were made to the material properties of the interface region, simulating bone remodelling. The femur-implant resonant frequencies calculated when the interface properties were set to minimum and maximum values corresponded well with resonances found in experimental models of similar conditions and validated the use of the model. The FE model identified axial and torsional resonances that were not detected experimentally. The torsional resonance was the most sensitive to interfacial changes. The axial and torsional resonances were not found experimentally due to the selected experimental methodology. Therefore, the FE model provides additional information about the dynamic behaviour of the femur-implant system. As torsional resonance was the most sensitive to interfacial changes, amending the experimental methodology to enable its detection and expand the feasibility of vibration analysis for this application is a priority...|$|R

This is an advancement of its application in monitoring dental implant stability. Studies of physical femur-implant models have used vibration to detect <b>interface</b> <b>alterations</b> that only represent gross changes at the interface in vivo. This study describes {{the development of a}} series of physical models which simulate incremental interface changes during the progression of osseointegration and the investigation of vibration analysis in detecting the changing conditions. Models were developed to simulate the mechanical characteristics of the femur-implant interface during discrete stages of osseointegration. Forced excitation was applied to the models while their response was measured and used to calculate the dynamic properties of resonant frequency and mode shape. These parameters were compared to ascertain if they uniquely represented each stage. The six resonant frequencies changed depending on the modelled stage of osseointegration. All modes detected fibrous tissue formation. The second bending mode was consistently more sensitive to interface changes than bone mass changes. The first mode shape was similar across all models. In contrast, the second and third mode shapes revealed differences between the stages. The first bending mode was not detectable when the model boundary condition stiffness was decreased. The results indicate that the higher resonant frequencies may be more useful than the first frequency in detecting osseointegration progression. The insensitivity of the second resonant frequency to bone mass changes has important clinical implications; it is essential that in vivo measurements can only be attributed to remodelling at the interface. The mode shapes can be used in conjunction with the resonant frequencies to help identify changes at the interface. The findings demonstrate the potential of vibration analysis for this application and the technique warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 83 - 85. A {{computer}} {{technique is}} proposed {{for a simple}} practical method of automatically designing skeletal structures. Dynamic programming is used to find the optimum geometric configuration of the structural members, while the member sizes are proportioned by direct iteration. The computational effort required {{to find the best}} possible design for large structures can become unmanageable without the use of Dynamic Programming. This technique simplifies this problem by a process of intermediate decisions which are made at each stage of the solution. Dynamic Programming is applied to tower structures which can be regarded as discrete substructures. The configuration of each substructure is defined at its upper and lower interfaces by a set of state variables. An optimum weight design can be found by selecting the best configuration and hence the best state variables at each <b>interface.</b> Each <b>alteration</b> of the geometric configuration of a substructure effects its weight.

Lowering the sulfur contents of CVD NiAl bond coatings significantly improved scale adhesion, but localized scale spallation eventually initiated along coating grain boundaries.

Interestingly, the majority of this conserved surface contributes to the interaction with YfiB (Fig.  3 E and 3 F). Malone JG et al. have reported that F 151, E 163, I 169 and Q 187, located near the C-terminus of YfiR, comprise a putative YfiN binding site (Malone et al., 2012). Interestingly, these residues are part of the conserved surface of YfiR (Fig.  3 G). F 151, E 163 and I 169 form a hydrophobic core while, Q 187 is located {{at the end of the}} α 6 helix. E 163 and I 169 are YfiB-interacting residues of YfiR, in which E 163 forms a hydrogen bond with R 96 of YfiB (Fig.  3 D-II) and I 169 is involved in forming the L 166 /I 169 /V 176 /P 178 /L 181 hydrophobic core for anchoring F 57 of YfiB (Fig.  3 D-I(ii)).

The Tyr(out) 10 conformer forms a pi-cation interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg 21. As in other similar glutathione-S-transferases, the catalytic Tyr has a low pK(a) of 7. 2. In order to investigate the catalytic role of Tyr 10, and the structural and functional roles of Arg 21, we carried out structural studies on two Arg 21. mutants (R 21 L and R 21 Q) and a Tyr 10 mutant, Y 10 F. Our crystallographic data for the two Arg 21 mutants indicate that only the Tyr(out) 10 conformation is populated, thereby excluding a role of Arg 21 in the stabilisation of the out conformation. However, Arg 21 was confirmed to be catalytically important and essential for the low pK(a) of Tyr 10. Upon comparison with structural data generated for reduced glutathione-bound and inhibitor-bound wild-type enzymes, it was observed that the orientations of Tyr 10 and Arg 35 are concerted and that, upon ligand binding, minor rearrangements occur within conserved residues in the active site loop. These rearrangements are coupled to quaternary rigid-body movements at the dimer <b>interface</b> and <b>alterations</b> in the localisation and structural order of the C-terminal domain.

Our study addressed this question by using two strategies: a chimeric receptor approach employed ErbB- 3, whose defective kinase domain {{was replaced by the}} respective part of EGFR. The implanted full-length kinase, unlike its subdomains, conferred dimerization and catalysis. The data infer that the kinase function of EGFR is restrained by the carboxyl tail; once grafted distally to the ectopic tail of ErbB- 3, the kinase domain acquires quasi-dimerization and activation. In an attempt to alternatively refold the cytoplasmic tail, our other approach employed kinase inhibitors. Biophysical measurements and covalent cross-linking analyses showed that inhibitors targeting the active conformation of EGFR, in contrast to a compound recognizing the inactive conformation, induce quasi-dimers {{in a manner similar to}} the chimeric ErbB- 3 molecule. Collectively, these observations unveil kinase domain-mediated quasi-dimers, which are regulated by an autoinhibitory carboxyl tail. On the basis of these observations, we propose that quasi-dimers precede formation of ligand-induced, fully active dimers, which are stabilized by both extracellular and intracellular receptor-receptor interactions. —Bublil, E.

Methods: Thirty-six eyes were studied (20 patients, mean age 68 ± 12. 3 years). All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, which comprised SD-OCT and Nidek F- 10 analysis with short-wavelength blue laser. Eyes were divided into four groups depending on the degree of VRI alteration observed with the swSLO and SD-OCT. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test.

When submerged, human keratinocytes were grown in 1. 2 mM calcium and serum-containing medium with vitamin C (50 µg per ml) for 9 d, total lipid content remained unchanged, but both glucosylceramide and ceramide content increased. Moreover, selected ceramide and glucosylceramide species: i. e., nonhydroxy ceramide 2 and both α- and ω-hydroxylated sphingolipids, increased preferentially [ceramide 4 (6 -hydroxy-acylceramide), ceramide 5 (α-hydroxyceramide), ceramide 6 (4 -hydroxy-α-hydroxyceramide), and ceramide 7 (6 -hydroxy-α-hydroxyceramide); and acylglucosylceramide, glucosylceramide-B, and glucosylceramide-D], whereas ceramide 1, ceramide 3, glucosylceramide-C, and sphingomyelin remained unchanged. Synthesis of the corresponding ceramide and glucosylceramide fractions was enhanced by vitamin C, attributable, in part, to increased ceramide synthase activity (over 2 -fold, p = 0. 01); both serine palmitoyltransferase and glucosylceramide synthase activities remained unaltered. Finally, increased vitamin C-stimulated sphingolipid production correlated with the presence of lamellar bodies with mature internal contents, an increase in covalently bound ω-hydroxyceramide, and the appearance of prominent, corneocyte-bound lipid envelopes, whereas cornified envelope formation was unchanged.

The spatial decoupling of the generation and detection stages in one and the other supperlattice enables the individualization of each phenomenon. We clearly verify experimentally the selection rules for the generation and detection processes, which translate into well-defined maxima at specific frequencies in the corresponding spectral responses. A thickness gradient {{in one of the}} superlattices adds a degree of freedom that permits the variation of the spectral detuning between the maxima in the generation and in the detection spectral responses. The zero-detuning case is investigated. In the analysis of both spectral responses, the full size of the sample is found to play a significant role. Thin (similar to 3 mu m) and thick (similar to 350 mu m) samples are compared. Backreflection of light at sample outer surfaces and inner <b>interfaces</b> induces important <b>alterations</b> to the spectral responses as well...|$|R
40|$|Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) {{play key}} roles in many {{physiological}} processes {{in both the}} periphery and central nervous system. In addition, RXRs form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors to exert their physiological effects. The nuclear receptor related 1 protein (NURR 1) is particularly interesting because of its role in promoting differentiation and survival of dopamine neurons. However, {{only a small number}} of RXR-heterodimer selective modulators are available, with limited chemical diversity. This work describes the synthesis, biochemical evaluation, and structural elucidation of a novel series of RXR ligands with strongly biased interactions with RXRα-NURR 1 heterodimers. Targeted modifications to the small molecule biaryl scaffold caused local RXRα side-chain disturbances and displacement of secondary structural elements upon ligand binding. This resulted in the repositioning of protein helices in the heterodimer <b>interface</b> of RXRα, <b>alterations</b> in homo- versus heterodimer formation, and modulation of activation function 2 (AF 2). The data provide a rationale for the design of RXR ligands consisting of a highly conserved hydrophilic region, strongly contributing to the ligand affinity, and a variable hydrophobic region, which efficiently probes the effects of structural changes at the level of the ligand on co-regulator recruitment or the RXRα-NURR 1 dimerization interface...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{with the}} {{surrounding}} environment is {{an essential element of}} ever day life. For individuals' with severe motor and communicative disabilities, single switch scanning is used as method to control their environment and communicate. Despite being very slow, it is often the only option for individuals who cannot use other <b>interfaces.</b> The <b>alteration</b> of timing parameters and scanning system configurations impacts the communication rate of those using single switch scanning. The ability to select and recommend an efficient configuration for an individual with a disability is essential. Predictive models could assist in the goal of achieving the best possible match between user and assistive technology device, but consideration of an individual's single switch scanning tendencies has not been included in communication rate prediction models. Modeling software developed as part of this research study utilizes scan settings, switch settings, error tendencies, error correction strategies, and the matrix configuration to calculate and predict a communication rate. Five participants with disabilities who use single switch scanning were recruited for this study. Participants were asked to transcribe sentences using an on-screen keyboard configured with settings used on their own communication devices. The participant's error types, frequencies, and correction methods were acquired as well as their text entry rate (TER) during sentence transcription. These individual tendencies and system configuration were used as baseline input parameters to a scanning model application that calculated a TER based upon those parameters. The scanning model was used with the participant's tendencies and at least three varied system configurations. Participants were asked to transcribe sentences with these three configurations The predicted TERs of the model were compared to the actual TERs observed during sentence transcription for accuracy. Results showed that prediction were 90 % accurate on average. Model TER predictions were less than one character per minute different from observed baseline TER for each participant. Average model predictions for configuration scenarios were less than one character per minute different from observed configuration TER...|$|R

This work focuses on the changes in procedures {{in the development of}} web applications and related technologies. The main goal was to describe the contemporary state of art of the development of web applications and the attainment of modernity. Constituent parts of this work describe the historical development of technologies for web applications, a comparison of suitability of previously common technologies for a modern web, and the introduction of new technologies including their use. The theoretical part of this thesis describes the historical development of web applications, technologies for user interface usable on web, and technologies for the server side of web applications. Greater emphasis was given to the user <b>interface</b> since their <b>alteration</b> is more noticeable than the server section. In practical part of this thesis, the modern web application for METES system is developed. The application is developed using a React JavaScript library and a Laravel PHP framework. An emphasis was given to the explanation of individual principles of modern development of web applications, a description of the used technologies and their integration. The source code of a designed application is freely available in the public depository and is available to be used for a basis of a new project...|$|R
30|$|Aside of {{the usage}} of glass {{substrates}} with an high contact angle, one can also counteract the coffee ring effect by tuning the ink composition, e.g., by adding high boiling point solvents [11, 31, 32] to decrease the evaporation rate. However, the evaporation behavior becomes very complex {{for these kinds of}} co-solvent/surfactant/particle substrate systems since they are considered as non-equilibrium processes [9]. Surfactants are mainly part of the polymer nanosphere suspensions because they are incorporated during the emulsion polymerization process (see surface tension measurement in Table  1, high surface tension indicates low amount of surfactants and vice versa [33]). It has been reported that the dissolved surfactants may absorb on the substrate and on the nanospheres {{as well as on the}} air/solution <b>interface</b> resulting in <b>alteration</b> of the initial contact angle and contact area of the sessile droplet. Surfactants also affect the pinning conditions of the three-phase contact line and all factors finally influence the deposit morphology [9, 33]. The co-solvent which we will add strongly influences the evaporation rate of the droplet which is considered one of the main factors for the ordering of the particles [34]. It was found that electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals forces play a minor role for ordering since the attractive capillary forces upon meniscus formation between solvent and nanospheres during evaporation dominate [9, 34].|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study [S. Das, J. H. Snoeijer and D. Lohse Phys. Rev. E 82 056310 (2010) ], we {{provided}} quantitative demonstration of the conjecture [W. A. Ducker Langmuir 25 8907 (2009) ] {{that the presence of}} impurities at the surface layer (or the air-water interface) of surface nanobubbles can substantially lower the gas-side contact angle and the Laplace pressure of the nanobubbles. Through an analytical model for any general air-water interface without nonideality effects, we showed that a large concentration of soluble impurities at the air-water interface of the nanobubbles ensures significantly small contact angles (matching well with the experimental results) and Laplace pressure (though large enough to forbid stability). In this paper this general model is extended to incorporate the effect of nonidealities at the air-water <b>interface</b> in impurity-induced <b>alteration</b> of surface nanobubble properties. Such nonideality effects arise from finite enthalpy or entropy of mixing or finite ionic interactions of the impurity molecules at the nanobubble air-water interface and ensure significant lowering of the nanobubble contact angle and Laplace pressure even at relatively small impurity coverage. In fact for impurity molecules that show enhanced tendency to get adsorbed at the nanobubble air-water interface from the bulk phase, impurity-induced lowering of the nanobubble contact angle is witnessed for extremely small bulk concentration. Surface nanobubble experiments being typically performed in an ultraclean environment, the bulk concentration of impurities is inevitably very small, and in this light the present calculations {{can be viewed as a}} satisfactory explanation of the conjecture that impurities, even in trace concentration, have significant impact on surface nanobubble...|$|R
40|$|Point {{mutations}} at the dimer interface of the homodimeric enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APx) {{were constructed}} {{to assess the}} role of quaternary interactions in the stability and activity of APx. Analysis of the APx crystal structure shows that Glu 112 forms a salt bridge with Lys 20 and Arg 24 of the opposing subunit near the axis of dyad symmetry between the subunits. Two point mutants, E 112 A and E 112 K, were made {{to determine the effects}} of a neutral (alanine) and repulsive (lysine) mutation on dimerization, stability, and activity. Gel filtration analysis indicated that the ratio of the monomer to dimer increased as the dimer interface interactions went from attractive to repulsive. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data exhibited a decrease in both the transition temperature (Tm) and enthalpy of unfolding (deltaHc) with Tm = 58. 3 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, 56. 0 +/- 0. 8 degrees C, and 53. 0 +/- 0. 9 degrees C and deltaHc = 245 +/- 29 kcal/mol, 199 +/- 38 kcal/mol, and 170 +/- 25 kcal/mol for wild-type APx, E 112 A, and E 112 K, respectively. Similar changes were observed based on thermal melting curves obtained by absorption spectroscopy. No change in enzyme activity was found for the E 112 A mutant, and only a 25 % drop in activity was observed for the E 112 K mutant which demonstrates that the non-Michaelis Menten kinetics of APx is not due to the APx oligomeric structure. The cryogenic crystal structures of the wild-type and mutant proteins show that mutation induced changes are limited to the dimer <b>interface</b> including an <b>alteration</b> in solvent structure...|$|R
