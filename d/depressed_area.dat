5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E

500|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} spore print ranging in color from pinkish brown to reddish brown. The spores measure 10–17 by 3.5–4.5μm, and are fusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped) to elliptical. [...] Spores have a smooth surface, and a plage (a <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> where the spore was once {{attached}} to the basidium via the sterigma). The spore walls are thin, up to 0.2μm. They are pale yellow to cream green in a solution of potassium hydroxide, pale yellow-rust in Melzer's reagent, and blue in Methyl blue; without stain, they appear hyaline to pale yellow. The cap cuticle is an interwoven trichodermium—a cellular arrangement whereby the hyphae are of roughly equal length and arranged perpendicularly to the surface. [...] The terminal (end) cells of the trichodermium are 6.5–11.5μm in diameter, and roughly equal in width throughout their length. They are encrusted with a crystalline substance, a feature that is uncommon in the Boletaceae. The hyphae of the tubes are 5.0–13.0μm in diameter. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
500|$|Boletus rubroflammeus {{produces}} an olive-brown spore print. The spores are smooth, roughly oblong to slightly [...] (swollen) in face view, in profile view inequilateral, and have dimensions of 10–14 by 4–5μm. Spores {{have a broad}} and shallow suprahilar depression (a <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> on the dorsal side of the spore that was once attached to the sterigma). They are yellowish hyaline (translucent) in Melzer's reagent, and pale yellow-orange when mounted in a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped with a long pedicel (stalk), four-spored, and measure 30–40 by 8–9μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the tube faces) are rare to scattered, 28–37 by 9–15μm, fusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped) to ventricose, and have a somewhat sharp tip. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges) are abundant, 18–35 by 5–9μm, and roughly similar in shape to the pleurocystidia. When mounted in KOH, the cheilocystidia have a dingy orange-yellow color, and walls that are smooth and thin. The tissue of the tubes is bilateral, meaning {{that they have a}} central strand of roughly parallel hyphae from which other hyphae diverge. The central strand comprises interwoven hyphae that are [...] and orange-yellow [...] in KOH; the diverging hyphae continue into the hymenium to form a subhymenium that contain smooth hyphae measuring 4–6μm wide. The cap has a cuticle consisting of tightly interwoven pressed-down hyphae that are usually 3–5μm wide. The hyphae in the epicuticular zone (a waxy layer {{on the surface of the}} cuticle) often have fine granular incrustations that can be seen in both KOH and Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of B.rubroflammeus.|$|E

In a slightly <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> {{just in front of the}} eyes are two small nipple-shaped structures (papillae) that are the nasal organs. The openings face to the rear of the fish and are closed by flaps attached to the walls closest to the fish's midline. The first pharyngobranchial gill arch is elongated and narrow with many tiny teeth. The smooth toadfish has tiny spines that are entirely within the skin layer; these run along its back from the nasal organs almost to the dorsal fin, and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine, and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent. The skin is smooth even when the fish is fully inflated. It swallows water or air via a flap in its throat to swell itself up.|$|E

2500|$|TVA was heralded by New Dealers and the New Deal Coalition {{not only}} as a {{successful}} economic development program for a <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> but also as a democratic nation-building effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director David Lilienthal. The TVA was controversial in the 1930s. Historian Thomas McCraw concludes (1971 p.157) that Roosevelt [...] "rescued the [...] industry from its own abuses" [...] but [...] "he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will". New Dealers hoped to build numerous other TVAs around the country but were defeated by Wendell Willkie and the Conservative coalition in Congress. The valley authority model did not replace the limited-purpose water programs of the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. State-centered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the New Deal era, when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate Congress and the administration.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{comparatively}} simple epigyne is that of Pirata montanus. It consists of a nearly plain plate, with the openings of the spermathacae near the posterior lateral corners. A somewhat more complicated form {{is illustrated by the}} epigyne of Trabeops aurantiacus. In this species, the plate is depressed or furrowed longitudinally, and the <b>depressed</b> <b>area</b> is divided by a ridge-like elevation, which divides the depression into two furrows or channels, each of which leads to the opening of the spermatheca of the corresponding side. This ridge-like elevation is called the guide, as its function [...] "seems clearly to be that of a guide to the male embolus, controlling the course of the latter and facilitating its entrance to the spermatheca." [...] In many cases the guide extends laterally on each side at its posterior end. This is true to a slight extent in the epigyne of Trabeops, but more markedly so in that of many species of Geolycosa, where the lateral expansions often conceal the openings of the spermathecae, as in the epigyne of Geolycosa pikei.|$|E
2500|$|The Baltic Sea, {{with its}} unique {{brackish}} water, {{is a result}} of meltwater from the Weichsel glaciation combining with saltwater from the North Sea when the straits between Sweden and Denmark opened. Initially, when the ice began melting about 10,300 BP, seawater filled the isostatically <b>depressed</b> <b>area,</b> a temporary marine incursion that geologists dub the Yoldia Sea. Then, as post-glacial isostatic rebound lifted the region about 9500 BP, the deepest basin of the Baltic became a freshwater lake, in palaeological contexts referred to as Ancylus Lake, which is identifiable in the freshwater fauna found in sediment cores. The lake was filled by glacial runoff, but as worldwide sea level continued rising, saltwater again breached the sill about 8000 BP, forming a marine Littorina Sea which was followed by another freshwater phase before the present brackish marine system was established. [...] "At its present state of development, the marine life of the Baltic Sea is less than about 4000 years old", Drs. Thulin and Andrushaitis remarked when reviewing these sequences in 2003.|$|E
