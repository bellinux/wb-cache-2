40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{evaluate}} the relationship between retinopathy and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 154 diabetic patients who had a history of diabetic disease were evaluated in two equal <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>77</b> patients with and without retinopathy, respectively.

CIMT of patients with retinopathy was significantly greater than patients without retinopathy (P < 0. 001). CIMT also correlated with age, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine.

25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>77</b> (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E

METHODS Through a prospective randomized clinical trial, a total of 154 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma were divided into two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>77</b> cases. Among the 154 cases, there were 134 squamous carcinomas, 17 adenocarcinomas and 3 adeno-squamous carcinomas. TNM staging: there were 17 in Stage, 76 in Stage and 61 in Stage. A dosage of 15 ~ 25 Gy IORT, energy 9 ~ 16 MeV electrons, was delivered to the tumors. The doses given were 40 ~ 60 Gy postoperation. RESULTS The local control rates in A and B groups were 49. 4 % and 62. 3 % respectively (P 0. 05). There were 16 deaths from radiotherapy complications, with 2 cases in group A and 14 in group B.

METHODS: We compared outcome and recanalization in men and women with basilar artery occlusion treated with antithrombotic treatment alone, IVT or combined IVT-IAT, or IAT in the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study. RESULTS: Overall, 389 male and 226 female patients were analyzed. In the antithrombotic treatment <b>group,</b> 68 <b>of</b> 111 (61 %) men and 47 of 70 (67 %) women had a poor outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0. 96; 95 % CI, 0. 75 to 1. 24), in the IVT/combined IVT-IAT <b>group,</b> 47 <b>of</b> <b>77</b> (61 %) men and 24 of 43 (56 %) women (aRR, 1. 19; 95 % CI, 0. 89 to 1. 60), and in the IAT <b>group,</b> 142 <b>of</b> 185 (<b>77</b> %) men and 71 of 102 (70 %) women (aRR, 1. 01; 95 % CI, 0. 88 to 1. 17). Mortality was not different {{between men and women}} in the antithrombotic treatment group (aRR, 0. 80; 95 % CI, 0. 55 to 1. 16), the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group (aRR, 1. 11; 95 % CI, 0. 72 to 1. 73), or in the IAT group (aRR, 1. 01; 95 % CI, 0. 75 to 1. 36). Insufficient recanalization after combined IVT-IAT or IAT was similar in men and women (23 % versus 22 %; aRR, 0. 92; 95 % CI, 0. 58 to 1. 46). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, no significant gender differences for outcome and recanalization were observed, regardless of treatment modality. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Visual neglect (VN) is {{a common}} {{consequence}} of right hemisphere (RH) stroke. The aims {{of this study were}} to explore the presence of VN after RH stroke in the patients with (T+) or without (T−) thrombolytic treatment, and to determine whether thrombolysis is a predictor of VN. The study <b>group</b> consisted <b>of</b> <b>77</b> [*]RH infarct patients. VN was evaluated with six conventional subtests of the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT). Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). In the neuropsychological examination, 22 % of all RH stroke patients had VN. VN was present in 15 % of the patients in the T+ group and in 28 % of the patients in the T− group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Despite that, patients in the T− group had a higher risk of VN than patients in the T+ group. Our results suggest that thrombolysis independently predicted absence of VN...|$|R
