5|$|Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (prisoner no. 84216) {{escaped from}} Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, {{the day of}} the Normandy landings. Hearing about the {{invasion}} of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where}} the trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E
5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E

5|$|In August 1996, a {{photographer}} and reporter {{from the paper}} were arrested by the United States Forest Service for trespassing {{at the site of}} a timber protest in a national forest. The Register-Guard responded by suing the Forest Service <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment freedom of the press. The criminal charges were later dropped and the civil suit was settled out of court.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about the American government as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E
5|$|Thuppakkis {{first look}} poster was leaked on the {{internet}} on 30 April 2012, a day prior to its scheduled release on 1 May. The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in his mouth, was criticised by social activists <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss explained {{that it was only}} for promotional purposes and added that the film had no such scenes, claiming that even a small sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E

5|$|Virdon's career {{managerial}} record, {{over all}} {{or parts of}} 13 seasons, was 995–921 (.519). He also managed {{in the minor leagues}} for the Cardinals and the Astros. In June 2012, the Pirates attempted to add Virdon and Mazeroski to their coaching staff, but were rebuffed by MLB <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> rules on uniformed coaching staffs after one game. Virdon continues to serve as a special outfield instructor for the Pirates during spring training.|$|E
5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers {{who fail to}} comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill. Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee {{at the end of the}} 2007 regular session.|$|E
5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> team's curfew. Maryland {{took a quick}} lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game. He {{had been one of the}} suspended players, but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins.|$|E

5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E

50|$|Collins was {{suspended}} the first 10 {{games of the}} 2017 season <b>for</b> again <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> NFL's policy on performing enhancing substances. This length of suspension was due to this being his second suspension for PED use.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} that the Riemann {{hypothesis}} is false, the argument is much simpler, essentially because the terms li(xρ) <b>for</b> zeros <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Riemann hypothesis (with real part greater than 1/2) are eventually larger than li(x1/2).|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act {{with regard}} to its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|Later in the morning, Ike {{picked up}} his rifle and {{revolver}} from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street where Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> ordinance. Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2016, Media General {{obtained}} a preliminary injunction against Gray <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> SSA and JSA, which required that Gray return control of WAGT to Media General, and forbade Gray from selling WAGT in the spectrum incentive auction. The company accused Gray {{of using the}} spectrum auction and sale of the station to exit the agreements illegitimately, as they were to last through 2020, and apply to any future owner of WAGT. Gray attempted to block the injunction by arguing that its actions were {{required in order to}} comply with the FCC's prohibition of joint sales agreements, but was denied. Media General took back control of WAGT on March 7, 2016.|$|E

5|$|The US federal {{government}} intervened, obtaining an injunction against the strike {{on the theory}} that the strikers had obstructed the US Mail, carried on Pullman cars, by refusing to show up for work. President Grover Cleveland, who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns, sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction. The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike. Overall, 30 strikers were killed in the strike, 13 of them in Chicago, and thousands were blacklisted. An estimated $80 million worth of property was damaged, and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> injunction and sent to federal prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Florida State's second {{possession}} of the game began at its 20-yard line. On first down, running back Greg Jones gained four yards. A second-down pass from Rix to Gardner gained 11 yards and the Seminoles' first first down of the game. They were unable to gain another first down, however, and punted {{for the second time in}} the game. During the return, Florida State was penalized five yards <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> halo rule that required two yards between the player catching the ball and the nearest defender. The rule has since been rescinded.|$|E
