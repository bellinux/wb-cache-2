2500|$|Before the 2001 season, Maryland hired a {{new head}} coach, Ralph Friedgen, who {{engineered}} a first-year turnaround for the program. During summer training camp, Gary took an awkward hit and suffered a cervical spine injury. He was evacuated to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, but fully recovered. Against sixth-ranked Georgia Tech, Gary made a critical 18-yard reception to the Yellow Jackets' 46-yard line with 40seconds left {{as part of}} a drive to push within field goal range. Nick Novak later kicked the tying field goal, and in overtime, kicked the game-winner. The win improved the Terps' record to 6–0 and secured bowl eligibility for Maryland {{for the first time since}} 1991. Against Virginia, Gary recorded five receptions for 99 yards and a 53-yard touchdown. In the penultimate regular season game, 13th-ranked Maryland played Clemson at Byrd Stadium. Gary recorded five receptions for 93yards and a touchdown, and the Terrapins won, 37–20, to ensure at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship with Florida State. The following week, Maryland played its last conference game against NC State. In the final minutes of regulation, with Maryland trailing, quarterback Shaun Hill mounted a 61-yard drive. It culminated with an eight-yard pass to Gary in the corner of the end zone to win the game, 23–19, with 41seconds remaining. The win secured the outright ACC championship. Throughout the season, Gary was quarterback Shaun Hill's preferred receiver, and led the balanced Maryland receiving corps. Gary recorded 49receptions, 727yards, and six touchdowns. He was the first Maryland player since Gary Collins in 1961 to lead the team in receptions in three consecutive seasons. Gary was named an All-ACC player, which made him the first Maryland receiver honored as such since 1995. About that championship-winning season, <b>Gary</b> <b>said</b> in 2009:"Every day, we were told we were nothing. Every day, we were told we were picked to finish seventh in the conference for a reason. Really, we don't have a lot of fond football memories. My [...] has a thick coat of dust on it." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gary</b> <b>said</b> to The Sun: [...] "When we'd {{finished}} that song, we were going, 'F*** me, {{this could}} be a big song'.

5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Todd Holland said Tyler Labine is [...] "an {{actor who}} is funny" [...] {{rather than a}} comedian. Labine needs to know the appropriate emotional response for his character. Frank Dolce, who plays 11-year-old <b>Gary,</b> <b>said</b> Gary is in charge because his 13-year-old brother just does what makes him feel good and goes along with what others want. His 8-year-old brother couldn't be in charge because he is [...] "anti-authority". Co-creator Tommy Dewey said having an 11-year-old in charge was [...] "more interesting".|$|E

5000|$|As he {{gathered}} parts for the unique automobiles he constructed {{when he was}} young, Jim <b>Gary</b> <b>said</b> he realized that these parts resembled anatomical structures of insects, large birds, reptiles, and especially the bones of dinosaurs. Early in his career, he began to construct sculptures of those animals by assembling the automobile parts into almost life-sized models. He used {{as many as eight}} to ten vehicles to create his large dinosaur sculptures [...] and the unaltered parts are identifiable. Common tools became pivotal structures in some of his sculptures. Volkswagens metamorphosed into turtles and prehistoric dinosaurs.|$|E

Dan [...] "scared the hell out of me" [...] whenever he could, <b>Gary</b> <b>said,</b> but Dan also nurtured Gary's love of scientific knowledge. They caught animals in Puget Sound and placed them in terrariums in the basement, and also made a small desert ecosystem.|$|E

Gary writes most of the lyrics, Gil does the music, and they both produce.

5000|$|Covering the {{conclusion}} of M*A*S*H for TV Guide in 1983, Burt Prelutsky wrote, [...] "Although nobody wanted to be quoted for the record, the feelings about Gary Burghoff's leaving were fairly unanimous: loved Radar, hated Burghoff. As summed up {{by one of the}} principals: 'Gary had personality problems. He always felt there was a conspiracy against him. He was rude to everyone, but if anyone ever said anything back to him, he'd throw a tantrum. He had frequent spats with his cast members, particularly with Alan Alda. Once Mike Farrell told him that his problem was that he could dish it out but he couldn't take it, and <b>Gary</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "And I'm getting real sick and tired of dishing it out." [...] The poor guy didn't even realize what he'd said.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Arthur, {{professor}} of {{politics at the}} University of Ulster, called him an [...] "astute thinker". British journalist Peter Taylor, who met McMichael, described him as having been [...] "articulate and tough", and his son by his first marriage, <b>Gary,</b> <b>said</b> of his father:"I think it was recognised {{that my father was}} no angel. He was a leader in a paramilitary organisation. Perhaps he'd been there and done that and bought the T-shirt. He was a well-respected person within the loyalist community and his credentials were extremely strong. People saw my father as someone who said that loyalism was at war with militant republicanism and he was unashamed about that. At that same time, he was also making a contribution to trying to push not just loyalism but everyone beyond conflict".|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, Gary was {{a member}} of the Houma branch of the federal Office of Price Administration. Over a five-year period, the [...] "ration board", as it was known, had {{regulated}} and stabilized prices on scarce consumer goods. The Houma OPA facility closed on November 4, 1946. <b>Gary</b> <b>said</b> that the board was [...] "proud of one thing: We always guided ourselves when issuing critical material on a high-priority basis. Much pressure was put on us, but as a member of the program I feel that we gave such material to the people entitled to it. We did the job as well as we possibly could." [...] Gary's sixteen years as mayor are remembered for the expansion of the Houma electrical and water systems and mineral development. Four-inch water pipes on Main Street were replaced by 8-inch pipes. Gary also worked to establish the first municipal auditorium, the Intracoastal Canal tunnel, the Houma Navigation Channel, and a natural gas lease which eliminated or reduced property taxes for most municipal residents.|$|E

A show like this needs to stay fresh and exciting, so it’s a great opportunity for someone to come in and take the show past its incredible ten year anniversary. [...] "Next year is a very busy year for me and X Factor is a full time job so it felt like the right time to hand over the baton." [...] An X Factor spokesperson added: [...] "As <b>Gary</b> <b>said</b> on the show tonight we can confirm that this will be his last series as a judge on The X Factor as next year he will be focusing on his own music. [...] "We'd like to thank him for an amazing contribution over the last three years." [...] Barlow was replaced by Simon Cowell.|$|E
