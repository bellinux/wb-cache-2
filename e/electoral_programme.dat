Following {{the victory of the}} Popular Front, which had included in its <b>electoral</b> <b>programme</b> a promise to dissolve the right-wing leagues, in the parliamentary elections of May 1936, the government issued a decree banning the Croix-de-Feu, along with the Mouvement social français, on 18 June.

40|$|Party programmes, {{frequently}} {{also called}} manifestos or platforms, are written documents {{in which a}} political party sets out the programme either for its general inter-party making or for broader pre- and/or post-election purposes. As such, the party programme is regarded as an important constitutive part of each democratic party ‘body’ or, even wider, the element of democratic election processes or even the democratic political system in general. Analysing party programmes also represents one of most visible theoretical and methodological research topics inside various political science disciplines. Based on such understandings of the roles of party programmes, the main aim {{of this article is}} to disclose the prevailing characteristics of those party programmes prepared or used for the purposes of Slovenian national parliamentary elections (e. g. <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes).</b> With this in mind, we expect to be able to give mainly a general descriptive assessment of the status and importance of party <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> in the case of a young post-socialist democratic state, actually the first of that kind in the Slovenian case. Accordingly, a comparative approach of analysing the outlook and content dimensions of party programmes is applied. The comparison is made from three different perspectives: a) party perspective that relates to the comparison of the programme content of the competing political parties, where their pre- and post-electoral parliamentary status is especially considered; b) time perspective relating to the comparison of the last two national parliamentary elections (2004 and 2008); c) coalition agreement perspective, according to which party <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> are compared to the contents of the crucial post-electoral document. The conclusions, on one hand, expose many similarities among the compared elements regardless of party status, as well as some major differences on the other hand. The latter relate mostly to the contextual dimensions of the programmes and enable us to classify <b>electoral</b> party <b>programmes</b> into four different types according to their prevailing characteristics...|$|R

The contents of the parties‟ <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> reflect their political and ideological importance {{and serve as a}} fundamental basis for understanding each parties place and positions concerning their project for developing the State. The importance of the parties‟ <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> is evident from what they reflect, or should reflect, in terms of their political concept of the State in national terms as well as, from a broader political perspective, in European and in international terms. The starting point for this research is the assumption that ideology is a fundamental political category, though its loss of impact and of social and political relevance in Western democratic States, at least since late sixties. This research analysis as a working corpus considers the programmes of the five most representative Portuguese political parties campaigning for the 2009 European Elections. This study is based upon applying content analysis technique to the programme contents of Portuguese political parties (political parties with national Parliamentary representation) for the 2009 European elections and it will focus upon ideology as a central category as well as upon several other key political concepts basic to the programmes being analysed.

40|$|In all {{political}} systems {{there is a}} gap between the rhetoric of <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> and the practical work of institutions, argues author Riccardo Perissich, but the ‘vision thing’ is often a necessary prerequisite to reaching difficult decisions. When it comes to European institutions, which include the member states acting collectively, the desirable vision – the goal of European unity – has always been there and is still very much alive. Also, the existence of a broadly defined political goal has often facilitated agreements that were in fact purely necessary. However, because we lack a pan-European constituency to debate it, the narrative about this goal has been translated into different languages and is all but common. In fact, we have never seriously tried to unify it. Indeed, Europeans stopped debating what is desirable a long time ago: they simply react to events...|$|R

The results are, whenever possible, graphically presented as line graphs, dendrograms and a galaxy. We find out that only in some countries manifestos clearly belong to one dominant type, and therefore only these countries make sense as aggregates of manifestos in comparative studies.

40|$|Electoral {{politics}} in the larger western democracies seems to be becoming increasingly ‘denationalised’: non-statewide political parties have grown in strength, and demands for decentralisation have led to major institutional changes in large unitary states in recent years. As a result, the conventional view of party politics as essentially taking place at the national level, between national parties, over national issues, appears increasingly inadequate. This article argues that party scholars need to {{look more closely at}} what we could call the ‘territorial dimension’ of electoral politics: the spatial and geographical aspects of party competition. This article presents a preliminary analysis of how centre-periphery tensions and institutional reforms affect the way statewide parties organise, focusing on the areas of elite recruitment, <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> and campaigning, and party behaviour in public office. It hypothesises a variety of patterns of party response, and provides some tentative evidence from Western European democracies, and in particular in Britain, Italy and Spain. This analysis shows that the internal workings of statewide political parties are a key variable in understanding the relationship between institutional reform and the ‘denationalisation’ of electoral politics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project which analyzed the commitments made by prime minister of Poland - Donald Tusk and his government in 2007 and 2008, and compares them with the content of articles published in “Rzeczpospolita” and “Gazeta Wyborcza” (the most opinion-forming newspapers in Poland) during the first 100 days as well as the first year of government. The author confronts two perspectives - classical, Schmittian sense of politics and the new one - post-politics (according to Z. Bauman, S. Žižek and J. Baudrillard). He proposes an aspectual definition of political communication which harmonize with the idea of the Fourth Estate. Finally author assumes that the key term in the present era of post-politics is an image.

40|$|The thesis {{inquires}} {{into the}} stances of italian political parties towards {{the issue of}} immigration in the years 2005 - 2009 with a particular concern {{for the role of}} the EU in this policy area. Using a theoretical clasification of Zincone the thesis analyses parties' documents, <b>electoral</b> <b>programmes</b> and newspaper articles in order to identify the main issues and approaches adopted by the italian parties during the selected time period. The thesis proves to some measure the hypothesis that right- wing parties adopt mainly functionalist, legalitarian and identitarian approaches to immigration, whilst left-wing parties adopt solidarist, human-rights based and multiculturalist approach. In the run of the selected time period there was an increasement in the security rhetorics even by left-wing parties, so a political competition for ownership of the security issue was observed. Also a hypothesis was partially proved that left-wing parties want the EU migration and asylum policy to have a wide impact, whilst the right-wing parties want mainly the EU to help the member-state with the fight against illegal immigration and with negotiating readmission agreements...|$|R
