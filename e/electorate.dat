5|$|By Spring 1588, Gebhard {{had run out}} of options. In 1583, he {{had refused}} the {{settlement}} offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part of the <b>Electorate</b> in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories of the <b>Electorate</b> he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as Gelenkenschmerz, or joint pain) prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his claim on the <b>Electorate</b> to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg. Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at Nijmegen that summer. Without them to defend his claim on the <b>Electorate,</b> Rheinberg, Gebhard's last outpost in the northern <b>Electorate,</b> fell to Parma's force in 1589.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Reform Act {{was passed}} by Parliament, {{widening}} the <b>electorate</b> across the country. The Isle of Bute's <b>electorate</b> rose to 300 and acquired a permanent Member of Parliament, still controlled by Bute. Cardiff saw a short-term drop in its <b>electorate</b> {{as a result of}} the act, and Bute benefited from the granting of the vote to many of his richer agricultural tenants. In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian, to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, a {{redistribution}} divided Whitlam's <b>electorate</b> of Werriwa in two, {{with his}} Cronulla home {{located in the}} new <b>electorate</b> of Hughes. Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither <b>electorate</b> had a high school at the time, and they attended school in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December 1582, a {{proclamation}} in {{his name}} established parity for Catholics and Calvinists in the <b>Electorate</b> of Cologne, causing a scandal in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, and after his marriage in February 1583, he sought to convert the <b>Electorate</b> into a dynastic dignity. For the next six years, his supporters fought those of the Catholic cathedral chapter {{for the right to}} hold the electorship and the archdiocese in the so-called Cologne War or Seneschal War. After brutal fighting, and the plundering of villages, cities, and abbeys throughout the <b>Electorate,</b> Gebhard surrendered his claim on the <b>electorate</b> and retired to Strasbourg.

When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the <b>Electorate</b> until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the <b>electorate,</b> raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the <b>electorate</b> from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the <b>electorate,</b> Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben was a Protestant canoness (meaning {{that she}} was a woman living in a {{religious}} community, but not bound by a perpetual vow) at a convent in Gerresheim, today a district of Düsseldorf. After 1579, she maintained a lengthy liaison with the Archbishop of Cologne, Gebhard of Waldburg-Trauchburg, Truchsess of Waldburg. In defense of her honor, two of her brothers convinced Gebhard to marry her, and Gebhard considered converting to Calvinism for her. Rumors spread throughout the <b>Electorate</b> of his possible conversion, and that he might refuse to relinquish his position. The <b>Electorate</b> had overcome similar problems. Hermann of Wied had converted to Protestantism and resigned in 1547. Salentin of Isenburg-Grenzau, Gebhard's immediate predecessor, had resigned upon his marriage. In December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion and extended equal religious rights to Protestants in the <b>Electorate.</b> In February, he married Agnes. At the end of March 1583, the Pope excommunicated him. The Cathedral chapter promptly elected a new archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria.|$|E
