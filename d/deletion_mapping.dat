50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>deletion</b> <b>mapping</b> involves crossing a strain {{which has a}} point mutation in a gene, with multiple strains who each carry a deletion in a different region of the same gene. Wherever recombination occurs between the two strains to produce a wild-type (+) gene (regardless of frequency), the point mutation cannot lie within {{the region of the}} deletion. If recombination cannot produce any wild-type genes, then it is reasonable to conclude that the point mutation and deletion are found within the same stretch of DNA.|$|E

Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, 14. doi: 10. 3389 /fpls. 2016. 02063 Bread wheat has a {{large and}} complex allohexaploid genome with low {{recombination}} level at chromosome centromeric and peri-centromeric regions. This significantly hampers ordering of markers, contigs of physical maps and sequence scaffolds and impedes obtaining of high-quality reference genome sequence. Here {{we report on the}} construction of high-density and high-resolution radiation hybrid (RH) map of chromosome 4 A supported by high-density chromosome <b>deletion</b> <b>map.</b> A total of 119 endosperm-based RH lines of two RH panels and 15 chromosome deletion bin lines were genotyped with 90 K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 2316 and 2695 markers were successfully mapped to the 4 A RH and <b>deletion</b> <b>maps,</b> respectively. The chromosome <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> was ordered in 19 bins and allowed precise identification of centromeric region and verification of the RH panel reliability. The 4 A-specific RH map comprises 1080 mapping bins and spans 6550. 9 cR with a resolution of 0. 13 Mb/cR. Significantly higher mapping resolution in the centromeric region was observed as compared to recombination maps.

50|$|In {{the case}} of an {{insertion}} or a <b>deletion,</b> <b>mapping</b> of the paired-end is consistent with the reference genome. But the read are disconcordant in apparent size. The apparent size is the distance of the BAC sequenced-ends mapped in the reference genome. If a BAC has an insert of length (l), a concordant mapping will show a fragment of size (l) in the reference genome. If the paired-ends are closer than distance (l), an insertion is suspected in the sampled DNA. A distance of (l< µ-3σ) {{can be used as a}} cut-off to detect an insertion, where µ is the mean length of the insert and σ is the standard deviation. In case of a deletion, the paired-ends are mapped further away in the reference genome compared to the expected distance (l> µ-3σ).|$|E

40|$|The murine albino-deletion complex {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Oak Ridge specific-locus test covers 6 - 11 cM of chromosome 7. This complex {{has proven to be a}} valuable resource for localizing traits to a small target region suitable for positional cloning. In this study, we mapped the endpoints of deletions in this complex using all of the available Mit simple-sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers. Concurrently, this mapping has determined the map order of nearly all of the SSLP markers, most of which were previously unresolved. The SSLP-based <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> was confirmed and genetic distances were determined using the European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross panel of nearly a thousand mice. The average SSLP marker resolution is 0. 3 - 0. 4 cM, comparable to the cloning capacity of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). The SSLP markers were then used to construct a genetically anchored YAC framework map that further confirms the <b>deletion</b> <b>map.</b> We find that the largest deleted region distal to Tyr is about two to three times larger than the largest proximal deleted region, and the original C 3 H/ 101 regions flanking the deletions (moved to an St 2 A c(ch) /c(ch) background) are smaller than anticipated, which we suggest may result from increased recombination rates immediately flanking the deleted regions...|$|R
40|$|Aberrant {{methylation}} of CpG {{islands and}} genomic deletion are two predominant mechanisms of gene inactivation in tumorigenesis, but {{the extent to}} which they interact is largely unknown. The lack of an integrated approach to study these mechanisms has limited the understanding of tumor genomes and cancer genes. Restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS; ref. 1) is useful for global analysis of aberrant methylation of CpG islands, but has not been amenable to alignment with <b>deletion</b> <b>maps</b> because the identity of most RLGS fragments is unknown. Here, we determined the nucleotide sequence and exact chromosomal position of RLGS fragments throughout the genome using the whole chromosome of origin of the fragments 2 and in silico restriction digestion of the human genome sequence. To study the interaction of these gene-inactivation mechanisms in primary brain tumors, we integrated RLGS-based methylation analysis with high-resolution <b>deletion</b> <b>maps</b> from microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH; ref. 3). Certain subsets of gene-associated CpG islands were preferentially affected by convergent methylation and deletion, including genes that exhibit tumor-suppressor activity, such as CISH 1 (encoding SOCS 1; ref. 4), as well as genes such as COE 3 that have been missed by traditional non-integrated approaches. Our results show that most aberrant methylation events are focal and independent of deletions, and the rare convergence of these mechanisms can pinpoint biallelic gene inactivation without the use of positional cloning...|$|R

The two clusters were located in the left arm of vegetative φ 80 (the tail specifying cluster being distal).

Similar <b>deletion</b> <b>mapping</b> assays identified a functional boundary at the 3 ' terminus of the gene. DNA sequence analysis confirms the prediction that this 3 ' region encodes the carboxyl terminus of the tk polypeptide. A recombinant cDNA clone complementary to genomic tk sequences was isolated.

40|$|Non-flagellate H 2 mutants were {{isolated}} from a phase- 2 stable strain, SJW 806 HI-gt- H 2 -enPn vh 2 -, a derivative of Salmonella typhimurium. By transductional crosses a <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> and a recombination {{map of the}} H 2 gene were made. There are three regions especially rich in nonflagellate mutational sites. By {{the use of the}} <b>deletion</b> <b>map,</b> mutational sites of 21 flagellar shape mutants were also determined. Most of them were located at two regions which coincide with two of the three regions rich in non-flagellate mutational sites. A gene, vh 2, is closely linked to the promoter side of the H 2 gene. Three-factor transductional crosses showed that the oh 2 gene was on the left of the H 2 gene in the present map. The H 2 gene forms part of an operon with the distal gene rhl which specifies the HI repressor. Thus, a polarity effect of the H 2 mutations on the expression of the rhl gene was examined by observing whether a wild-type HI allele introduced into the H 2 mutants was expressed or not. Many of the H 2 mutations were polar, and most of the strongly polar mutations were located in the left (promoter-proximal) half of the HZgene, while most of the mutations in the right half of the gene were weakly polar or non-polar...|$|R

Six families {{in which the}} disorder followed an X-linked inheritance were investigated by linkage analysis. Diagnostic criteria were uniformly applied and included tests for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Close linkage was found by using the hypervariable repeated sequence CRI-S 232 (DXS 278) previously mapped to Xp 22. 3. At a maximum lod score of 6. 5, the recombination fraction was calculated as. 03.

Upon subculturing in liquid media of fully virulent isolates of Shigella flexneri 2 a YSH 6000, which contains only a 230 -kilobase-pair (kbp) plasmid in addition to 3. 3 - and 4. 2 -kbp cryptic plasmids characteristic to all S. flexneri strains, loss of invasiveness, loss of Congo red binding activity (Pcr), and complete loss of, or a deletion, or even a single-site IS insertion in the plasmid occurred simultaneously. This was ascribed to the fact that, once a noninvasive Pcr- cell has emerged, it overgrows the wild type as a consequence of its selective advantage in artificial media. A <b>deletion</b> <b>map</b> of the 230 -kbp plasmid was made by analyzing SalI digests of 39 deletion derivatives plus 1 formed by insertion of an IS 1 -like element in independently isolated, noninvasive Pcr- mutants.
