5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be in mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus.

5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante natal care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be willing to establish such a clinic, which would be open one day a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial by}} ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, to see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> float) {{appears to have}} been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood. It was {{believed}} that, as water was considered pure, it would reject witches, causing them to float, whereas the innocent would sink.|$|E

5|$|After {{her high}} school graduation, she planned to attend Alcorn State University, which {{did not have a}} women's {{basketball}} team. However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before Title IX, so there were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating {{one year}} of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, {{to give him a}} chance to redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved and asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ever {{get the chance to}} work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E

Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after moving}} in, Eddy became close to another student, Daniel Spofford. He was 33 {{years old and}} married when he joined her class; he later left {{his wife in the}} hope that he might marry Eddy, but his {{feelings}} were not reciprocated. Spofford and seven other students agreed to form an association that would pay Eddy a certain amount a week <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> preach to them every Sunday. They called themselves the Christian Scientists' Association.|$|E

In the Ananda Ramayana, both Trijata and Sarama journey to Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana. Later, when Sita visits Lanka, she tells Sarama to treat Trijata as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> her. The Kakawin Ramayana mentions how Trijata is honoured with rich gifts by Sita at Ayodhya as her loyal companion and solace, {{and the one who}} saved her life twice.|$|E

During her term as a federal MP, she similarly declined her pension as a provincial MLA.|$|R

5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E

The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not bring suit against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be able to do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|She {{then took}} up {{wheelchair}} basketball, playing for GRBK Gothenburg in the Swedish league, but Sweden had no national women's team. She spent two semesters studying German in Insbruck, {{but there was}} no wheelchair basketball team there, and she began playing for USC Munich, initially for their second team. There, she caught the attention of Holger Glinicki, the coach of the German national team, who asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to play for the German national team. She took German citizenship, a relatively painless procedure for an athlete, and made the German national team, which went on to win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48-42.|$|E
5|$|When the British largely {{abandoned}} Carleton Island in 1783, Brant {{moved to}} Cataraqui, now Kingston, Ontario. There the British government built her {{a house and}} gave her an annual pension of £100. She was assigned Farm Lot A in Kingston Township, along the northern limit of the town. It was 116 acres, instead of the standard 200 acres, because it was encroached upon by the Clergy Reserve. In addition, Brant and her family received compensation from the British government for their losses in the American Revolution. Hoping {{to make use of}} her influence, the United States offered Brant compensation <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return with her family to the Mohawk Valley, but she refused.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen Rasoherina (1863–68) the {{opportunity}} to rule, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony (1864–95), who {{would go on to}} marry Queen Ranavalona II (1868–83) and Queen Ranavalona III (1883–97) in succession. Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city. In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.|$|E
