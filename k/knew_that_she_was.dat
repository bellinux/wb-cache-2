At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lays dying, she infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.|$|E
25|$|According to Judge John G. Koeltl, in denying Stewart's {{motion to}} reject the verdict as unfounded, A {{rational}} jury could have inferred that, by relaying a statement withdrawing support for a cessation of violence by an influential, pro-violence leader of a terrorist group, Stewart <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> providing support to those within the IG (Islamic Group) who sought to return to violence—who the jury could have found were participants in the Count Two conspiracy, particularly Taha.|$|E

She bore him a daughter, who later married Liu Shan and became known as Empress Jing'ai of the state of Shu.

25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land {{on the floor as}} corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, Lucas and Keith {{return to}} Tree Hill after Dan {{has a heart}} attack. Lucas tries {{to make up for}} his {{behavior}} with Peyton and Brooke and becomes friends with both of them. He also starts seeing a new girl named Anna Taggaro, but they break up amicably when Anna accepts that she is a lesbian. Lucas realizes that he has romantic feelings for Brooke and begins to focus on building on a relationship with her, even though she is seeing Anna's brother Felix. Lucas discovers that he has inherited Dan's heart condition, but does not tell anyone except Dan. After discovering that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to break Keith's heart, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan if he leaves Keith alone and pays for Lucas's heart medication. This sets Lucas at odds with his mother, as she cannot believe that Lucas would want to live with Dan rather than her. It also causes a new rift between Lucas and Nathan, as Nathan feels that Lucas is replacing him and is bitter about Haley's departure to go on tour singing. Lucas and Karen are reconciled when she learns half of the reason he is staying with Dan, which is to protect Keith. This plan to protect his uncle fails when Jules leaves Keith at the altar and Keith leaves town after discovering that Lucas and Karen <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> hired by Dan. Lucas discovers Deb's painkiller addiction and decides to avenge all of Dan's victims. He finds a stash of cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic at Dan's dealership and plans to expose Dan's illegal dealings, but ultimately fails as Dan has also incriminated Deb. Dan then reveals that the whole thing was a set-up to test Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed. As a result, he loses Dan's college fund for him (which Dan had been saving since Lucas was a baby) and even his heart medication. Nathan also ends his friendship with Lucas after discovering that Lucas had planned to bring Dan down and visited Haley behind his back in an attempt to patch up her and Nathan's marriage. Lucas does, however, kiss Brooke in the season finale and confesses that he wants to be with her, but she still leaves for California to spend the summer with her parents. Ultimately, it is just Lucas and a broken-hearted Peyton (after boyfriend Jake left her) for the summer and the last shot is {{of the two of them}} sharing a meaningful hug on the beach.|$|E

It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer.

'Ã'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' I said to her 'You poor soul, what is to happen to you?' She said:"I must be killed." [...] "Why?" [...] I asked her. [...] "For something I did," [...] she answered. She went away and was beheaded.

500|$|The video {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from the journalist and critics. Jamie Portman from The Daily Gazette felt that the clip could be [...] "vulnerable to charges of being blatantly provocative in its calculated blending of sex and religion". David Rosenthal from The Spokesman-Review found the video as [...] "visually stunning"; however, Edna Gundersen from USA Today {{did not understand the}} media mayhem behind the clip. She pointed out that [...] "Madonna is a good girl in the video. She saves someone. What is the big deal?..." [...] Among music critics, Phil Kloer from Record-Journal felt that whether one condemns the video as racist or not, [...] "It's condemnable {{on the face of it}} because it exploits a symbol of evil [...] in order to sell records." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip. Taraborrelli described his thoughts: [...] "Madonna danced with such abundance in , as if she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about to cause a commotion, and couldn't wait to see how it would unfold." ...|$|E

500|$|Manning {{supplemented}} {{her book}} writing by reviewing for The Spectator, The Sunday Times, The Observer, Punch and others, {{as well as}} making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post. Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling {{that she did not}} get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. However, she consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her [...] "the world's worst grumbler", and the publisher remembered that she was [...] "never an easy author to handle." [...] A friend gave her the nickname [...] "Olivia Moaning", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance.|$|E
500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> it", said Romanek.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

It wasn’t one-note all the time, {{it was a lot of}} different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
