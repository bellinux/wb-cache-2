Christy was distraught at {{the outcome of the}} 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing. When he encountered Teller, who had testified against Oppenheimer, at Los Alamos in 1954, Christy publicly refused to shake Teller's hand. [...] "I viewed Oppenheimer as a god", he later recalled, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that he was not a treasonable person."

500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect."

500|$|The {{portions}} of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity or prehistory.

[...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> I could be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E

500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E

2500|$|During the album's production, Vaughan {{appeared}} at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the US national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner"; his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage, Vaughan acquired an autograph from Mickey Mantle, who was a former player for the New York Yankees. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press: [...] "As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid {{enough to know that}} he wanted Mickey Mantle's autograph. Mantle obliged. 'I never signed a guitar before.' Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> he'd be dead before he hit 30." [...] Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrix's rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison: [...] "I heard they even wrote about it in one of the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. I hate that stuff. His version was great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Georgiou {{began to}} perform his songs in London coffee houses and pubs. At first he tried forming a band, but soon {{realised}} he preferred performing solo. Thinking that his given name {{might not be}} memorable to prospective fans, he chose the stage name Cat Stevens, in part because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but mainly because he said, [...] "I couldn't imagine anyone going to the record store and asking for 'that Steven Demetre Georgiou album'. And in England, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> in America, they loved animals." [...] In 1966, at age 18, he impressed manager/producer Mike Hurst, formerly of British vocal group the Springfields, with his songs and Hurst arranged for him to record a demo and then helped him get a record deal. The first singles were hits. [...] "I Love My Dog", charting on the UK Singles Chart at number 28, and [...] "Matthew and Son", the title song from his debut album, went to number 2 in the UK. [...] "I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun" [...] was his second UK top 10, reaching number 6, and the album Matthew and Son reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart. The original version of the Tremeloes' hit [...] "Here Comes My Baby" [...] was written and recorded by Stevens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{life history}} of Macrosoma heliconiaria was {{originally}} described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into {{the biology of}} hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably [...] "I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> it was a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span {{a wide range of}} (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea).
