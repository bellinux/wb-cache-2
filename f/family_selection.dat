40|$|Family {{studies of}} {{exceptional}} longevity can potentially identify genetic {{and other factors}} contributing to long life and healthy aging. Although such studies seek families that are exceptionally long lived, they also need living members who can provide DNA and phenotype information. On {{the basis of these}} considerations, the authors developed a metric to rank <b>families</b> for <b>selection</b> into a <b>family</b> study of longevity. Their measure, the <b>family</b> longevity <b>selection</b> score (FLoSS), is the sum of 2 components: 1) an estimated family longevity score built from birth-, gender-, and nation-specific cohort survival probabilities and 2) a bonus for older living siblings. The authors examined properties of FLoSS-based family rankings by using data from 3 ongoing studies: the New England Centenarian Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and screenees for the Long Life <b>Family</b> Study. FLoSS-based <b>selection</b> yields <b>families</b> with exceptional longevity, satisfactory sibship sizes and numbers of living siblings, and high ages. Parameters in the FLoSS formula can be tailored for studies of specific populations or age ranges or with different conditions. The first component of the FLoSS also provides a conceptually sound survival measure to characterize exceptional longevity in individuals or families in various types of studies and correlates well with later-observed longevity. aged, 80 and over; family data; longevity; Shannon information Abbreviations: FLoSS, <b>family</b> longevity <b>selection</b> score; FRS, <b>family</b> risk score...|$|R

40|$|Human eating {{behavior}} in food selection can {{be influenced by}} intrinsic values such as liking, taste, and odor, and extrinsic factors such as social, culture, and economy. Literature reviewed indicated that social, culture, family or group influences might outweigh the intrinsic trigger factors. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to apply the proposed model by previous researchers in the Malaysian family setting. The model proposed the relationship between personal norms with satisfaction, social norms and preference conflict in making <b>family</b> food <b>selection.</b> This study was done in Klang Valley using the convenience sampling method and data were gathered using a questionnaire survey form. Survey respondents were Malaysians of at least 18 years of age, married with children and those who were responsible for preparing the meal for family members. 190 respondents participated in this study. The result showed that there is a significant mediating role by satisfaction and social norms, between personal norm and <b>family</b> food <b>selection,</b> while preference conflict is not a significant mediator. Mediation analysis and regression analysis was done to determine the most influential factors in <b>family</b> food <b>selection</b> and found the mediating role of social norms as the strongest compared to satisfaction. In conclusion, the model of personal norms, satisfaction, social norms, and preference conflict proposed by previous researchers, which was done in Western countries, had different results when applied to the Malaysian family setting. This could be due to the culture of more consensuses rather than individualism practiced by most Malaysian families compared to western families as far as <b>family</b> food <b>selection</b> is concerned...|$|R

40|$|Family {{evaluation}} {{involves the}} selection or rejection of entire families of seedlings {{based on information}} derived from replicated family plots, and is widely practised in sugarcane breeding programmes. After family evaluation, individual seedling selection is restricted to the selected elite families. Family evaluation data {{is also used to}} determine breeding values of parent populations. The objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of family evaluation and determine potential selection gains over time for quality traits across South African Sugarcane Research Institute regional breeding and selection programmes. Data for various quality traits were collected from Stage I (Single Stools) of all the regional breeding programmes and analysed using the Mixed Procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. There were highly significant (P< 0. 001) differences between families for the effectiveness of <b>family</b> <b>selection.</b> There were increasing family effects differences with advancing series, indicating the cumulative benefits of <b>family</b> <b>selection.</b> Estimated recoverable crystal (ERC) % cane, Pol % cane and Brix % cane produced the largest gains from <b>family</b> <b>selection,</b> indicating that the current approach is effective. Brix % cane, a trait that can be easily measured with a hand held refractometer, could be used to evaluate within-family variability, an important parameter for family evaluation. The 12 -month programmes produced larger gains from <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> than the longer cycle programmes. Future studies should determine the breeding values of parent populations...|$|E

Thereby two cycles of modified mass (C 1 and C 2) and one cycle of <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> were applied on a population of the Fahl variety of Egyptian clover. Plants selected for C 1 were also raised as half sib families in second season and selection was practiced between and within families for the best 10 families. Seeds of selected half-sib families and both modified mass selection cycles C 1 and C 2 along with the base population were evaluated for forage and seed yields in third season. Gains realized from C 1 and C 2 mass selection, respectively were 13. 6 and 8. 5 % for seed yield, 4. 9 and 14. 4 % for fresh forage yield, 5. 3 and 13. 2 % for dry forage yield and 9. 1 and 13. 2 % for 1000 -seed weight over the base population. While, gains from <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> as% of base population were 18. 5, 8. 9, 9. 9 and 3. 8 % for these traits in order. Broad sense heritability among half-sib families were 76. 8, 76. 1, 98. 2 and 84. 3 % for these traits, respectively. All studied traits were positively correlated but the correlation between seed yield and forage yield were weak. However, one half-sib family was 30. 1 % higher than base population in seed yield, 34. 2 % in fresh forage yield, 35. 8 % in dry forage yield and 16. 4 % heavier in seed weight.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to study the effect of two different methods of selection (modified mass and <b>family</b> <b>selection)</b> for crown diameter on forage yield and quality in Ismailia 91 alfalfa variety (Medicago sativa L.). In 2007 / 2008, two hundred plants (5 % intensity of selection) were selected for crown diameter, using the modified mass selection method. Equal seeds from each selected plant were bulked to form each of two selection cycles. Plants selected for C 1 were also raised as half-sib families in 2008 / 2009 and selection was practiced between and within half-sib families for the best 10 families (5 % intensity of selection). Seeds of selected half-sib families and both modified mass selection cycles C 1 and C 2 along with the base population were evaluated for forage yield and quality in 2009 / 2010 season. The realized gains after the two mass selection were 9. 77, 12. 68, 14. 94, 14. 00, 11. 34,- 14. 91 and 12. 47 % for crown diameter, root length, fresh forage yield, dry forage yield, crude protein, crude fiber and ash (%), respectively over the base population. Gains from <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> as% of base population were 21. 24, 16. 91, 17. 24, 16. 00, 16. 49,- 16. 41 and 18. 90 % for these traits in the same order. All studied traits were positively correlated but the correlation between crude fiber (%) and other traits were negative. However, two half sib-families (No. 1 and 6) were significantly higher than the original population for all studied traits except crude fiber (%). Results suggest that both mass and <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> for crown diameter resulted in great improvement of forage yield and quality. In addition, <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> appeared to be more rewarding than mass selection in improving yield and quality of alfalfa...|$|E

Thirty families were evaluated in the seedling generation (SG), first clonal generation (FCG) in the field and greenhouse under high temperature conditions, and second clonal generation (SCG) under mild temperatures. The mean of the families was obtained in each generation. The 16 most productive families in FCG were selected, and the clones of these families were evaluated in experiments in the winter and rainy crop seasons. The results showed that <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> for tuber shape may be applied as of the SG. It was also observed that <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> in the FCG and SCG for yield and tuber specific gravity contributed to identification of clones tolerant to heat and responsive to environmental improvement...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to select superior genotypes in half-sib populations obtained from crosses between sexual plants and apomictic accessions. The experiment also proposed to compare among and within family and combined selection strategies. Ten plots of sexual plants were randomly distributed among 230 plots of apomictic accessions. After natural pollination, seeds of each sexual plant constituted a half-sib family. Thirty plants of each female progenitor were evaluated in a randomized block design experiment, with five plants per plot and five replications. Five evaluation harvests were made in the rainy seasons and two in the dry seasons of all plants. The production and quality characteristics were evaluated. The selection criteria used was: among and within <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> and combined selection with 50 % selection in both. The selection criteria used (among and within <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> and combined selection), were efficient for use in P. maximum breeding, with medium to high gains for most characteristics evaluated.

40|$|Families {{selection}} has {{not been}} recommended as a selection method for vegetative propagated species. To verify its utility for potato improvement a series of experiments were carried out under warm temperatures (rainy season). Thirty clonal families originated from heat tolerant parents were evaluated for tuber yield and specific gravity. After obtaining the seedling generation (SG) and the first clonal generation (FCG) individual clones from a further two generations were assessed. Simulations were conducted with different intensities of <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> in SG and FCG and intensities of clonal selection in subsequent generations. The results show that <b>family</b> <b>selection</b> intensities between 50 % and 60 % allowed the greatest gains. Estimates of h 2 at the families level were always higher than at the clones level and corroborate for the more effective selection of families in early generations. The selection of families for tuber specific gravity {{can be made in}} the early generations (SG and FCG) regardless of the temperature conditions where the individual clones will be selected. The sequential selection of families with intensities of 60 % (SG) and 60 % (FCG) would promote greater efficiency for the selection of clones in second or third clonal generation. In the case of applying stronger selection intensities for a higher efficiency with sequential selection (SG and FCG) weaker intensities should be applied in the SG (60 %) and stronger intensity in FCG (40 %). <b>Family</b> <b>selection</b> for tuber yield could be practiced in the FCG as long as the selection of clones was not held in contrasting temperature conditions...|$|E

For this purpose, a comprehensive assessment method based on the Welch bound [24] including three main indexes has been proposed in [25], namely the performance in the acquisition mode, the tracking mode, and the robustness against interfering narrowband signals. Furthermore, these three indexes can be combined in a final figure or cost function in order to evaluate different candidate sets of codes. The corresponding weighted coefficients can be decided by the user groups, since the code impact varies for every type of application. The three performance indexes and cost function will be expounded in the following sections.|$|R
