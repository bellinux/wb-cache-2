James heads to the hotel's rooftop; depending on choices made by the player throughout the game, he encounters either Mary or Maria disguised as her.|$|E
5|$|Mary's Club is {{the oldest}} strip club in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. In 1954 Roy Keller bought the {{business}} <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s. Keller initially hired go-go dancers as entertainment during the piano player's breaks, later hiring them full-time because of their popularity. Topless dancers wearing pasties were introduced in 1955. The club also featured comics, musicians, singers and other acts. All-nude dancing began in 1985, after a judicial ruling against City of Portland ordinances banning it in venues which served alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} {{possibilities of}} post-apocalyptic stories about pandemics (worldwide outbreaks of disease) have been explored in novels and films <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> Shelley's 1826 The Last Man and Jack London's 1912 The Scarlet Plague onwards. Medieval writings {{that deal with}} plague include Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales: both treat the people's fear of contagion and the resulting moral decline, as well as bodily death.|$|E

5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{wrote for}} several shows before being {{hired as a}} story editor on My Friend Tony and later created the series Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and Burns at MTM Productions to create The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970. The show, {{one of the first}} to feature an {{independent}} working woman as its lead character, was critically acclaimed and won Brooks several Primetime Emmy Awards. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> Tyler Moore in the shape of Rhoda (a comedy) and Lou Grant (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom Taxi which, despite winning multiple Emmys, suffered from low ratings and was canceled twice.|$|E
5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E

Nevertheless, some contemporary Muslim scholars, an example being Martin Lings, accepted the assumption as being a historical event <b>from</b> <b>Mary's</b> life. One of the lesser-known events which are recorded in Muslim literature is that of Mary visiting Rome with John and Thaddeus (Jude), the disciples (al-Hawāriyūn) of Jesus, {{during the reign of}} Nero.|$|R
5|$|Tucker's law {{practice}} could {{not support the}} expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits, which included gambling at cards and races, and he proceeded to waste the capital <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> Tucker's estate. He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery {{to raise funds for}} the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner. He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum.|$|E
5|$|After Ingrid's {{apparent}} death, {{her soul}} transfers {{back to her}} original body (a mummified corpse) that is protected in a magical sarcophagus hidden in an alternate dimension. It is revealed that Ingrid possesses a form of immortality; she can return her soul to her original body and recover her strength. While locked in her decaying body, she instructs Sebastian to feed her regularly with blood stolen <b>from</b> <b>Mary</b> {{as a form of}} nourishment. When Sebastian seeks advice from Ingrid on how to form a romantic relationship with the newly resurrected Mary, she tells him to use witchcraft; Sebastian refuses to use magic to force Mary to love him. By drinking Mary's blood, Ingrid gains enough power to possess Mary temporarily and starts to have sex with the Devil. However, she is interrupted by Anne, who kills the Devil's human host and sends him back to hell. Anne announces that she plans to carry the Devil's child, and serve as his queen instead of Ingrid. Despite her attempts to reconnect with her daughter, Ingrid is killed by Anne. Restoring Mary's soul back to her body, Anne destroys Ingrid's body and spirit permanently.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers <b>from</b> <b>Mary.</b> She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E
