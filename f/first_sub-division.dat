The {{original}} jetty was washed away in a flood at Easter 1927; the present structure replaced it, built in 1927-28 to a length of 1152 ft. Parts of the jetty have fallen into disrepair and it requires frequent periodic repairs and replacement of its structure and decking.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, the <b>first</b> <b>sub-division</b> {{occurred}} when land {{south of the}} Glenelg-North Terrace Railway Line was sold for a new subdivision for returned servicemen's homes. In 1921, the area, which also included that part of Cummins Estate where Cummins House is located, was renamed to Novar Gardens to honour Viscount Novar, (who as Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson was the sixth Governor-General of Australia from 1914 to 1920). Hence, Cummins House is located at 23 Sheoak Avenue, Novar Gardens, South Australia.|$|E

The assembly can be further divided into three: the <b>first</b> <b>sub-division</b> is the cabinet that is led by the president, then the deputy president, the secretary-general, the deputy secretary general, there are nine ministerial portfolios as followed; Ministry of Campus and off Campus Housing, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Bursaries and Projects, Ministry of Gender and people with Disabilities, Ministry of Health, Safety and Security, Ministry of Information, External Affairs and International Relations, Ministry of Legal, Policies, and Constitutional Affairs, Ministry of Religion, Culture, Arts and Heritage, Ministry of Sports and Recreation, and with the equivanlence of a ministry there is the Chairperson of the Post Graduate Council. the second sub-division of the SRA is the Structures, these are made up of four-person executives of the Disabled Student Council (DSC), the Housing Representative Council (HRC), the Sports, Recreation and Cultural Committee (SRCC) and the School Councils from all seven faculties of the University. The third sub-division is the parliament which is composed of committees under each ministerial position.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{brings the}} tragedies of Thomas Hardy {{and those of}} Octavio de Faria {{together}} for a comparative study. In the Introduction we point to some aspects of their work which set them apart, explore the usage of bird imagery which is common to both novelists in their approach to tragic characters, examine the criticism written on their works, and present the central idea and {{the division of the}} paper per se. ^ We try to demonstrate, {{in the first part of}} the paper, how Hardy, much more effectively than de Faria, uses places, with their history, and time to achieve tragic effect in his novels. Hardy juxtaposes the transitoriness of a character 2 ̆ 7 s life to the ancient permanence of nature; de Faria, the 2 ̆ 2 palpable 2 ̆ 2 transitoriness of life on earth to the inscrutable mystery of eternal life. ^ The second part deals with the tragic hero and has two major sub-divisions. In the <b>first</b> <b>sub-division</b> we show how the tragic heroes of the 19 th and 20 th centuries are no longer prominent people in their society. They are usually outsiders but no less fascinating and complex than the ancient and the Shakespearean tragic heroes. The second sub-division goes into the inner nature of the tragic hero and shows that characters with tragic potential (1) who turn to the future with hopeful eyes cease to have tragic possibilities; (2) who are capable of detaching themselves from their suffering selves lose tragic resonance; (3) who succumb to external powers and live on in total oblivion of their selves are more pathetic than tragic; (4) who destroy themselves because they see death as the only way out of their distress diminish their tragic impact upon the reader; (5) who triumph [...] triumph through their inner lives [...] and project this feeling as they take their destiny into their own hands are the only characters who achieve full tragic stature. ^ The Conclusion sums up the ideas presented in the paper and is followed by Appendix 1, a short biographical note about Octavio de Faria, and by Appendix 2, synopses of the tragedies written by the Brazilian novelist and collected under the title of Tragedia Burguesa. ...|$|E
5|$|Ralambo's many {{enduring}} {{and significant}} {{political and cultural}} achievements of his reign have earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history. Ralambo {{was the first to}} assign the name of Imerina ("Land of the Merina people") to the central highland territories where he ruled. He moved his capital from Alasora to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby. The <b>first</b> <b>sub-divisions</b> of the andriana noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks. He introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups. The practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is also believed to have originated with this king.|$|R
50|$|The Bazigar {{are further}} sub-divided into five sub-groups, the Jogi, Badtia(vertiya), Mushal(muchhals), Jassuke, Dharamsot and Namsout. The <b>first</b> four <b>sub-divisions</b> cannot intermarry, but Namsout only marry within the clan. Historically, the Bazigar were either Hindu or Muslim, {{but with the}} {{departure}} of their Muslim patrons, the Bazigar have embraced Sikhism. They have also abandoned their traditional dialect Bazigar boli for standard Punjabi.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} divided into four chapters. The frist chapter is the introduction. Chapter two {{discusses}} the conceptualisation of the farming system {{with reference to the}} livestock component and reviews some alternative typologies that have been employed or proposed. A typological framework that is consistent with ILCA's objectives is then outlined. Chapter 3 develops a regionalisation of the semi arid zones of sub-Saharan Africa in four orders of increasing scale. The <b>first</b> order <b>sub-division</b> is between "West and North" and "East and South" geographical regions. The second order follows LPG zones by country. The third order is according to agroclimate, employing moisture, modality and monthly regimes. The fourth order subdivision develops a set of 83 environmental units. Chapter four reviews the characteristics of mixed farming system through a sample of published and unpublished literature...|$|R
5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The <b>first</b> Danish administrative <b>sub-divisioning</b> occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called hundreds (herreder in Danish). The hundreds were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of hundreds was prompted by an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish hundreds were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the vulnerability to flooding and erosion of four open beach study sites in Europe. A {{framework for the}} quantitative estimation of present and future coastal flood and erosion risks is established using methods, data and tools from {{across a range of}} disciplines, including topographic and bathymetric data, climate data from observation, hindcast and model projections, statistical modelling of current and future climates and integrated risk analysis tools. Uncertainties in the estimation of future coastal system dynamics are considered, as are the consequences for the inland systems. Different implementations of the framework are applied to the study sites which have different wave, tidal and surge climate conditions. These sites are: Santander, Spain—the Atlantic Ocean; Bellocchio, Italy—the Adriatic Sea; Varna, Bulgaria—the Black Sea; and the Teign Estuary, UK—the northern Atlantic Ocean. The complexity of each system is <b>first</b> simplified by <b>sub-division</b> into coastal “impact units” defined by homogeneity in the local key forcing parameters: wave, wind, tide, river discharge, run-off, etc. This reduces the simulation to that of a number of simpler linear problems which are treated by applying the first two components of the Source–Pathway–Receptor–Consequence (S–P–R–C) approach. The case studies reveal the flexibility of this approach, which is found useful for the rapid assessment of the risks of flooding and erosion for a range of scenarios and the likely effectiveness of flood defences...|$|R
