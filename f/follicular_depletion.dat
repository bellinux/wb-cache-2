50|$|The {{antagonistic}} pleiotropy {{hypothesis was}} first proposed by George C. Williams in 1957 as an evolutionary explanation for senescence. Pleiotropy is the phenomenon where one gene controls {{for more than}} one phenotypic trait in an organism. Antagonistic pleiotropy is when one gene controls {{for more than one}} trait where {{at least one of these}} traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness. The theme of G.C. William's idea about antagonistic pleiotropy was that if a gene caused both increased reproduction in early life and aging in later life, then senescence would be adaptive in evolution. For example, one study suggests that since <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> in human females causes both more regular cycles in early life and loss of fertility later in life through menopause, it can be selected for by having its early benefits outweigh its late costs.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{research}} suggests that type of ovarian hormone loss at menopause influences cognition. Until recently ovariectomy (OVX) has been the primary rodent model to examine effects of ovarian hormone loss on cognition. This model limits evaluations to abrupt and complete ovarian hormone loss, modeling less than 13 % of women who receive surgical menopause. The majority of women do not have their ovaries surgically removed and undergo transitional hormone loss via ovarian <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> 4 -Vinylcyclohexene-diepoxide (VCD) produces gradual ovarian <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> in the rodent, with hormone profiles more similar to naturally menopausal women vs. OVX. We directly compared VCD and OVX models to examine whether type of hormone loss (transitional vs. surgical) impacted cognition as assessed on a maze battery {{as well as the}} cholinergic system tested via scopolamine mnemonic challenge and brain acetylcholinesterase activity. Middle-aged rats received either sham surgery, OVX surgery, VCD, or VCD then OVX to assess effects of removal of residual ovarian output after transitional menopause and <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> VCD-induced transitional menopause impaired learning of a spatial recent memory task; surgical removal of residual ovarian hormones by OVX abolished this negative effect of transitional menopause. Furthermore, transitional menopause before OVX was better for memory than an abrupt loss of hormones via OVX only. Surgical ovarian hormone loss, regardless of menopause history, increased hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity. Circulating gonadotropin and androstenedione levels were related to cognitive competence. Collectively, findings suggest that in the rat, initiation of transitional menopause before surgical ovary removal can benefit mnemonic function and could obviate some negative cognitive consequences of surgical menopause alone...|$|E

Moreover, the present study demonstrated small sized follicles, empty and fused follicles accompanied by disturbance of the normal architecture of the gland.

40|$|As many {{chemotherapy}} regimens induce <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion,</b> fertility preservation {{became a}} major concern in young cancer patients. By maintaining follicles at the resting stage, gonad-otropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) were proposed as an ovarian-protective option during chemotherapy. However, their efficacy and mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. Mice were dosed with cyclophosphamide (Cy, 100 – 500 mg/kg i. p) to quantify <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> and evaluate apoptosis at different times.

Apoptosis occurs in the granulosa cells of growing follicles within 12 hours after Cy treatment, while no apoptosis was detected in resting folli-cles suggesting that chemotherapy acutely affects both resting and growing follicles through different mechanisms. We further tested the ability of both GnRH agonist and antagonist to inhibit oestrus cycles, follicular growth and FSH secretion in mice and to protect ovarian reserve against chemotherapy.

Histologic alterations of lymph nodes with PGL are classified according to three main types: follicular hyperplasia without or with follicular fragmentation, follicular involution and <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> Immunohistology demonstrates a peculiar infiltration of CD 3 +/CD 4 + and CD 3 +/CD 8 + lymphocytes in germinal centers; CD 3 +/CD 8 + are often grouped in small clusters centered by a newly formed small blood vessel. Accessory follicular dendritic reticulum cells (FDRCs) of germinal centers are characterized by a positive staining for p 24 and p 19 HIV major core antigens. In germinal centers, FDRCs undergo progressive lysis in follicular involution and in <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> Other viral antigens, such as EBV, are infrequently seen in lymph nodes from HIV-positive patients. Paracortical areas of lymph nodes are often characterized by prominent postcapillary venule proliferations and by hyperplasia of the endothelial cells which are HLA-DR positive, often p 19 and p 24 positive, and occasionally express HIV genome.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{decline in}} {{fertility}} {{is evident in}} human females past their middle thirties. This ‘reproductive senescence’, marked by {{a sharp decline in}} pregnancy rates, may be attributed to reductions in numbers of avail-able oocytes and their quality. Because Old World primates exhibit ovarian morphology and physiological control and timing of menstrual cycles closely resembling those of humans, the current study investigated the rhesus maca-que as a potential model for human reproductive senescence. METHODS: Ovaries collected from females aged 1 – 25 years and divided into five age groups were analysed histologically. RESULTS: General ovarian morphology demonstrated significant changes as the females approached menopause. The proportions of primordial and pri-mary follicles all demonstrated significant differences across age groups (primordial: 77. 1, 79. 9, 69. 7, 62. 9, 55. 1 %; primary: 21. 5, 18. 8, 28. 5, 35. 2, 43. 1 % for age groups 1 to 5 respectively; P < 0. 0001 for both). Samples from females approaching or undergoing the menopausal transition (aged 20 – 25 years) demonstrated evidence of ovar-ian senescence, having scattered and atretic follicles, low numbers of primordial follicles and reduced stromal tissue. CONCLUSION: This study supports the value of the rhesus monkey as a model for reproductive ageing because its ovary undergoes <b>follicular</b> reservoir <b>depletion</b> similiar to that seen in humans.

Menopause, the final cessation of menstrual cycling, occurs when the pool of ovarian follicles is depleted. The one to five years {{just prior to the}} menopause are usually marked by increasing variability in menstrual cycle length, frequency of ovulation, and levels of reproductive hormones. Little is known about the mechanisms that account for these characteristics of ovarian cycles as the menopause approaches. Some evidence suggests that the dwindling pool of follicles itself is responsible for cycle characteristics during the perimenopausal transition. Another hypothesis is that the increased variability reflects "slippage " of the hypothalamus, which loses the ability to regulate menstrual cycles at older reproductive ages. We examine the underlying cause of the increasing variability in menstrual cycle length prior to the menopause.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, {{is believed to be the}} mechanism for depletion of lymphocytes recognizing self antigens following clonal expansion in the bursa of Fabricius. Further, some evidence suggesting that recognition of foreign antigens, presented by the bursal follicular epithelial cells, may promote retention and expansion of selected clones by protection from apoptosis. While bursal apoptosis has previously been shown to increase following in vivo exposure to glucocorticoids, the microanatomical site of induced or normal apoptosis has not been unequivocally established. Presently, we adapted the existing TUNEL (Terminal Deoxynucleotidal Transferase Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay for use with neonatal bursae. Similar to previous reports, TUNEL revealed that normal apoptosis is preferentially, but not completely, ongoing in bursal follicular cortical cells. Administration of a single dose of either a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) or androgen (19 -nortestosterone) failed to cause <b>follicular</b> lymphocyte <b>depletion</b> and increased apoptosis per unit of area at the time points evaluated post-administration (6 or 24 hrs). However, administration of either steroid increased the interfollicular epithelial thickness, a change usually associated with edema, within 6 hr following treatment. Additionally, administration of the androgen 19 -Nortestosterone significantly decreased the number of proliferating cells as detected using mouse anti-PCNA as a primary immunohistochemical antibody. These findings extend existing data suggesting that normal bursal apoptosis occurs to a greater degree in the bursal follicular cortex although steroid-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis was not observed in these experiments. Unexpectedly, a very low incidence (0. 26 %) of follicles predominantly containing apoptotic lymphocytes was observed in normal bursal tissues. While the reason for the presence of bursal follicles consisting of predominantly apoptotic cells is not known, possible reasons are intriguing. Future elucidation of the underlying physiological or pathophysiological processes responsible for this phenomenon may lead to important clues for more complete understanding of humoral immune system ontogeny...|$|R

The diagnosis is confirmed by two blood sample at least 1 month to measure the level of FSH (over 40 UI/L) and level of estradiol (below 50 pmol/L). Ovarian <b>follicular</b> dysfunction and/or <b>depletion</b> of functional primordial follicles characterized this pathology. Abnormal bleeding patterns also include oligomenrrhea and polimenorrhea; because of these irregular menstrual cycles during adolescence, diagnosis could be difficult in young women. Excluding the cases in which an etiopathogenetic agent could be identified, such as in case of chemio- and radiotherapy or extensive surgery, women with autoimmune diseases and/or infections, the etiology of POI remains idiopathic. An important genetic component exists, supported by both a frequent recurring familiar event (20 - 30 %) and the association with other different genetic disorders in particular the X chromosome defects and the implication of some different genes with significant functions in ovarian development. For most of the women the diagnosis of POI is unexpected because of there are no obvious signs or symptoms that precede the cessation of periods with a normal menstrual history, age of menarche and fertility prior to the onset of menopause. The diagnosis of POI has a deleterious psychological impact on the emotional sphere of the women affected: anger, depression, anxiety and sadness are common {{and the fact that the}} diagnosis coincides with infertility needs a psychological support.

The increasing number of prospective parents undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) due to advanced reproductive age, however, reflects the discrepancy between socio-cultural development and physical limits.

Consequently, the knowledge concerning age-related changes of reproductive functions gains in importance. While <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> and impaired oocyte quality, frequently also called diminished ovarian reserve, are generally acknowledged as the underlying mechanisms for the decline in maternal fecundity, the way to correctly assess the status of ovarian reserve has remained controversial. Besides increasing attempts to achieve conception, deferring pregnancy and delivery into older age also implies medical risks and ethical considerations. The use of IVF in older women, therefore, raises the issue of the utilization of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in the assessment of embryonic aneuploidies, as well as in attempts to optimize pregnancy rates with IVF.

However, the molecular mechanism that maintains the long quiescence of primordial follicles is poorly understood.

Our results suggest that Tsc/mTORC 1 signaling and PTEN/PI 3 K (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase) signaling synergistically regulate the dormancy and activation of primordial follicles, and together ensure the proper length of female reproductive life.

40|$|The {{majority}} of ovarian primordial follicles must be preserved in a quiescent state {{to allow for}} the regular production of gametes over the female reproductive lifespan. However, the molecular mechanism that maintains the long quiescence of primordial follicles is poorly understood. Under certain pathological conditions, the entire pool of primordial follicles matures simultaneously leading to an accelerated loss of primordial follicles and to premature ovarian failure (POF). We have previously shown that loss of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) in mouse oocytes leads to premature activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, subsequent <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> in early adulthood, and the onset of POF. Lack of PTEN leads to increased phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) signaling in the oocytes.

When administered to Pten-deficient mice prior to the activation of the primordial follicles, rapamycin effectively prevented global follicular activation and preserved the ovarian reserve.

We conclude that the clinically asymptomatic period of HIV- 1 infection is characterized by pathological stages in lymphoid tissues that have distinct histological alterations and distribution of viral RNA...|$|E
40|$|Premature ovarian failure (POF) is {{a primary}} ovarian defect {{characterized}} by absent menarche (primary amenorrhea) or premature depletion of ovarian follicles {{before the age of}} 40 years (secondary amenorrhea). It is a heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 1 % of women < 40 years, 1 : 10, 000 women by age 20 and 1 : 1, 000 women by age 30. The most severe forms present with absent pubertal development and primary amenorrhea (50 % of these cases due to ovarian dysgenesis), whereas forms with post-pubertal onset are characterized by disappearance of menstrual cycles (secondary amenorrhea) associated with premature <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> As in the case of physiological menopause, POF presents by typical manifestations of climacterium: infertility associated with palpitations, heat intolerance, flushes, anxiety, depression, fatigue. POF is biochemically characterized by low levels of gonadal hormones (estrogens and inhibins) and high levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea). Beyond infertility, hormone defects may cause severe neurological, metabolic or cardiovascular consequences and lead to the early onset of osteoporosis. Heterogeneity of POF is also reflected by the variety of possible causes, including autoimmunity, toxics, drugs, as well as genetic defects. POF has a strong genetic component. X chromosome abnormalities (e. g. Turner syndrome) represent the major cause of primary amenorrhea associated with ovarian dysgenesis. Despite the description of several candidate genes, the cause of POF remains undetermined {{in the vast majority of}} the cases. Management includes substitution of the hormone defect by estrogen/progestin preparations. The only solution presently available for the fertility defect in women with absent follicular reserve is ovum donation...|$|E
40|$|Repeated daily dosing of rats {{with the}} {{occupational}} chemical 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) depletes the ovary of primordial and primary follicles through {{an increase in}} the natural process of atresia. Additionally, in vitro exposure of Postnatal Day 4 (PND 4) rat ovaries to VCD causes similar <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion.</b> This study was designed to investigate survival signaling pathways that may be associated with VCD-induced ovotoxicity in small preantral follicles. Female Fischer 344 rats (PND 28) were dosed daily (80 mg/kg/day VCD i. p.; 12 days in vivo), and PND 4 ovaries were cultured (VCD 20 or 30 μM; 8 days in vitro). Microarray analysis identified a subset of 14 genes whose expression was increased or decreased by VCD in both experiments (i. e., via both exposure routes). Particularly, the analysis showed that relative to controls, VCD did not affect mRNA expression of growth and differentiation factor 9 (Gdf 9), whereas there were decreases in mRNA encoding bone morphogenic protein receptor 1 a (Bmpr 1 a) and Kit. To confirm findings from microarray, the genes Gdf 9, Bmpr 1 a, and Kit were further examined. When growth factors associated with these pathways were added to ovarian cultures during VCD exposure, GDF 9 and BMP 4 had no effect on VCD-induced ovotoxicity; however, KITL attenuated this follicle loss. Additionally, there was a decrease in Kit and an increase in Kitl expression (mRNA and protein) following VCD exposure, relative to control. These results support that VCD compromises KIT/KITL signaling, which is critical for follicular survival in primordial and primary follicles...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{testosterone}} excess programs {{an array}} of adult reproductive disorders including luteinizing hormone excess, functional hyperandrogenism, neuroendocrine defects, polycystic ovarian morphology, and corpus luteum dysfunction, culminating in early reproductive failure. Polycystic ovarian morphology originates from enhanced follicular recruitment and follicular persistence. We tested to determine whether prenatal testosterone treatment, by its androgenic actions, enhances follicular recruitment, causes early depletion of follicular reserve, and disrupts the ovarian architecture. Pregnant sheep were given twice-weekly injections of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a nonaromatizable androgen, from Days 30 to 90 of gestation. Ovaries were obtained from Day- 90 and Day- 140 fetuses, and from 10 -mo-old females during a synchronized follicular phase (n = 5 – 9 per treatment). Stereological techniques were used to quantify changes in ovarian follicle/germ cell populations. Results revealed no differences in numbers of oocytes and follicles between the three groups on Fetal Day 90. Greater numbers of early growing follicles were found in prenatal testosterone- and DHT-treated fetuses on Day 140. Increased numbers of growing follicles and reduced numbers of primordial follicles were found in 10 -mo-old, prenatal testosterone-treated females, but not in those treated with DHT. Antral follicles of prenatal testosterone-treated females, but not those treated with DHT, manifested several abnormalities, which included the appearance of hemorrhagic and luteinized follicles and abnormal early antrum formation. Both treatment groups showed morphological differences in the rete ovarii. These findings suggest that increased follicular recruitment and morphologic changes in the rete ovarii of prenatal testosterone-treated females are facilitated by androgenic programming, but that postpubertal follicular growth, antral follicular disruptions, and <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> largely occur through estrogenic programming...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{reactive}} {{with the}} ovarian glycoprotein zona pellucida (ZP) {{have been linked}} with human female infertility. Anti-fertility vaccines that target ZP antigens have been utilized to restrict pest animal populations and their efficacy is associated with ovary-specific antibody induction. However, the necessity for zona pellucida-specific antibody in mediating infertility has not been examined in vivo. A recombinant mouse cytomegalovirus vaccine encoding murine zona pellucida 3 that induces rapid and complete infertility in BALB/c mice has been produced. The onset of infertility is temporally related {{to the presence of}} antibody sequestered into ovarian follicles and binding to the ZP of infected mice and the loss of mature follicles. When this vaccine was inoculated into immunoglobulin-deficient BALB/c mice with a null mutation in the immunoglobulin mu chain gene Igh- 6, fertility was unaffected. Passive transfer of serum containing ZP 3 antibodies also elicited transient infertility. Electron microscopy of ovarian tissue collected from ZP 3 -immunized immunocompetent mice demonstrated significant focal thinning of the zona pellucida (ZP) with reduced length and concentration of transzonal processes and many oocytes displayed evidence of injury. None of these changes were found in vaccinated immunoglobulin-deficient mice. These data confirm that ZP 3 -reactive antibody is necessary and sufficient to induce autoimmune-mediated <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> and fertility suppression following the inoculation of this vaccine, and suggest that this is due to impaired zona pellucida formation. These findings have relevance in understanding the etiology of autoimmune ovarian disease in woman where anti-ZP antibodies are likely to have a causal role in infertility. Megan L. Lloyd, John M.

40|$|AbstractMammalian females enter puberty with {{follicular}} reserves {{that exceed}} the number needed for ovulation during a single lifetime. <b>Follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> occurs throughout reproductive life and ends in menopause, or reproductive senescence, when the follicle pool is exhausted. The mechanisms regulating {{the production of}} a species-specific initial follicle pool are not well understood. However, the establishment of a follicular reserve is critical to defining the length of reproductive cyclicity. Here we show that activin A (rh-ActA), a known regulator of follicle formation and growth in vitro, increased the number of postnatal mouse primordial follicles by 30 % when administered to neonatal animals during the time of germline cyst breakdown and follicle assembly. This expansion in the initial follicle pool was characterized by a significant increase in both germ cell and granulosa cell proliferation. However, the excess follicles formed shortly after birth did not persist into puberty and both adult rh-ActA- and vehicle-treated animals demonstrated normal fertility. A follicle atresia kinetic constant (kA) was modeled for the two groups of animals, and consistent with the empirical data, the kA for rh-ActA-treated was twice that of vehicle-treated animals. Kinetic constants for follicle formation, follicle loss and follicle expansion from birth to postnatal day 19 were also derived for vehicle and rh-ActA treatment conditions. Importantly, introduction of exogenous rh-ActA revealed an intrinsic ovarian quorum sensing mechanism that controls the number of follicles available at puberty. We propose that there is an optimal number of oocytes present at puberty, and when the follicle number is exceeded, it occurs at the expense of oocyte quality. The proposed mechanism provides a means by which the ovary eliminates excess follicles containing oocytes of poor quality prior to puberty, thus maintaining fertility in the face of abnormal hormonal stimuli in the prepubertal period...|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} results of ovarian transplantation in clinical practice are encouraging. However, the <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> caused by ischemic injury is a main concern and {{is directly related}} to short-term graft survival. Cell therapy with adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) could be an alternative to induce early angiogenesis in the graft. This study aimed to evaluate ASCs therapy in rat cryopreserved ovarian grafts. A single dose of rat ASC (rASCs) or vehicle was injected into the bilateral cryopreserved ovaries of twelve adult female rats immediately after an autologous transplant. Daily vaginal smears were performed for estrous cycle evaluation until euthanasia on postoperative day 30. Follicle viability, graft morphology and apoptosis were assessed. No differences were found with respect to estrous cycle resumption and follicle viability (P > 0. 05). However, compared with the vehicle-treated grafts, the morphology of the ASCs-treated grafts was impaired, with diffuse atrophy and increased apoptosis (P < 0. 05). ASCs direct injected in the stroma of rat cryopreserved ovarian grafts impaired its morphology although may not interfere with the functional resumption on short-term. Further investigations are necessary to evaluated whether it could compromise their viability in the long-term.

40|$|Because only 25 % {{of cases}} of {{premature}} ovarian insufficiency (POI) have a known etiology, {{the aim of this}} review was to summarize the associations and mechanisms {{of the impact of the}} environment on this pathology. Eligible studies were selected from an electronic literature search from the PUBMED database from January 2000 to February 2016 and associated references in published studies. Search terms included ovary, follicle, oocyte, endocrine disruptor, environmental exposure, occupational exposure, environmental contaminant, pesticide, polyaromatic hydrocarbon, polychlorinated biphenyl PCB, phenol, bisphenol, flame retardant, phthalate, dioxin, phytoestrogen, tobacco, smoke, cigarette, cosmetic, xenobiotic. The literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We have included the human and animal studies corresponding to the terms and published in English. We have excluded articles that included results that did not concern ovarian pathology and those focused on ovarian cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis or precocious puberty. We have also excluded genetic, auto-immune or iatrogenic causes from our analysis. Finally, we have excluded animal data that does not concern mammals and studies based on results from in vitro culture. Data have been grouped according to the studied pollutants in order to synthetize their impact on follicular development and follicular atresia and the molecular pathways involved. Ninety-seven studies appeared to be eligible and were included in the present study, even though few directly address POI. Phthalates, bisphenol A, pesticides and tobacco were the most reported substances having a negative impact on ovarian function with an increased <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion</b> leading to an earlier age of menopause onset. These effects were found when exposure occured at different times throughout the lifetime from the prenatal to the adult period, possibly due to different mechanisms. The main mechanism seemed to be an increase in atresia of pre-antral follicles. Environmental pollutants are probably a cause of POI. Health officials and the general public must be aware of this environmental effect in order to implement individual and global preventive actions...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an {{autosomal}} dominant tumor suppressor disorder characterized by hamartomas, or benign growths, in various organ systems. Inactivating mutations {{in either the}} TSC 1 or the TSC 2 gene cause most cases of TSC. Recently, the use of ovarian specific conditional knock-out mouse models has demonstrated a crucial role of the TSC genes in ovarian function. Mice with complete deletion of Tsc 1 or Tsc 2 showed accelerated ovarian follicle activation and subsequent premature <b>follicular</b> <b>depletion,</b> consistent with the human condition premature ovarian failure (POF). POF is defined in women as the cessation of menses {{before the age of}} 40 and elevated levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The prevalence of POF is estimated to be 1 %, affecting a substantial number of women in the general population. Nonetheless, the etiology of most cases of POF remains unknown. Based on the mouse model results, we hypothesized that the human TSC 1 and TSC 2 genes are likely to be crucial for ovarian development and function. Moreover, since women with TSC already have one inactivated TSC gene, we further hypothesized that they may show a higher prevalence of POF. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed 1000 women with TSC belonging to the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, a national support organization. 182 questionnaires were analyzed for information on menstrual and reproductive function, as well as TSC. This self-reported data revealed 8 women (4. 4 %) with possible POF, as determined by menstrual history report and additional supportive data. This prevalence is much higher than 1 % in the general population. Data from all women suggested other reproductive pathology associated with TSC such as a high rate of miscarriage (41. 2 %) and menstrual irregularity of any kind (31. 2 %). These results establish a previously unappreciated effect of TSC on women’s reproductive health. Moreover, these data suggest that perturbations in the cellular pathways regulated by the TSC genes may {{play an important role in}} reproductive function...|$|E
