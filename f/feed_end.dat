2500|$|The M3/M3A1's 30-round {{magazine}} {{was the source}} of complaints throughout the service life of the weapon. [...] Unlike the Thompson, the M3 fed from a double-column, single-feed detachable box magazine which held 30 rounds and was patterned after the British Sten magazine; the single-feed design proved difficult to load by hand, and was more easily jammed by mud, dust, and dirt than double-column, double-feed designs like the Thompson. [...] Additionally, the feed lips of the single-feed design proved more susceptible to feed malfunctions when slightly bent or damaged. Plastic dust caps were later issued to cover the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> of the magazine and keep out dust as well as protect the sensitive feed lips.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{optimise}} capacity and performance, {{it is desirable}} to pre-concentrate the feed slurry as much as possible. Some designs have a short conical section at the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> for prethickening within the unit, but generally it is preferable to thicken before entering the centrifuge with gravity settlers, hydrocyclones or inclined screens, producing a higher concentration of solids.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a heated gas. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> (known as co-current flow), or toward the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|Sugarcane {{diffusion}} is {{the process}} of extracting the sucrose from the cane with the use of imbibtion but without the squeezing by mills. Shredded cane is introduced into the diffuser at the <b>feed</b> <b>end,</b> Hot water is poured over the shredded cane just before the discharge end of the diffuser. The hot water percolates through the bed of cane and removes sucrose from the cane. This dilute juice is then collected in a compartment under the bed of cane and is pumped to a point a little closer to the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> of the diffuser and this dilute juice is allowed to percolate through the bed of cane. At this point the concentration of sucrose in the cane is higher than the concentration of sucrose in the dilute juice just mentioned and so sucrose diffuses from the cane to the juice, this now slightly richer juice is pumped back up the diffuser and the process is repeated, typically, 12 to 15 times (compared with the four to six times for the milling process) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold rubber lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the <b>feed</b> <b>end,</b> which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). [...] While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand.|$|E
50|$|A trommel screen, {{also known}} as a rotary screen, is a {{mechanical}} screening machine used to separate materials, mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the <b>feed</b> <b>end.</b> Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum, where the undersized material smaller than the screen apertures passes through the screen, while the oversized material exits {{at the other end of}} the drum.|$|E
50|$|Stations receive {{over their}} {{computers}} the daily rundown of stories before each program which {{allows them to}} plan their coverage and decide what stories they wish to replace with local content. The rundown is updated as necessary until the <b>feed</b> <b>ends</b> at noon Eastern time.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in {{developing}} a technical process to manufacture castings is to organize risering at the stage of solidification, which ensures the set level on shrinkable porosity and shrinkage cavities. As known, generally, the risering zone consists of a feeder zone and a <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone. In references the terms of final (end) effect action or an effective area of the casting edge is possible to encounter rather than the term of <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone. The values of <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone are used to calculate a directional solidification in the casting mould. The design procedure of a directional solidification of castings is follows. The first design section is advised to settle down at the distance equal to the zone of <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end.</b> The subsequent design sections are advisable to settle down at distances a little bit less, than the zone of <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end.</b> The padding (lap) value ought to be selected to provide the later solidification of the upper sections of casting {{with respect to the}} sections lying below. A series of special experiments on castings of the simple configuration (slabs and bars) defines a value of the feeding zone of a butt end and makes it out as the regressional dependences of the <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone on the characteristic sizes of this or that casting. Thus, considerable material and time expenditures are demanded to define the value of the <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone to be used further, including calculation of directional solidification of castings. The paper offers a design procedure to calculate a zone of the <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> via computing simulation of solidification in a casting mould thereby sharply reducing expenditures for searching the desirable values. To reveal spaces in the casting, staggered with shrinkable porosity, the new criteria of porosity developed in BMSTU are used. The paper shows a possibility to use the effective size as a characteristic parameter of casting for dependence of the <b>feeding</b> butt <b>end</b> zone thus providing this dependence universality and a possibility to use it for making any shaped casting, but not just the castings of a simple configuration. </p...|$|R

The game was also subsequently available on the BBC's on demand service, iPlayer. Sky Sports broadcast the game in both standard and high definition using Fox's feed and announcers.|$|R
50|$|Deck - a deck is frame or {{apparatus}} {{that holds the}} screen cloth in place. It also contains the screening drive. It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> to the discharge end. Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there {{are a series of}} decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks. Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground product}} is {{separated}} from the grinding medium at the discharge end of the mill. This is achieved without using screens by using a patented product separator that consists of a rotor and a displacement body (see Figure 2 and Figure 4). The relatively short distance between the last disk results in a centrifugal action that forces coarse particles towards the mill shell, from where they flow back towards the <b>feed</b> <b>end.</b> This action retains the grinding medium within the mill.|$|E
5000|$|An {{asymmetrical}} {{spring steel}} clip of ten rounds in a double-staggered column {{would then be}} inserted, <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> up, into the magazine against the spring pressure of the magazine follower; when fully inserted the clip would be caught and held by a catch. (Note: this clip, like the clip used in the Austrian Model 95 rifle, could only be inserted one way and thus could potentially cause confusion under the stress of combat). Unloading the magazine would be done by (if necessary) retracting and holding open the breech mechanism, then pushing the trigger forward from its neutral position; the clip and any remaining cartridges would be ejected upward.|$|E

5000|$|The IsaMill usually {{consists}} {{of a series of}} eight disks mounted on a rotating shaft inside a cylindrical shell (see Figure 2). The mill is 70-80% filled with the grinding medium, and is operated under a pressure of 100 to 200 kilopascals. The disks contain slots to allow the ore slurry to pass from the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> to the discharge end (see Figure 3). The area between each disk is effectively an individual grinding chamber, and the grinding medium is set in motion by the rotation of the disks, which accelerate the medium toward the shell. This action is most pronounced close to the disks. The medium flows back toward the shaft in the zone near the midpoint between the disks, creating a circulation of the grinding medium between each pair of disks, as shown in Figure 4.|$|E

50|$|Until September 2009, to {{accommodate}} Here & Nows 6:00 p.m. timeslot, the network provided a separate Newfoundland Time feed of its weekday afternoon schedule between 4:00 and 6:00 local time. The 7:00 p.m. NT timeslot was then taken by Land and Sea (Monday) and repeats of Living Newfoundland and Labrador (Tuesday-Friday). As a result, the network program that normally aired at 3:30 p.m. local time (such as the Great Canadian Food Show) was pre-empted entirely.

30|$|Attenuated total {{reflection}} (ATR)–Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{was used to}} characterize the chemical nature of fouling species on different spiral wound membranes operated at Al-Jubail SWRO plant. Three membranes from different companies operated {{for a period of}} 1  year were opened for autopsy, and difference spectra were obtained for the fouled membrane from virgin membranes. The spectra of the foulants were easy to distinguish from the spectra of membrane material. The results showed that the membrane surface of the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> element was more heavily fouled than the brine end of the element. ATR/FTIR indicated a distinct enhancement to the amide I (1650  cm− 1) and amide II (1550  cm− 1) bands indicative of protein, and the C–O stretching band associated with polysaccharides is visible near 1040  cm− 1. The deposits removed from the surface of membranes showed distinctive bands at 3270 and 1080  cm− 1 associated with amino group/polysaccharide.|$|E

50|$|The grazing {{habits of}} the sheep have also adapted to their unusual diet: instead of grazing {{during the day and}} ruminating (digesting) at night as other sheep {{generally}} do, the North Ronaldsays graze as the tide uncovers the shore (twice in 24 hours), ruminating at high water. Feeding begins around 3.5 hours after high tide as the areas of kelp and seaweed are exposed. Four hours later, which is just after the low tide, <b>feeding</b> <b>ends,</b> allowing rumination to begin. This cycle reduces the chance of the sheep becoming stranded at sea by the incoming tide.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} to total energy self sufficiency of kraft mills {{appears to be the}} fossil fuel requirements of the lime kilns. If an economical technology can be developed which allows fossil fuel to be replaced {{in whole or in part}} by wood-based fuel, the savings in fossil fuel by the pulp and paper industry would be very substantial. Our study focuses around the direct in-situ combustion of hog fuel fed from the cold <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> in order to substantially reduce the fossil fuel fired from the hot product discharge end of the lime kiln. Thus far we have carried out two series of tests using two different pilot-scale kilns and dry limestone in the first test series and mill produced lime mud in the second test series. Mill scale trials have just been completed and the preliminary results indicate that our approach is potentially a very cost-effective and simple option to substantially reduce or possibly eliminate fossil-fuel usage in lime kilns...|$|E
40|$|The {{periodic}} process utilizes a rapid pressure swing cycle in an adsorbent bed {{to effect the}} separation of gas mixtures. During the first portion of a cycle the compressed gas mixture flows into the adsorbent-filled column. Next, while the feed gas is restrained, an exhaust orifice is opened at the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> of the column providing depressurization. The product stream is enriched in the component exhibiting the lowest coefficient of adsorption. A mathematical model based upon the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium between the gas phase and the adsorbed gas was formulated and solved to simulate the periodic, adsorption process. The measured nitrogen content of the product gas stream was found to correlate with {{the ratio of the}} product gas rate to the feed gas rate.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} mass-burn, waste-to-energy combustion chamber has been developed that includes stochastic representation of the variability of the fuel (municipal solid waste, MSW). The drying, pyrolysis, gasification and combustion processes on the moving grate are governed by several factors such as proximate and ultimate analysis, particle size, moisture, heating value, and bulk density, all of which change continuously. This extreme variability has not been considered in past {{mathematical model}}s of WTE combustion that used mean values of the MSW properties. The Monte Carlo stochastic method {{has been applied to}} provide a time series description of the continuous variation of solid wastes at the <b>feed</b> <b>end</b> of the traveling grate. The combustion of the solid particles on the grate is simulated using percolation theory. The feed variation and the percolation theory models are combined with the FLIC two-dimensional bed model developed by Sheffield University to project the transient phenomena in the bed, such as the break-up of waste particles and the channeling of combustion air throughout the bed, and their effects on the combustion process...|$|E
