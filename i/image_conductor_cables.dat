50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, traction current lines with two systems (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables)</b> typically have a single level arrangement of the <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> For traction current lines with four systems (8 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables),</b> the two-level arrangement (4 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction current lines supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> {{and each of the}} two highest cross bars have two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables).</b> For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating current, some overhead line pylons have cross bars for traction current lines above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.|$|R

Comparisons are made between round wire <b>cable</b> and flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable.</b> The flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> interconnecting harness systems show major cost, weight, and space savings, plus increased system performance and reliability. The design application section includes electrical characteristics, harness design and development, {{and a full}} treatise on EMC considerations. Manufacturing and quality control sections pertain primarily to the developed conductor-contact connector system and special flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> to round wire cable transitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{load-carrying}} {{and thermal}} characteristics of flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> and round wire cables {{have been investigated}} with all <b>conductors</b> in each <b>cable</b> under varying loads in air and vacuum environments. The test procedure is described and results are presented in graphic form. Derating factors for both round wire and flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> are established for operation in a vacuum environment. Rating factors are established for flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> for use with round wire loading tables. The results of these tests show that single layer flat conductor size, or that the voltage drop across flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> will be {{lower than that of}} round cable under the same load...|$|R

The undercarpet {{system is designed}} for use in office and commercial buildings. It employs a flat power cable, protected by a grounded metal shield, that terminates in receptacles mounted on the floor. It is designed to interface with a flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> telephone system. The baseboard system consists of a flat power cable mounted in a plastic raceway; both the raceway and the receptacles are mounted {{on the surface of}} the baseboard.

50|$|Traction current {{lines are}} not usually laid {{parallel}} to the railway line, so as to minimise the line length and to avoid unnecessary influences of electrical system near the railway line. However, there are cases where this practice is not followed (for example, the current supply of some rapid-transit railways operating with alternating current in Germany). In this case, the traction current line is laid on special cross beams of the overhead wire pylons above the overhead line. Because overhead line pylons possess a smaller cross section than traction current masts, these cross beams have to be quite narrow, so the arrangement of four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> in one level, which is standard at traction current lines, cannot be used. Where four conductors are needed, one approach is to employ a two-level arrangement of <b>conductor</b> <b>cables.</b> Alternatively, in cases of double-tracked railway lines, the overhead line pylons for both driving directions are equipped with cross beams for the traction current system (two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables).</b>|$|R

50|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to lay out the}} traction current supply on special cross beams right on the overhead wire pylons above the catenary wire. Because the overhead line pylons have a smaller cross section than traction current supply masts, the cross beams cannot be too wide, so the standard arrangement of four <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> in one level cannot be used. In this case, a two-level arrangement is used, or with two electric circuits for double-railed lines the overhead line pylons for both directions are equipped with cross beams for their own traction current system of two <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> each.|$|R
40|$|A flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cabling</b> {{system for}} electrical/electronic {{interwiring}} is described. Six major items comprise the system: the cables, splices - one for flat cable to round wires {{and one for}} flat cable to flat cable; a series of flat cable connectors; the distributor, which is used for interconnecting the circuits; and a repair technique for the falt cable. Polyarylene, a new high performance melt-processable insulation material, permits {{the design of a}} completely standardized, modular flat <b>conductor</b> flat <b>cable.</b> The development of an advanced heat-shrinkable plastics technology involving the use of selectively bonded plastic film has resulted in the multiple termination module, used for making high-reliability sealed solder terminations to either flat <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> or round wires.

50|$|The {{standard}} dictates color-coded connectors {{for easy}} identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors {{are different from}} one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any <b>conductor</b> of the <b>cable.</b> Since the old 40 <b>conductor</b> <b>cables</b> do not ground pin 34, {{the presence of a}} ground connection indicates that an 80 <b>conductor</b> <b>cable</b> is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.|$|R
