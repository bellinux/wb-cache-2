25|$|Symptoms of <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> vary greatly, and can {{be mistaken}} for the {{symptoms}} of a food allergy. While true allergies are associated with fast-acting immunoglobulin IgE responses, {{it can be difficult}} to determine the offending food causing a <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> because the response generally takes place over a prolonged period of time. Thus, the causative agent and the response are separated in time, and may not be obviously related. <b>Food</b> <b>intolerance</b> symptoms usually begin about half an hour after eating or drinking the food in question, but sometimes symptoms may be delayed by up to 48 hours.|$|E

40|$|Are <b>food</b> <b>intolerances</b> and allergies {{increasing}} in immigrant children coming from developing countries? In the last 25 yr the migratory flow from devel-oping countries towards Italy has quickly in-creased and to day {{a large part}} of the immigrant adults living in Italy has a regular residence permit and get married (1). Consequently, the number of infants born in Italy from immigrant parents and of immigrant children coming from their native countries to join their original families have largely increased during these last years [in December 2001 they were 326, 101 (1), amounting to 2 % of the entire paediatric popu-lation living in Italy]. These children share the same environment of the Italian ones and, whether they have also the same dietary habits as consequence of their integration with the customs of the Italian childhood population, may be at risk for <b>food</b> <b>intolerances</b> and allergies.

25|$|In the USA food {{companies}} propose distinguishing between food allergy and <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> {{and use a}} mechanism-based (i.e., immunoglobulin-E-mediated), acute life-threatening anaphylaxis that is standardized and measurable and reflects the severity of health risk, as the principal inclusion criterion for food allergen labeling. Symptoms due to, or exacerbated by, food additives usually involve non-IgE-mediated mechanisms (<b>food</b> <b>intolerance)</b> and are usually less severe than those induced by food allergy, but can include anaphylaxis.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> {{can include}} {{hydrogen}} breath testing for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption, professionally supervised elimination diets, and ELISA testing for IgG-mediated immune responses to specific foods. It {{is important to}} be able to distinguish between food allergy, <b>food</b> <b>intolerance,</b> and autoimmune disease in the management of these disorders. Non-IgE-mediated intolerance is more chronic, less acute, less obvious in its clinical presentation, and often more difficult to diagnose than allergy, as skin tests and standard immunological studies are not helpful. Elimination diets must remove all poorly tolerated foods, or all foods containing offending compounds. Clinical investigation is generally undertaken only for more serious cases, as for minor complaints which do not significantly limit the person's lifestyle the cure may be more inconvenient than the problem.|$|E
25|$|A {{randomised}} controlled {{trial on}} IBS patients found relaxing an IgG-mediated <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> diet led to a 24% greater deterioration in symptoms compared to those on the elimination diet and concluded food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research.|$|E

25|$|<b>Food</b> <b>intolerance</b> is a {{detrimental}} reaction, often delayed, to a food, beverage, food additive, or compound {{found in}} foods that produces symptoms {{in one or}} more body organs and systems, but generally refers to reactions other than food allergy.

25|$|A Cochrane review has {{concluded}} feeding with a soy formula cannot be recommended for prevention of allergy or <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> in infants. Further research may be warranted {{to determine the}} role of soy formulas for prevention of allergy or <b>food</b> <b>intolerance</b> in infants unable to be breast fed with a strong family history of allergy or cow's milk protein intolerance. In the case of allergy and celiac disease others recommend a dietary regimen is effective {{in the prevention of}} allergic diseases in high-risk infants, particularly in early infancy regarding food allergy and eczema. The most effective dietary regimen is exclusively breastfeeding for at least 4–6 months or, in absence of breast milk, formulas with documented reduced allergenicity for at least the first 4 months, combined with avoidance of solid food and cow's milk for the first 4 months.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{patients}} and their doctors (GPs) have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS.

40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>intolerances</b> and <b>food</b> allergies are {{evolving}} and {{diagnoses of}} such conditions are rapidly increasing.

This interdisciplinary pilot study utilizes a mixed method approach, including sociologically and anthropologically-based surveys and participant observation, respectively, and is guided by the action research approach. Data analysis illustrates major gaps in access to healthcare, specifically to dietitians, and in food acquisition from government agencies and food pantries.

25|$|A {{food allergy}} is an {{abnormal}} immune response to food. The {{signs and symptoms}} may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis. <b>Food</b> <b>intolerance</b> and food poisoning are separate conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Australian {{researchers}} published {{details of}} an 'exclusion diet' to exclude specific food chemicals from the diet of patients.

40|$|<b>Food</b> {{allergies and}} <b>intolerances</b> are {{examples}} of adverse food reactions and describe adverse reactions to foods. Regardless of whether classified as either an allergy or intolerance, dietary management should be handled by a qualified dietitian/nutritionist (in conjunction with an allergist {{in the case of}} food allergies), since self imposed restrictions may lead to nutritional deficiencies. The area of <b>food</b> allergies and <b>intolerances</b> is not at all clear-cut. Accurate diagnosis is essential, and this usually requires a referral from a General Practitioner to an Allergist. Understanding <b>food</b> allergies and <b>intolerances</b> This section is kindly adapted from Friendly Food, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Allergy Unit. Understanding the difference between intolerance and other types of food reaction is an important starting point because the approach to dealing with them is quite different. Unlike allergies and coeliac disease, which are immune reactions to <b>food</b> proteins, <b>intolerances</b> don’t involve the immune system at all. They are triggered by food chemicals which cause reactions by irritating nerve endings {{in different parts of the}} body, rather in the way that certain drugs can cause sideeffects in sensitive people (2).

50|$|An allergy is {{different}} from an <b>intolerance.</b> <b>Food</b> allergies and <b>food</b> <b>intolerances</b> {{should not be confused}} because they do not contain the same risks and are not diagnosed the same way. Allergies can be fatal after only a small consumption, while intolerance, although uncomfortable, are not as deadly. An intolerance may lead to a nutrient deficiency which could cause death if untreated but the intolerance itself is not enough to cause rapid death. Allergies, with their varying symptoms, could cause instantaneous death if there is inflammation in the throat and causes suffocation.|$|R
