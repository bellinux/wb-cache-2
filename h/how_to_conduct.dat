5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little understanding of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Georg Forster {{was born}} in the small village of Nassenhuben (Mokry Dwór) near Danzig (Gdańsk), in the {{province}} of Royal Prussia, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the oldest of seven surviving children of Johann Reinhold Forster and Justina Elisabeth (née Nicolai). His father was a naturalist, scientist and Reformed pastor. In 1765, the Russian empress Catherine II commissioned the pastor to travel through Russia on a research journey and investigate the situation of a German colony on the Volga River. Georg, then ten years old, joined him. On the journey, which reached the Kalmyk steppe on the lower Volga, they discovered several new species, and the young Forster learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> scientific research and practice cartography. He also became fluent in Russian.|$|E

5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I {{is a legal}} treatise, {{written in}} about 1115, that records the legal customs of medieval England in the reign of King Henry I of England. Although {{it is not an}} {{official}} document, it was written by someone apparently associated with the royal administration. It lists and explains the laws, and includes explanations of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> legal proceedings. Although its title implies that these laws were issued by King Henry, it lists laws issued by earlier monarchs that were still in force in Henry's reign; the only law of Henry that is included is the coronation charter he issued at the start of his reign. It covers a diverse range of subjects, including ecclesiastical cases, treason, murder, theft, feuds, assessment of danegeld, and the amounts of judicial fines.|$|E
