40|$|Copper-Graphite {{laminate}} material design has been analysed, and this proposed composite {{has the ability}} to enhance heat dispersing more efficiently compared to the traditional high thermal conductivity with weight associated copper and high thermal resistance graphite. A finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out using the material (Cu – Gr) properties to investigate this proof. The design, thermal properties (temperature, total thermal resistance) are compared with existing and proven mathematical model. The dimensionless expression is used to compute the maximum spreading thermal resistance, surface temperature and this is compared with thermally simulated temperature and the total resistance of the spreader material. The performance is tested using length (l), width (w), thickness (t) and the total thermal resistance (R) (Dimensions for material). The results for the thermal conductance of (Cu-Gr) obtained is 2. 5 x 105 W/ (m 2 K) with negligible error percentage to predict the 2 -D design as a suitable <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>material.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Diamond {{reinforced}} metals {{are being}} developed for use as highly sophisticated <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>material</b> in power electronics or satellite laser optics. These particle reinforced composites combine the excellent thermal properties of diamond with a metal matrix, which enables shaping and joining onto the components. The mismatch in thermal expansion and Young s moduli of matrix metal and diamond reinforcement is responsible for high micro stresses under operational conditions of thermal cycling. These stresses may lead to interface delamination and or matrix damage degrading the initially good thermal properties. Therefore, the interface bonding strength and the deformability of the matrix determine the quality of such metal matrix composites. Aluminum is favored as matrix metal due to its high ductility and carbide forming ability on diamond surfaces, which significantly improves the interface bonding strength. Silver offers high thermal conductivity and alloying with silicon produces reactivity with diamond, giving strong bonding strength. The tensile behavior of both composites was investigated by non destructive in situ neutron diffraction and acoustic emission AE measurements. Post mortem scanning electron microscopy reveal the bonding quality of the composites correlated to the reinforcement architecture and the plasticity of the matrices. Conclusions on the elasto plastic deformation behavior of the investigated composites for thermal management application are draw...|$|E
40|$|The {{market for}} high power diode lasers is still growing very fast (more than 10 % a year). New {{applications}} are developed permanent {{and the range}} besides telecommunication, automobile and medical industries is rising rapidly Because of the bright facilities of high power diode lasers plenty of niche applications also benefit from the high efficiency of the semiconductors. The interests in the R&D departments of diode laser industries have {{changed in the last}} years. Not the maximum of the emitted optical power out of the array is the main focus of the investigations anymore. The lifetime of the package is the critical value of the high power diode laser bars. A lot of R&D projects are focused on this issue. Common packages use a copper heat sink and Indium soft solder for mounting the laser bar. In the field of thigh power applications (> 100 W optical output power) water cooled heat sinks are necessary. In combination with the needed deionized water and high flow rates (0. 5 l/min) corrosion is hard to prevent. Therefore, new cooling techniques are needed. In the last 12 months a lot of new solutions to increase the lifetime of the high power diode laser packages have been developed. Basically the new solutions are divided into two groups. One is using new high performance materials, especially diamond composites. Their thermal conductivity is announced with up to 600 W/mK depending on the suppliers. This <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>material</b> has a thermal conductivity which is up to 50 % better than pure copper and will replace water cooled heat sinks. The other is using new materials combinations for their active cooled heat sink instead of copper.

40|$|Graphene-based <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>materials,</b> {{including}} graphene-based film (GBF) and graphene-based {{electrically conductive}} adhesive (G-CA), {{were applied to}} electronics packaging. The thermal performances of GBF and G-CA were analyzed by resistance temperature detector (RTD) and thermal infrared imager. When the chip was covered by GBF and G-CA, the temperature of hotspot could be reduced by 3. 1 °C, at heat flux of 580 W/cm 2. To analyze the thermal performances of G-CA and GBF in 3 D electronics packaging, the distribution of temperature and temperature profiles on the top surface of chip were analyzed by COMSOL. Both of GBF and G-CA could obviously reduce the temperature of hotspot on the top surface of chip, compared with that on the bare chip. With G-CA and GBF, the temperature of hotspot could be reduced by 8 °C.

40|$|Vapor chamber {{technologies}} {{offer an}} attractive approach for passive cooling in portable electronic devices. Due {{to the market}} trends in device power consumption and thickness, vapor chamber effectiveness must be compared with alternative <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>materials</b> at ultrathin form factors and low heat dissipation rates. A test facility is developed to experimentally characterize performance and analyze the behavior of ultrathin vapor chambers that must reject heat to the ambient via natural convection. The evaporatorside and ambient temperatures are measured directly; the condenser-side surface temperature distribution, which has critical ergonomics implications, is measured using an infrared (IR) camera calibrated pixel-by-pixel over {{the field of view}} and operating temperature range. The high thermal resistance imposed by natural convection in the vapor chamber heat dissipation pathway requires accurate prediction of the parasitic heat losses from the test facility using a combined experimental and numerical calibration procedure. Solid metal heat spreaders of known thermal conductivity are first tested, and the temperature distribution is reproduced using a numerical model for conduction in the heat spreader and thermal insulation by iteratively adjusting the external boundary conditions. A regression expression for the heat loss is developed as a function of measured operating conditions using the numerical model. A sample vapor chamber is tested for heat inputs below 2. 5 W. Performance metrics are developed to characterize heat spreader performance in terms of the effective thermal resistance and the condenser-side temperature uniformity. The study offers a rigorous approach for testing and analysis of new vapor chamber designs, with accurate characterization of their performance relative to other heat spreaders...|$|R

This angle {{has been used}} for thermal design of electronic devices, and provides a <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> area inside a board, e. g. printed circuit board, which is placed between a heat dissipating element and a relatively large heat sink. By using this angle, the heat transfer behavior can be estimated quickly without using high-performance computers. In addition, the rough design can be made easily by changing design parameters. This angle is effective in a practical situation; however, the discussion has not been made sufficiently on the applicability of the 45 ˚ <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> angle. In the present study, there-fore, the extensive numerical investigation is conducted for the rational thermal design using the 45 ˚ <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> angle. The two-dimensional mathematical model of the board is considered; the center of the top is heated by a heat source while the bottom is entirely cooled by a heat sink. The temperature distribution is obtained by solving the heat conduction equation numerically with the boundary conditions.

40|$|Modern space field {{programmable}} {{gate array}} (FPGA) devices with increased functional density and operational frequency, such as Xilinx Virtex 4 (V 4) and S (V 5), are packaged in non-hermetic ceramic flip chip forms. These next generation space parts were not qualified to the MIL-PRF- 38535 Qualified Manufacturer Listing (QML) class-V when they were released because class-V was only intended for hermetic parts. In order to bring Xilinx V 5 type packages into the QML system, it was suggested that class-Y be set up as a new category. From 2010 through 2014, a JEDEC G 12 task group developed screening and qualification requirements for Class-Y products. The Document Standardization Division of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has completed an engineering practice study. In parallel with the class-Y efforts, the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) program has funded JPL to study potential reliability issues of the class-Y products. The major hurdle of this task was the absence of adequate research samples. Figure 1 - 1 shows schematic diagrams of typical structures of class-Y type products. Typically, class-Y products are either in ceramic flip chip column grid array (CGA) or land grid array (LGA) form. In class-Y packages, underfill and <b>heat</b> <b>spread</b> adhesive <b>materials</b> are directly exposed to the spacecraft environment due to their non-hermeticity. One of the concerns originally raised was that the underfill material could degrade due to the spacecraft environment and negatively impact the reliability of the package. In order to study such issues, it was necessary to use ceramic daisy chain flip chip package samples so that continuity of flip chip solder bumps could be monitored during the reliability tests. However, none of the commercially available class-Y daisy chain parts had electrical connections through flip chip solder bumps; only solder columns were daisy chained, which made it impossible to test continuity of flip chip solder bumps without using extremely costly functional parts. Among space parts manufacturers who were interested in producing class-Y products, Aeroflex Microelectronic Solutions-HiRel had been developing assembly processes using their internal R&D classy type samples. In early 2012, JPL and Aeroflex initiated a collaboration to study reliability of the Aeroflex technology as a class-Y demonstrator...|$|R

The application of deformable mirrors with high laser loads calls for a large <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> capability of the deformable unimorph mirrors. A large <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> capability is attributed to high thermal conductivity of the materials that is not allocated by LTCC. The present paper reports {{on the effect of}} internal silver conductor (DuPont 6145) on the <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> capability of the LTCC membrane. Therefore, internal silver conductor is applicated into a 570 µm thin membrane on a diameter of 49. 8 mm. The optical absorption of plain LTCC membranes and membranes with internal metallization is characterized by an Ulbricht sphere. Membranes with internal silver conductor and a reference sample without internal metallization (plain LTCC) are loaded with a laser beam. The absorbed laser power heats the LTCC membrane. We investigate the temperature increase upon one-Watt laser loading and prove a 37 % lower setting maximum temperature (Tmax) for membranes with internal silver conductor compared to plain LTCC membranes. The characteristics of temperature over time are similar to the charging of a capacitor. The time constant for the internally metallized and plain LTCC membrane at same peak temperatures are similar. These results show the potential of internal silver conductor to increase the <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> capability of LTCC membranes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to present the analytical solutions to the <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> problems that arise due to a flux specified circular heat source on a finite thickness substrate with isothermal or convective surfaces. The solutions to <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> resistance of these problems are obtained {{for the first time}} by the exact treatment of the mixed boundary conditions present on the substrate at the heat source side. In the case of <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> through a substrate with isothermal surfaces the solution method utilizes the two-dimensional axisymmetric equation of thermal conduction allowing for the convective cooling over source region. In the absence of convection over the source, it is shown that the total thermal resistance is composed of spreading resistance of an otherwise isothermal substrate and a correction due to inhomogeneous substrate thermal boundary condition. The application of the method of superposition elucidates the exact definition of source adiabatic temperature that takes care of the correction due to inhomogeneous substrate thermal boundary condition. In the case of <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> through a substrate with convective surfaces it is also shown that the expression for the total thermal resistance can be decomposed into a base solution and a correction. Thus the effects of the unequal heat sinks are consolidated in an approximate way to an equivalent or effective heat sink, Stheta 1 that contributes the correction of Stheta 1 to the base resistance of the homogeneous solution where the upper and lower heat sink temperatures are the same...|$|R

40|$|Vapor chamber {{technologies}} {{offer an}} attractive approach for passive <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> in mobile electronic devices, in which {{meeting the demand}} for increased functionality and performance is hampered by a reliance on conventional conductive heat spreaders. However, market trends in device thickness mandate that vapor chambers be designed to operate effectively at ultra-thin (sub-millimeter) thicknesses. At these form factors, the lateral thermal resistance of vapor chambers is governed by the saturation temperature/ pressure gradient in the confined vapor core. In addition, thermal management requirements of mobile electronic devices are increasingly governed by user comfort; <b>heat</b> <b>spreading</b> technologies must be designed specifically to mitigate hot spots on the device skin. The current work considers these unique transport limitations and thermal requirements encountered in mobile applications, and develops a methodology {{for the design of}} vapor chambers to yield improved condenser-side temperature uniformity at ultra-thin form factors. Unlike previous approaches that have focused on designing evaporator-side wicks for reduced thermal resistance and delayed dryout at higher operating powers, the current work focuses on manipulating the condenser-side wick to improve lateral <b>heat</b> <b>spreading.</b> The proposed condenser-side wick designs are evaluated using a 3 D numerical vapor chamber transport model that accurately captures conjugate heat transport, phase change at the liquid–vapor interface, and pressurization of the vapor core due to evaporation.
