"The {{inference}} is, then," [...] {{the detective}} said smoothly, [...] "that this man obtained admission to your rooms {{by means of}} a <b>false</b> <b>key,</b> that he burnt some papers here and shot himself within a few moments of your return. Either that or some other person also obtained admission here and shot him, and that person is either still upon the premises or escaped without your notice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mat {{opened the}} box for an instant, {{on his way to}} the barber's; and, taking out the <b>false</b> <b>key,</b> (which, though made of baser metal, was almost as bright as the original), put it {{carefully}} into his waistcoat pocket. He then stopped at an oil and candle shop, and bought a wax taper and a box of matches. [...] "The garden door's safest: I'll chance it with the garden-door," [...] thought Mat, as he sat down in the shaving-shop chair, and ordered the barber to operate on his chin.|$|E
6000|$|Though it {{was still}} early, his mind had been {{employed}} for some hours past in considering how the second and only difficulty, which now stood {{between him and the}} possession of the Hair Bracelet, might best be overcome. Having already procured the first requisite for executing his design, how was he next to profit by what he had gained? Knowing that the <b>false</b> <b>key</b> would be placed in his hands that evening, how was he to open Mr. Blyth's bureau without risking discovery by the owner, or by some other person in the house? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Answer: It is {{doubtful}} {{if he had}} any such knowledge. The probabilities are that he noticed how carefully Mr. Macallan secured his Diary from observation; that he inferred therefrom the existence of dangerous domestic secrets in the locked-up pages; and that he speculated on using those secrets for his own purpose when he caused the <b>false</b> <b>keys</b> to be made.|$|R
50|$|In the Garden of Life, the Sisters of the Dark {{discover}} the correct box and open it; however, {{they find a}} flaw in their success.

[...] "Nothing very terrible could happen to you beyond being turned out of the house even were it discovered who you really are; but if you were found at night, and I suppose your intention is to work at night, in the library, with a <b>false</b> <b>key</b> in your possession, you might be arrested for an attempt at theft, and could only clear yourself by explaining before the magistrates who you were, and with what motive you were acting, which would give rise to much unpleasant talk, would render any pursuance of your plan impossible, and might not improbably induce these women to destroy the will, if they have not already done so." ...|$|E

'Well!' {{said the}} exasperated Bounderby, 'while he was snoring, or choking, or Dutch-clocking, or {{something}} or other - being asleep - some fellows, somehow, whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen, got to young Tom's safe, forced it, and abstracted the contents. Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs. Sparsit's pillow) with a <b>false</b> <b>key,</b> which was {{picked up in the}} street near the Bank, about twelve o'clock to-day. No alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices for business. Then, looking at Tom's safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money gone.' ...|$|E
60|$|No {{one could}} go to bed, and before five o'clock Phoebe came down, dressed for the day, and set {{to work with the}} butler and the {{inventory}} of the plate to draw up an account of the losses. Not merely the plate in common use was gone, but the costly services and ornaments that had been the glory of old Mr. Fulmort's heart; and the locks had not been broken but opened with a key; the drawing-rooms had been rifled of their expensive bijouterie, and the foray would have been completely successful had it included the jewels. There were no marks of a violent entrance; windows and doors were all fastened as usual, with the single exception of the back door, which was found ajar, but with no traces of having been opened in an unusual manner, though the heavy bolts and bars would have precluded an entrance from the outside even with a <b>false</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E

"Why, {{the story}} is," [...] said the guide, [...] "that young Douglass had <b>false</b> <b>keys</b> made, to {{resemble}} the true ones as nearly as possible, so as to deceive his mother.

I will show you where he did this, and explain how he did it, when {{we go into the}} square tower." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{unlocked}} the topmost partition, and revealed {{a number of}} small drawers. Eagerly he drew out the topmost one, and looked inside. Then he knew the worst. It was empty. There was no longer any doubt whatever. His cottage had been entered by no ordinary housebreaker, for the purpose of plunder, but with a set of <b>false</b> <b>keys,</b> and with a far more serious object. The secret on which more than his life depended was gone! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a room {{above the}} bed chamber," [...] said the guide, [...] "as we see by {{the windows and}} the fireplace, {{but there was no}} {{stairway}} to it from Queen Mary's apartments. The only access to it was through that door, which leads in {{from the top of the}} rampart wall. And there is another room below, and partly under ground. That is the room where Walter Scott represents the <b>false</b> <b>keys</b> to have been forged." ...|$|R
60|$|While the wick of {{the taper}} was burning up, he listened again. Except {{the sound of}} his own heavy breathing, all was quiet around him. He {{advanced}} at once to the bureau, starting involuntarily as he brushed by Mr. Blyth's lay figure with the Spanish hat and the Roman toga; and cursing it under his breath for standing in his way, {{as if it had been}} a living creature. The door leading from the studio into the passage of the house was not quite closed; but he never noticed this as he passed to the bureau, though it stood close to the chink left between the door and the post. He had the <b>false</b> <b>key</b> in his hand; he knew that he should be in possession of the Hair Bracelet in another moment; and, his impatience for once getting the better of his cunning, he pounced on the bureau, without looking aside first either to the right or the left.|$|E
60|$|Don't betray me, I {{wish to be}} your friend.

60|$|The police {{seemed to}} think that they could make but little either of the coat or of the key, unless other evidence, that would be almost {{sufficient}} in itself, should be found. Lord Fawn was informed that his testimony would probably be required at another trial,--which intimation affected him so grievously that his friends {{for a week or two}} thought that he would altogether sink under his miseries. But he would say nothing which would seem to criminate Mealyus. A man hurrying along with a grey coat was all that he could swear to now,--professing himself to be altogether ignorant whether the man, as seen by him, had been tall or short. And then the manufacture of the key,--though it was that which made every one feel sure that Mealyus was the murderer,--did not, in truth, afford the slightest evidence against him. Even had it been proved that he had certainly used the <b>false</b> <b>key</b> and left Mrs. Meager's house on the night in question, that would not have sufficed at all to prove that therefore he had committed a murder in Berkeley Street. No doubt Mr. Bonteen had been his enemy,--and Mr. Bonteen had been murdered by an enemy. But so great had been the man's luck that no real evidence seemed to touch him. Nobody doubted;--but then but few had doubted before as to the guilt of Phineas Finn.|$|E
50|$|Although {{nothing came}} {{of the first}} plot, shortly {{afterwards}} he was party to the Dudley conspiracy to dethrone Mary in favour of her sister Elizabeth. Hunnis, having some knowledge of alchemy, was to go abroad to coin the necessary gold, but this doubtful mission was exchanged for the task of making <b>false</b> <b>keys</b> to the treasury in London, which {{he was able to}} do because of his friendship with Nicholas Brigham, the receiver of the exchequer. The conspirators were, however, betrayed by one of their number, Thomas Whyte. Some of them were executed, but Hunnis escaped with imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|Before Hobbs and his revolutionary lock designs, locks {{were opened}} {{by making a}} series of <b>false</b> <b>keys,</b> {{in a process that}} could take {{extremely}} long periods of time; if the series was not properly completed in the lock, and the combination not exactly correct, the lock could not be defeated. This design was accepted as quite unbreakable until Hobbs became the first to be able to pick them, by using very fine and careful manual dexterity; applying a certain level of pressure on the bolt while manipulating each lever, one at time, using a tiny pick inserted through the keyhole.|$|R

50|$|The {{travellers}} now {{return to}} Arbitan’s island using their travel dials. Altos and Sabetha have travelled ahead with {{all but the}} last Key in their possession. They {{do not know the}} old Keeper is dead and that Yartek is now in charge, clothed in Arbitan’s robes to maintain the ruse. Yartek has seized the first four Keys and holds Altos and Sabetha prisoner while he awaits the fifth and final one. When the Doctor and his three friends arrive they soon realize that the Voord have taken control of the tower and the Conscience. The Doctor frees Sabetha and Altos and then unmasks the Voord. Ian too has played his part, and given Yartek the <b>false</b> <b>key</b> from the Screaming Jungle. When Yartek places the <b>false</b> <b>Key</b> in the Conscience, the machine explodes and he is killed along with the occupying Voord. The Doctor and his friends flee the tower with Altos and Sabetha before the growing blaze overtakes the ancient structure.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{presenting}} a new countermeasure against Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks, whose implementation {{is based on}} a hardware-software co-design. The hardware architecture consists of a microprocessor, which executes the algorithm using a <b>false</b> <b>key,</b> and a coprocessor that performs several operations that are necessary to retrieve the original text that was encrypted with the real key. The coprocessor hardly affects the power consumption of the device, so that any classical attack based on such power consumption would reveal a <b>false</b> <b>key.</b> Additionally, as the operations carried out by the coprocessor are performed in parallel with the microprocessor, the execution time devoted for encrypting a specific text is not affected by the proposed countermeasure. In order to verify the correctness of our proposal, the system was implemented on a Virtex 5 FPGA. Different SCA attacks were performed on several functions of AES algorithm. Experimental results show in all cases that the system is effectively protected by revealing a false encryption key. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|E
