The SNRA was one of the settings of the 2010 3-D computer animated film Alpha and Omega.|$|E
5|$|When <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> for {{the first}} time he was a few years younger than I am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
25|$|There was {{governmental}} and administrative {{support for the}} communal riots in Gujarat. I gave several letters to Prime Minister Vajpayee in this regard on this issue. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> personally and talked to him directly. But Vajpayee did not do anything effective.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> only <b>met</b> <b>him</b> once, and I'm {{bound to}} say I thought him a most charming man.|$|R
60|$|I then {{remembered that}} his {{apartment}} at Baden, where <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> was bare, {{and had no}} bed in it.|$|R
60|$|MAUD. So you see I don't {{know him}} very well. <b>I</b> only <b>met</b> <b>him</b> once--at the club. We {{had a drink}} together.|$|R
500|$|Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley {{during this}} period in Las Vegas, where she {{was working as a}} showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> I {{mentioned}} to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E
500|$|Scott Wells, {{a racing}} correspondent, wrote in The Speedhorse Magazine that Go Man Go [...] "grew up lean and hard-boned, long-bodied and long-hipped, {{but not the}} best looking horse in the world. Not the best looking, just the best." [...] Go Man Go had a {{reputation}} for being difficult to handle. His trainer once told Walt Wiggins, Sr. that Go Man Go was [...] "jes plain mean as a bear most of the time". Throughout his racing career, Go Man Go stayed mean. One of his jockeys, Robert Strauss, recalled later that Go Man Go [...] "was ornery from the day <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> but he was the greatest horse I ever rode".|$|E
500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Björk was {{intending}} to have several producers {{work on the}} album, but this idea never came to fruition. Björk was then {{going to have the}} album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul, Sinéad O'Connor and Massive Attack, which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating that [...] "I thought Nellee was too 'good taste' for my liking. But then <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> got to know him, [...] got to hear about his fabulous ideas..." [...] Björk and Hooper's recording ideas were very similar, which led to the decision to end production work with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers. Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] with Hooper and produced [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] solely herself. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person. Like from the second <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> I just knew he was kind of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands how to break it down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to the way he did with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no reason}} why he shouldn't, if it amuses him," [...] Carroll replied. [...] "When <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> he'd have been more careful of his clothes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know his}} character--and unless he's badly slandered that's enough! <b>I</b> haven't <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> but I'm nearly {{sure it was}} a city man I saw in Driscoll's camp." ...|$|R
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quinn {{discussed}} McCartney's {{reaction to}} the film in an April 18, 2004 interview: [...] "Just after I finished the film, I went on holiday and Paul McCartney was staying at the same place. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and we became quite friendly. Later, he saw the film and fortunately he liked it. It would have been terrible if he'd hated it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barihun {{plays with}} Nadav Haber's quartet on their highly {{acclaimed}} Addis Mist concert, starting 2006. Haber describes {{his meeting with}} Barihun as {{an important step in}} his musical development: [...] "Abbate taught me what the saxophone can do in Ethiopian music, and only after <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> I became an Ethiopian saxophonist myself. The inspiration he gave me made me start practicing twice as much".|$|E
2500|$|... "Immediately {{after the}} failure of the Camp David , <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Paris upon his return.... Camp David had failed, and he said to me, 'You should remain in Paris.' I asked him why, and he said, 'Because I am going to start an intifada. They want me to betray the Palestinian cause. They want me to give up on our principles, and I will not do so,'" [...] the {{research}} institute [...] translated Suha as saying.|$|E
2500|$|... 's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper made {{a public}} {{statement}} on March 20, 2008, saying, [...] "Canada shares the concerns {{about what is}} happening in Tibet. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama told me when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and as he has been saying recently, his message is one of non-violence and [...] and I join him in that call. Canada calls upon China to fully respect human rights and peaceful protest." [...] Canada also calls on China to show [...] "restraint in dealing with this difficult situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|Konoe {{justified}} his demission to {{his secretary}} Kenji Tomita. [...] "Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and {{he wished to}} avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2004, Vine {{said that}} she had only seen Thomson once, in an art shop, in the {{previous}} two years. She later told The Times that it was [...] "impossible to explain" [...] why she married Thomson, that he didn't [...] "give a s*** about art or the Stuckist movement", and that he saw her as a means of gaining his own publicity: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and he saw some of my history, he saw dollar signs. He is a very exploitative man." [...] Thomson said she showed herself in a manner to gain the largest amount of attention or sympathy, avoided reality and created a fantasy world : [...] "Now it makes me question a lot of things she told me about her past." [...] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, {{a few weeks after the}} ceremony—"I owed him that"—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which [...] "I've never seen him again." ...|$|E
60|$|One may imagine, then, my {{extraordinary}} {{interest in}} <b>him</b> when <b>I</b> actually <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in the flesh. Yet the thing came about quite simply, indeed more by accident than by design, an adventure open to all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where does he come from, {{this strange}} man?" [...] the Princess asked. [...] "It {{is all the}} time in my mind that <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>him</b> somewhere. <b>I</b> am sure that he is one of us." ...|$|R
