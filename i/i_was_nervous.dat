500|$|Almost a {{year after}} filming her final scenes, Lister {{explained}} that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: [...] "It felt {{it was time to}} go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [...] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 10:44a.m., on {{the morning}} after the attack, Roof was {{captured}} in a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, approximately [...] from the shooting scene. A [...]45-caliber pistol was found in the car during the arrest, though it was not immediately clear if it was the same one used in the attack. Police received a tip-off from a woman who recognized Roof driving his car, a black Hyundai Elantra with South Carolina license plates and a three-flag [...] "Confederate States of America" [...] bumper decoration, on U.S. Route 74, recalling security camera images taken at the church and distributed to the media. She later recalled, [...] "I got closer and saw that haircut. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous.</b> I had the worst feeling. Is that him or not him?" [...] She called her employer, who contacted local police, and then tailed the suspect's car for [...] until she was certain authorities were moving in for an arrest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>nervous</b> in stormy weather--don't notice me." [...] She went on {{abruptly}} {{with her}} inquiries. [...] "Will {{you tell me}} the date of your father's death?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rogers Hornsby had {{his first}} plate {{appearance}} against Lear on September 10, 1915. Lear pitched a complete game victory that day, whereas Hornsby said of his nerves against Lear, [...] "Naw, why should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>nervous?</b> The other birds was hittin' him." ...|$|R

2500|$|In May, Tunney competed at the 2012 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Brussels, Belgium. [...] After qualifications, Tunney said, [...] "I competed at the 2010 junior Euros {{but that}} was nothing like here, with a full crowd, it was really great I enjoyed every minute of it. I've {{been working on the}} new vault, the Yurchenko double twist and it's paying off, I was really happy with that today." [...] In team finals, she competed on vault, uneven bars, and floor for the British team which placed fourth. [...] "I had good {{performances}} all round and I'm really happy with how the team have done. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> coming into this event but think I've coped really well. To make no mistakes in all my routines so far is brilliant, my floor has been solid all week so I'm looking forward to the final tomorrow." [...] In event finals, she finished fifth on floor with a score of 13.800.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 June 1906, Benson again {{wrote in}} his diary, [...] "I HAVE FINISHED ANTI-CHRIST. And really {{there is no more}} to be said.

6000|$|... "I {{do think}} that the best way," [...] Walter said. [...] "Of course, I shall ride in with you, and hand you over to the friends you are going to, in the town, and shall then come back here again with a light heart. But I own that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>nervous</b> at the thought of you and Claire being here, should the rapparees attack the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do watch one, certainly! I see it {{has already}} begun." [...] Mrs. Vivian laid her hand upon her daughter's with a little murmur of tender deprecation, and the girl bent over and kissed her. [...] "Mamma will tell you it 's the effect of agitation," [...] she said--"that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>nervous,</b> and don't know what <b>I</b> say. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{supposed}} to be agitated by Mr. Wright's departure; is n't that it, mamma?" ...|$|R

60|$|Say {{what you}} will, reader--tell me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> or mad; affirm that I was {{unsettled}} by {{the excitement of}} that letter; declare that I dreamed; this I vow--I saw there--in that room--on that night--an image like--a NUN.|$|E
60|$|We {{went away}} early. Agatha was none {{the worse for}} her strange excursion, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> and unstrung, unable to listen to or answer the stream of {{comments}} which Wilson was pouring out for my benefit.

6000|$|... "No, no, I beg of you," [...] Aunt Mildred interposed. [...] "It is too uncanny. It surely {{is wrong}} to tamper with the dead.

6000|$|... "Christian Young {{has never}} had any {{experience}} with large boats. Besides, we can't afford to pay him what he's clearing on the Minerva. Sparrowhawk is a good man--to take orders. He has no initiative. He's an able sailor, but he can't command.

60|$|Halliford and Shepperton {{are both}} pretty little spots where they touch the river; {{but there is}} nothing {{remarkable}} about either of them. There is a tomb in Shepperton churchyard, however, with a poem on it, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> lest Harris should want to get out and fool round it. I saw him fix a longing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it, so I managed, by an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water, and in the excitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my clumsiness, he forgot all about his beloved graves.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR AUTHOR,--Pardon {{me for my}} {{harshness}} last night, {{and come}} [...] to see me at once. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> and anxious, as you were.

6000|$|... "Well, I haf a lot {{of reasons}} to be afraid all my time. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dreadfully <b>nervous</b> now; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not trusting anybody. I suppose you haf been killing lots of Germans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect the}} fellow was prowling about here for some time," [...] Mark said. [...] "I was chatting {{with my father}} in the library when I thought I heard a noise, and I threw open the window, which had by some {{carelessness}} been left a little open, and went out, and listened for nearly an hour, but I could hear nothing, and put {{it down to the}} fact that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> owing to what had happened early in the evening, and that the noise was simply fancy, or that the frost had caused a dry branch of one of the shrubs to crack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got up to}} shut {{my window}} last night, and saw a light in the alley. A dim one, but bright enough {{to show me the}} same white thing going up and down, with the veil as before. I'll confess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> then, for you know there is a story that in old times the man who lived here wouldn't let his {{daughter}} marry the lover she wanted, and she pined away and died, and said she'd haunt the cruel father, and she did. Old Mrs. Foster told me all about it when I first came, and Madame asked me not to repeat it, so I never did. I don't believe in ghosts, mind you, but what on earth is it, trailing about in that ridiculous way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{rooms are}} only just round the corner.' She shut the door, {{and for the}} first time we looked at one another. I could not say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous,</b> but there was certainly, to me, a {{something}} strange in the atmosphere. Last night seemed a long way off and somehow a little unreal. I suppose I must have shown this in my manner, for she suddenly broke what had amounted to a distinct pause by giving a little laugh. 'Peter,' she said, 'you're embarrassed.' I denied the charge warmly, but without real conviction. I was embarrassed. 'Then you ought to be,' she said. 'Last night, when I was looking my very best in a lovely dress, you asked me to marry you. Now you see me again in cold blood, and you're wondering how you can back out of it without hurting my feelings.' ...|$|E
