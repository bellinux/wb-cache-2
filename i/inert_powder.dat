40|$|Insect {{societies}} face constant {{challenges from}} disease agents. Ants deploy diverse antimicrobial compounds against pathogens {{and the key}} sources are metapleural glands (MGs). Are MG products passively secreted and used indiscriminately or are they selectively used when ants are challenged by pathogens? In 26 species from five subfamilies, ants use foreleg movements to precisely groom the MG opening. In the absence of experimental infection, MG grooming rates are low and workers groom themselves after contacting the MGs. The derived leaf-cutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) also groom their fungal gardens, substrata (leaves), queens and nest-mates after MG grooming. Atta respond to a challenge by fungal conidia by increasing the rate of MG grooming, but do not do so when an <b>inert</b> <b>powder</b> is applied. This increase occurs in the first hour after a potential infection, after which it returns to baseline levels. Ants with open MGs produce more infrabuccal pellets (IP) than ants with sealed MGs and conidia within pellets from the former {{are less likely to}} germinate.

The principal aim was to determine if there is a significant difference in the amount and type of rescue medication required for adult hay fever sufferers to control their symptoms while using either the <b>inert</b> cellulose <b>powder</b> or a placebo. The second objective was to see whether the cellulose powder resulted in an improvement in symptom control. Research design: A double blind, placebo controlled study was conducted of 97 adult hay fever sufferers, over the grass pollen season of 2004. Participants (selectively recruited to be living within the catchment area of a 50 -km radius from Worcester, UK) were assigned randomly to two groups (A, Active and B, Placebo) matched by age by decades and gender. Of those completing the trial, group A had 19 males and 28 females and group B had 21 males and 29 females. There were no significant differences between the groups in age distributions, severity of symptoms over the last 2 years or in medication taken. They completed daily symptom diary score cards and were allowed to take any medications they wished in addition to the <b>inert</b> cellulose <b>powder</b> or placebo because medication use was taken as an outcome measure. Results were analysed in relation to pollen counts. Results: Significant differences were found in the amounts of rescue medication taken by the active and placebo groups (p < 0. 05).

The surface of the grain silos were treated with diatom earth with a commercial assay (1. 0 kg / t of product). For the cooling of the grains, cold air was blown through the aeration system silos until the grains reach a temperature of 17 ° C between the layers. After cooling, it is the retention period of five months. The monitoring of insects in the Silo A was accomplished by collecting infested grain and / or insects with probes. In Silo B, the monitoring was done through the capture of insects with traps of the type calador.

40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used tools for the study of gun firing phenomenology, in terms of knowledge and performance evaluation. Modelling codes have to describe accurately the internal ballistics cycle, from the ignition of the propellant charge to the dynamics of the gun powder and projectile motion. The ignition behaviour of the solid propellant bed influences significantly the ignition delay and propagation of the combustion wave. Ignition models for gun propellants currently used are generally based on a threshold in terms of temperature or heat generation in the solid or gas phase. This kind of ignition model is challenged by the thermal behaviour of the new generation insensitive gun propellants. Modelling the ignition of such propellant requires improvement of the ignition model. In particular, this model should provide a better description of the response of the material to the energetic stimuli from the igniter. An internal ballistics code has been developed within the framework of a cooperation between NEXTER Munitions and the PRISME Laboratory. It focuses on the description of the heat and mass transfers between gas and porous media. This code takes into account solid phase decomposition kinetics and gas phase reaction mechanisms. It aims at describing the propellant behaviour in the early stages of the internal ballistics cycle. Depending on the hypotheses made A numerical tool for evaluating solid propellants ignition models on the heat and mass transfer correlations and the description of the thermal behaviour of both the solid and gas phases, an ignition model or criterion can be determined. The Figure 1 illustrates some of the current abilities of the code : modelling the propagation of the hot gases released by the igniter through the solid propellant bed. The grains are heated by convective and radiative fluxes, and start reacting when the ignition threshold of 400 K is reached at their surface. In the present work, the code and its hypotheses are first described. The model of compressible porous flow through a bed of <b>inert</b> <b>powder</b> is compared to compressible 1 D and 2 D test cases, and a submodel of temperature conduction in the solid phase at the vicinity of the propellant grain surface is added and validated by reproducing semi infinite wall transcient conduction theoretical behaviour.

The present study investigates the insecticidal effect of powdered materials on the pharaoh ant, a notorious domestic pest. RESULTS The insecticidal activity of 24 porous materials was tested. 8 of these materials performed better than the benchmark, diatomaceous earth. Zeolite Y and carbon black II performed best, inducing 50 % mortality within 40 minutes and 55 minutes respectively. Statistical analysis of 7 material properties revealed that macroporous surface area and BET specific surface area were most predictive of insecticidal activity. For zeolites and ordered mesoporous silica materials the most important parameters were respectively BET and large mesopore surface area.

Variable of this study consists of gas temperature (40, 50, 60, 70, 80 oC), gas flowrate (0, 025; 0, 030, 0, 035, 0, 040, 0, 045 kg/s), and initial moisture content of feed (18, 19, 20, 21, 22 %). The result shows an increase in drying rate with increasing gas temperature and flowrate, and initial moisture content of feed. Efficiency of the powder production increases with increasing gas temperature and flowrate and initial moisture content of feed. The wettability and dispersibility of powder needs to be improved, while its flowability and cohesivity is good. Keywords : fluidized bed dryer, <b>inert</b> particle, <b>powder,</b> soymil...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of the chemical nature and the fineness of the fillers on the hydration process and on the compressive strength development. Four different types of fillers are considered in combination with Portland cement: quartzite filler, alumina filler, limestone filler, and silica fume. The study deals with blended mortars having a 0. 45 water to powder (cement and filler) ratio with a 10 % substitution of cement by filler. Quartzite fillers do not seem to accelerate the hydration process in a significant way. No positive effect is noticed on the strength development either. The presence of a fine <b>inert</b> alumina <b>powder</b> increases the rate of early hydration of Portland cement. The greater the fineness, the faster the rate of hydration heat development. This reactivity leads to an increase in the compressive strength at early age for mortar containing the finest alumina powders. In case of coarse alumina powder, no acceleration effect is obtained. Finely ground limestone (calcite) fillers promote heterogeneous nucleation of hydrates which significantly accelerates hydration. At early age, this also results in an increased mortar compressive strength in comparison with the control mortar. From the obtained results, it is clear that both chemical natures as well as fineness are important with regard to the accelerating effect of the hydration process. With increasing fineness, the accelerating effect increases. For powders with comparable fineness, it is clear that limestone powder has a more significant accelerating effect than silica fume and alumina filler. Quartzite filler seems to have no significant effect...|$|R
