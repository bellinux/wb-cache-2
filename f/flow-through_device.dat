40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new dynamic mode of {{generating}} bioanalytical arrays based on ultrasonic trapping of microbeads in microfluidic systems. As compared to disposable glass slide microarrays, the proposed technology utilises exchangeable microbeads as the solid phase on which bioassays are performed. The use of microbeads in biochemical analysis is advantageous {{due to the}} increased surface area and thus the high binding capacity as compared to planar solid surfaces. By the integration of ultrasonic microtransducers in a microfluidic system, we have proved {{that it is possible}} to trap and manipulate microbead clusters by making use of acoustic standing wave forces. Functionalised microbeads have been trapped and moved between well-defined positions in a microchannel, thus for the first time showing trapping of microbeads within a <b>flow-through</b> <b>device</b> with individually controlled trapping sites in an array format. A device with three acoustic trapping sites was fabricated and evaluated. The lateral extension of each trapping site was essentially determined by the corresponding microtransducer dimensions, 0. 8 x 0. 8 mm 2. The flow-through volume was approximately 1 µl and the active trapping site volumes about 100 nl each. The strength of trapping was investigated, showing that 50 % of the initially trapped beads were still trapped at a perfusion rate of 10 µl/min. Since the beads determine the chemical functionality in the device a high degree of flexibility is expected.

Effectiveness of the approach is presented through numerical simulations and empirical results on electroporation efficiency and cell viability against various flow rates (exposure time to the field) as well as frequencies and root-mean-square (rms) intensities of the field. High frequencies (80 - 400 kHz) and high intensities (e. g., 1. 6 kV/cm, rms) are identified with increased electroporation efficiency 61 % and viability 86 % on average.

40|$|In {{the work}} to design and {{optimize}} new aftertreatment system devices for NOx reduction and particulate matter removal in lean engine exhaust (such as diesel exhaust), it is of great help {{to be able to}} perform quick, robust and reliable computer simulations of system performance. A suitable platform for such simulations is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The work within this thesis deals with such simulations. A promising technique for the reduction of NOx in lean engine exhaust is the urea-SCR system. The influence of the most common plausible modeling choices in CFD-simulations of urea-SCR systems has been assessed. It has been shown that modeling choices may affect the predicted extent of wall hit, which types of droplets that are predicted to hit the wall, and most possibly also the outcome of wall-wetting if a wall film model is to be employed. The influence of the lift force, the thermophoretic force and the history force was shown to be negligible. It was also shown {{how difficult it is to}} account for turbulent dispersion effects, as the random walk models commonly used together with two-equation turbulence models are very sensitive to deviations from isotropic turbulence. Removal of particulate matter from the exhaust can be accomplished with a wall-flow or a flow-through filter. A mathematical model for an arbitrary flow-through filter has been assembled. The model has been used to determine the particle trapping efficiency of a metallic substrate with protrusions. It was found that – due to the interaction of two dominating particle trapping mechanisms – there exists a minimum in particle trapping efficiency for intermediate sized-particles (150 nm) in this device. These interacting trapping mechanisms are Brownian diffusion (mainly affecting the smallest particles) and inertial impaction (mainly affecting the largest particles). The fact that different sized particles are captured by different mechanisms also reflects in that different sized particles are trapped in different regions of the filter. Whereas the trapping of small particles is increased with a lowering of the gas flow velocity (due to an increased retention time), the trend is reversed for large particles (due to a decreased system response time). Medium-sized particles are least influenced by changes in gas flow velocity. The proposed model can be used for design optimization of <b>flow-through</b> <b>devices</b> for trapping of particulate matter...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 There is {{a growing}} need for sensitive, simple, {{affordable}} and rapid detection of infectious disease biomarkers for faster access to test results and improved patient outcomes. The development of rapid, portable and accurate POC clinical diagnostic devices could lower transmission rates, especially in cases of recent HIV infection in Resource Limited Settings (RLS) by providing timely access to intervention. Self-powered assays will be affordable, dependable and efficient for RLS with minimal user training. The clinical impact of HIV rapid testing technologies in patient care will be to achieve earlier, faster infection identification, allowing immediate counseling and treatment using Antiretrovirals (ARVs). In this thesis, we developed an inexpensive and rapid diagnostics module for the capture and enrichment of an analyte from pooled human plasma samples. We have developed a flow-through membrane based system combining covalently conjugated polymer-antibodies and detection conjugates in a simultaneous binding, capture, and detection assay with potential adaptation for low-resource settings. This flow through assay module provides immunocomplex capture and detection of HIV- 1 p 24 antigen on a porous membrane surface for visualization and semi-quantification. We investigated two formats of rapid immunocomplex capture where the visual signal is developed after surface capture of an enzyme detection sandwich and addition of precipitating substrate, and the second, where a signal was directly visualized with gold colloid nanoparticles (AuNPs). This former system was optimized to provide two-step immunocomplex capture and detection for application to HIV- 1 p 24 antigen using a prototype disc <b>device.</b> Using this <b>flow-through</b> system, we detected 10 pg/ml of p 24 antigen in 50 % human plasma as positive signal above background, reproducible with a coefficient of variation of < 10 %.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} means of handling microparticles in microfluidic systems, in particular localized acoustic trapping of microparticles in a <b>flow-through</b> <b>device.</b> Standing ultrasonic waves were generated across a microfluidic channel by ultrasonic microtransducers integrated {{in one of}} the channel walls. Particles in a fluid passing a transducer were drawn to pressure minima in the acoustic field, thereby being trapped and confined at the lateral position of the transducer. The spatial distribution of trapped particles was evaluated and compared with calculated acoustic intensity distributions. The particle trapping was found to be strongly affected by near field pressure variations due to diffraction effects associated with the finite sized transducer element. Since laterally confining radiation forces are proportional to gradients in the acoustic energy density, these near field pressure variations may be used to get strong trapping forces, thus increasing the lateral trapping efficiency of the device. In the experiments, particles were successfully trapped in linear fluid flow rates up to 1 mm/s.

40|$|Determining {{the biomass of}} {{microbial}} plankton {{is central}} to the study of fluxes of energy and materials in aquatic ecosystems. This is typically accomplished by applying proper volume-to-carbon conversion factors to group-specific abundances and biovolumes. A critical step in this approach is the accurate estimation of biovolume from two-dimensional (2 D) data such as those available through conventional microscopy techniques or flow-through imaging systems. This paper describes a simple yet accurate method for the assessment of the biovolume of planktonic microorganisms, which works with any image analysis system allowing for the measurement of linear distances and the estimation of the cross sectional area of an object from a 2 D digital image. The proposed method is based on Archimedes' principle about the relationship between the volume of a sphere and that of a cylinder in which the sphere is inscribed, plus a coefficient of 'unellipticity' introduced here. Validation and careful evaluation of the method are provided using a variety of approaches. The new method proved to be highly precise with all convex shapes characterised by approximate rotational symmetry, and combining it with an existing method specific for highly concave or branched shapes allows covering the great majority of cases with good reliability. Thanks to its accuracy, consistency, and low resources demand, the new method can conveniently be used in substitution of any extant method designed for convex shapes, and can readily be coupled with automated cell imaging technologies, including state-of-the-art <b>flow-through</b> imaging <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an integrated immunoassay platform is crucial for providing diagnostic tools for global health applications. With the emergence of microfluidics, there is an increased focus in addressing this need. While many platforms have been created to successfully complete an immunoassay, they still require bulky external equipment to manipulate fluid within the device. Using technology developed in the BioMiNT lab, we've created an immunoassay platform {{that is capable of}} on-chip pumping and mixing with lateral and vertical-cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT & VCAT respectively) coupled to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). PDMS devices were fabricated, molded and bonded to glass slides adhered with antigen-spotted nitrocellulose pads. Once they are primed with blocking buffer to introduce air bubbles, the devices are actuated with a PZT to drive fluid pumping and mixing. The reagents are pumped into the device serially and after completion, the spotted antigens on the pad become a dark purple hue, indicating an antibody-antigen binding event. For quantitative results, the intensities are evaluated using computer software. Results show that the resulting spot intensities are comparable to an established, optimized microarray platform in one-fifth of the time. We also show that these results cannot be reproduced in a passive or <b>flow-through</b> microfluidic <b>device,</b> indicating that convective mixing is necessary for improved signal intensity.

With the forthcoming development of more advanced microfluidic systems, the integration of actuating elements becomes essential, giving the ability to control and manipulate fluid flow as well as sample or other components. This thesis addresses miniaturisation of piezoceramic actuators, in particular important technological issues when actuators are integrated in microfluidic systems. Thick film multilayer fabrication technology for piezo­ceramics has been further developed, e. g. by introducing techniques for integration of microfabricated channel structures and via interconnects in multilayer components. New building techniques have been incorporated to allow miniaturisation of devices. A rapid prototyping technique for advanced multilayer actuators based on mechanical machining has also been developed and used in subsequent work. When interfacing the macro and the micro world in miniaturised chemical analysis systems, non-contact sample dispensing methods such as ink-jet technology are needed. Thus a piezoactuated flow-through microdispenser, suitable for high-speed on-line chemical sample handling has been investigated. A new miniaturised actuator has been developed and integrated in the microdispenser, simplifying assembly and demonstrating an improved performance of the device.

40|$|Particles {{within an}} {{ultrasonic}} standing wave experience an acoustic force causing the particles {{to move to}} certain positions within the acoustic field. This phenomenon {{can be used to}} manipulate particles and so provides a means to separate, concentrate or trap particles, cells or spores. The work described is applied to a micro-engineered <b>flow-through</b> <b>device</b> for processing small samples and incorporates a fluid filled chamber of depth typically between 100 and 200 ?m, and therefore approaches microfluidic dimensions. The successful design and subsequent performance of such devices rely on the predictability of particle trajectories which are influenced predominantly by acoustic and fluid flow fields. Therefore, the majority of this research seeks an {{understanding of the nature of}} these fields and, in turn, reliable simulation of particle trajectories. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling is used to develop a robust 2 -dimensional model of the device’s microchannels and is used to predict the presence of eddy regions, associated with the etch fabrication techniques, which are likely to disrupt the separation process. Based on a geometric study, simulations and subsequent test results on a fabricated device have revealed geometric modifications which minimise these eddy flows and promote the existence of laminar flow within the main channel of the device. Finite element analysis (FEA) provides a method to investigate the 2 -dimensional characteristics of the acoustic field and reveals variations in acoustic pressure across the width of the device, giving rise to lateral radiation forces frequently reported in similar ultrasonic devices. This work investigates acoustic enclosure modes in 2 or 3 -dimensions as a possible cause of these lateral variations, with modelled results matching well with experiment. A particle force model has also been developed which predicts the motion of particles through the device, and by which concentration and separation performance may be calculated. This tool is used to investigate acoustic design, operating conditions and separation performance for both the micro-engineered device and a device based on a quarter-wavelength, providing valuable insight into various trends observed. The novelty in this work is the application of macro-scale numerical techniques to microengineered ultrasonic particle manipulators and the execution of an extensive analysis of the design and operation of such devices. These analyses have demonstrated, and therefore have explained, various phenomena associated with the fluid and acoustic fields, and how they influence particle separation performance.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the weathering of silicate minerals by both purely inorganic, and biologically mediated processes using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDS). By resolving surface textures and chemical compositions of weathered surfaces at the sub-micron scale we {{hope to be able to}} distinguish abiotic from biotic weathering processes and so establish a new biosignature applicable to the study of astromaterials including but not limited to the Martian meteorites. Sterilized olivine grains (San Carlos, Arizona) no more than 1 - 2 mm in their longest dimension were optically assayed to be uniform in color and free of inclusions were selected as weathering subjects. Prior to all experiments surface morphologies and Fe/Mg ratios were determined for each grain using FE-SEM and EDS. Experiments were divided into two categories abiotic and biotic and were compared with "naturally" weathered samples. For the preliminary experiments, two trials (open and closed to the ambient laboratory environment) were performed under abiotic conditions, and three trials under biotic conditions (control, day 1 and day 2). The open system abiotic trials used sterile grains heated at 98 C and 200 C for both 24 and 48 hours in 1 L double distilled de-ionized water. The closed system abiotic trials were conducted under the same conditions but in a sealed two layer steel/Teflon "bomb" apparatus. The biotic trials used sterile grains mounted in a <b>flow-through</b> <b>device</b> attached to a wellhead on the Columbia River aquifer. Several discolored, altered, grains were selected to document "natural" weathering surface textures for comparison with the experimental samples. Preliminary results indicate there are qualitative differences in weathered surface textures among all the designed experiments. The olivine grains in abiotic trials displayed etching, pitting, denticulate margins, dissolution and clay formation. The scale of the features ranged from tens to a few microns with textures that remained relatively sharp and were crystallographically controlled. These results were comparable to that observed in the "naturally" weathered comparison/reference grains. Chemical analysis by EDS indicates these textures correlated with the relative loss of Mg and Fe cations by diffusional processes. In contrast the biotic results indicated changes in the etching patterns on the scale of hundreds of nm, which are neither sharp nor crystallographically controlled (nanoetching). Organisms, organic debris and/or extracellular polymeric substances (biofilm) were often in close proximity or direct contact with the nanoetching. While there are many poorly constrained variables in natural weathering experiments to contend with, such as the time scale, the chemistry of the fluids and degree of biologic participation, some preliminary observations can be made: (1) certain distinct surface textures appear correlated with the specific processes giving rise to these textures; (2) the process of diffusing cations can produce many similar styles of surface textural changes; and (3) the main difference between abiotic and biotically produced weathering is the scale (microns versus nanometers) and the style (crystallographically versus noncrystallographically controlled) of the textural features. Further investigation into nanosize scale surface textures should attempt to quantify both textures and chemical changes of the role of microorganisms in the weathering of silicates.

The 145 cm-long microchannel is appropriately designed to cross the alternating temperature zones as many times as necessary for the DNA sample to perform 30 PCR cycles. Numerical computations lead the design so that there is no thermal crosstalk between the 3 zones of our chip and indicate excellent temperature uniformity in each zone. In addition, the total power consumption during the chip operation is calculated to be in the order of a few Watts, verified experimentally by means of thermal characterization of our heaters. Thermal camera measurements also verified the excellent temperature uniformity in the three thermal zones. An external, home-made temperature control system was utilized to maintain the heater temperatures in the designated values (± 0. 2 °C). The PCR chip was validated by a successful amplification of a 90 base-pairs DNA template of the mouse GAPDH housekeeping gene within 5 min. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|A 2. 0 cm {{internal}} diameter 1 m long, axially-rotating horizontal glass tube, with four axially located repeating hybrid magnetic units, {{is used as}} part of a flow-through, colloidal magnetic affinity separation device. Each magnetic unit consists of an alternating current solenoid surrounding the chamber followed by four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets that rotate with the chamber. The separation is demonstrated on a model feed system consisting of a mixture of 1. 0 μm diameter biotinylated latex beads (targets) and 9. 7 μm diameter non-functionalized latex beads (non-targets) at a 1 : 1 number ratio. Two feed flow rates of 12 ml/min and 35 ml/min were used until a total of 600 ml of sample were processed for each. At the low rate we achieved capture efficiency 60 %, a separation factor of 18. 2 with 95 % purity. For the higher flow rate, the capture efficiency was 40 %, the separation factor 18. 6 with 87 % purity. ^ The same device also was used for removal of cadmium ions from a cadmium sulfate solution. Two arrangements for the magnetic units were used. In the first configuration, four hybrid pairs were distributed axially—each pair consisted of an alternating current carrying solenoid, followed by four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets that rotate with the chamber. In the second configuration, all four solenoids were placed first, followed by the four sets of four azimuthally distributed permanent magnets. 1 – 10 μm diameter magnetic particles with iron oxide nanoparticles embedded within a quaternary ammonium cellulose matrix (MagaCell-Q, Cortex Biochem) at a starting concentration of 0. 5 mg particles/mL were used as the mobile solid support. The feed consisted of a 10. 0 mg/L cadmium sulfate solution, at a flow rate of 35 mL/min. For the arrangement, the cadmium concentration at the exit of the third stage dropped to 0. 97 mg/L. The second configuration produced a final cadmium concentration of 0. 68 mg/L. For the first arrangement, three stage processing resulted in an overall ∼ 90 % w/w cadmium removal, and the second configuration removed ∼ 94 % of the original cadmium ions. The operating mode of this device requires a periodic interruption of the feed flow, leading to down time. Thus there is a compelling motivation {{to the development of the}} continuous device. ^ The continuous, hybrid magnetic field gradient separation device, designed in our lab, incorporates a 1. 0 cm {{internal diameter}} 1 m long, axially-rotating horizontal glass tube, with four axially located repeating magnetic units. Each magnetic unit consists of an alternating current solenoid surrounding the chamber followed by electromagnets at a distance of 4. 0 cm from the end of the solenoid. A computer controlled DC current flowing in the electromagnet is used to generate radial magnetic field gradients within the tube, allowing magnetic particles to be drawn to the walls. MagaCell-Q magnetic particles were used to demonstrate the removal of cadmium ions from an aqueous solution. Three stage processing resulted in an overall ∼ 92 % cadmium removal. Thus, this breakthrough technology in continuous separation can lead to a large increase in processing volume and reduced down time compared to the <b>flow-through</b> <b>device,</b> without loss of removal efficiency. ^ While the specific system studied here consists of removal of cadmium ions from an aqueous solution, the general principle of magnetic colloidal separation using the flow-through and continuous devices can be exploited for other environmental and biotechnological applications where large volumes of sample must be processed with high efficiency. ...|$|E

Advances inmicrofluidic chip technology promise to integrate andminiaturize multiple lab processes into a single palm-sizeddevice. The advantages of these lab-on-a-chip devices,sometimes also referred to as micro total analysis systems(µTAS), compared with conventional bench-scale systems arenumerous and wide ranging and include: less reagentconsumption, low manufacturing costs, increased performance,faster analysis, high sample throughput, integration andautomation possibilities, and disposability. However,microfluidic devices also present challenges such as theinterfacing to the macro world and detection limits. In this thesis the focus has been to develop novel discretemicrofluidic components for biotechnology and organic chemicalapplications with the goal to integrate them to formlab-on-chips.

It {{has been found that}} Joule heating could raise the intra-channel temperature up to cytotoxic levels (> 45 °C) only when conditions of low flow rates and high applied voltages are applied. Nevertheless, when flow rates and electric fields are set to those used in real electroporation experiments we have found that local heating is not larger than a few degrees, i. e. temperature is kept within the safe range (< 32 °C). We also provide thermal images of electroporation devices from which the heat affected area can be elucidated. Experimental data {{have been found to be}} in excellent agreement with numerical simulations that have also revealed the presence of a non-homogeneous temperature distribution along the electroporation channel whose magnitude is critically dependent on both applied electric field and flow rate.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a systematic study of the parameters affecting dialysis procedures, including active (Donnan) dialysis and electrodialysis, for the pretreatment of alkaline samples prior to ion chromatographic analysis. A preliminary study of enrichment of inorganic anions using an "Elutrap" apparatus is also presented. Dialysis methods were investigated with a view to applying membrane-based clean-up procedures to the determination of trace levels of inorganic anions in various samples following sample treatment by hydroxide fusion. Donnan dialysis was carried out by passing sodium hydroxide solutions containing inorganic anions through a cation-exchange hollow fibre immersed in a hydrogen ion donating medium. As the sample is passed through the lumen of the fibre, a dialysis reaction involving exchange of sodium ions in the sample with hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium occurs, resulting in total or partial neutralization of the sample. Several acid solutions including slurries of cation-exchange resins were evaluated on the basis of neutralization efficiency and penetration of the acid anion through the membrane. Cation-exchange resins in the hydrogen form slurried with 0. 1 M octanesulfonic acid gave optimal performance and when the resin was stirred occasionally the total theoretical neutralization capacity of the resin was achieved. The use of an "Elutrap" apparatus was shown in this study to be impractical for sample clean-up and enrichment of anions. However, factors affecting the migration rate of inorganic anions under applied DC potential have been elucidated. An electrodialysis process, which uses an electrical field to stimulate the migration of ions through the membrane, was studied for off-line neutralization of strongly alkaline samples. This method utilizes an electrodialysis cell comprising three compartments separated from each other by cation-exchange membranes. Experimental parameters, such as the magnitude of the applied current or power, the type of cation-exchange membrane used and the design of the cell were studied. Under optimal conditions, recoveries of solute anions (Cl -, Br, NO 3 -, HPO 42 - and SO 42 - in the range 3 - 10 lig/m 1) from 1 M NaOH solution were close to quantitative except for fluoride and nitrite. It is suggested that low recoveries for these ions were due to the formation of neutral, protonated species within the membrane with subsequent loss by diffusion. A <b>flow-through</b> electrodialysis <b>device,</b> in which the sample was allowed to flow during the dialysis process, was studied for the on-line pretreatment of strongly alkaline solutions. Variations of the shape of the sample compartments {{and the size of the}} electrodes were studied in order to optimize the flow-through cell design and to minimize the heat generated inside the cell. Quantitative recovery for fluoride ion could be achieved using a Neosepta CMS cation-exchange membrane and the ability to successfully treat samples containing fluoride represented an improvement over the off-line cell. The on-line electrodialysis method has been successfully applied to the determination of inorganic anions in vegetation samples obtained from the vicinity of an aluminium smelter, following sample preparation by hydroxide fusion. This work demonstrated that when correctly applied, the method could be used on different sample types which have been traditionally difficult to analyse by ion chromatography...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{standing}} waves {{can be used}} to generate radiation forces which act on particles within a fluid. These forces may be useful for manipulation, separation, or fractionation of these particles. This thesis describes the use and modelling of a number of devices which use such acoustic radiation forces. Initially, the design and testing of a large (multiple wavelength) <b>flow-through</b> ultrasonic separation <b>device</b> is described. This device demonstrated {{for the first time that}} flow-through ultrasonic filtration could be made to work successfully on this scale without having to rely on acoustically transparent membranes. Three models are used to examine the behaviour of the resonator. The electro-acoustic model is then used to analyse the performance of two smaller resonators and is shown to match experimental values well. The model is used to explain the behaviour of the resonators in the regions where individual layers of the device themselves have thickness resonances at similar frequencies. It also demonstrates the importance of the bonding between layers and shows that the standing wave at a peak of the energy density response differs, in terms of nodal position and boundary impedance, from simple, rigid-rigid boundary models. The remainder of the thesis concentrates on the design and use of micro-scale devices in which the scale of the layers is similar to or smaller than the wavelengths in use. A novel microfabricated filtration device is described which is primarily constructed using silicon and Pyrex. The modelling, design, fabrication and initial testing of the device are discussed. An expanded version of the electro-acoustic model allows prediction of the radiation forces on an example particle within a standing wave field. This is used to examine the force profile on a particle at resonances with pressure nodes at different positions. An analytical method for predicting modal conditions for combinations of frequencies and layer thickness characteristics is presented, which predicts that resonances can exist that will produce a pressure node at arbitrary positions in the fluid layer of such a system. The model also predicts conditions for multiple sub-wavelength resonances within the fluid layer of a single resonator, each resonance having different nodal planes for particle concentration. This forms the basis for the design of a unique microfabricated resonator with several modes that allow particles to be forced to either boundary of the fluid or to the fluid centre, depending on the operating frequency.

40|$|Genetic and {{epigenetic}} {{analyses of}} cells are powerful tools broadly applicable to clinical diagnosis, drug screening, forensic identification, food safety inspection, environmental monitoring and biowarfare testing. The translation of conventional analytical techniques using macroscale apparatus to microfluidic chip format offers {{the advantages of}} enhanced sensitivity and speed, decreased the potential sample cross-contamination and product loss, reduced sample and reagent consumption, favorable fluidic properties, low cost, and disposability. This dissertation presents the development of several microfluidic chips {{that are capable of}} analyzing and manipulating cells for genetic or epigenetic studies. ^ Histone modifications are important epigenetic mechanisms involved in eukaryotic gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay serves as the prime technique to characterize the genomic locations associated with histone modifications. However, traditional tube-based ChIP assays rely on large numbers of cells as well as laborious and time-consuming procedures. I first demonstrate a novel microfluidics-based ChIP assay which dramatically reduced the required cell number and the assay time by conducting cell collection, cell lysis, chromatin fragmentation, immunoprecipitation, and washing on a microchip. Coupled with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the assay permitted the analysis of histone modifications from as few as ∼ 50 cells within 8. 5 h. The results indicate that the method will provide a new approach for analysis of epigenetic regulations and protein-DNA interactions in general based on scarce cell samples. ^ Electrical lysis based on irreversible electroporation is a promising technique for genetic analysis due to its fast speed and reagentless procedure. However, knowledge on DNA extraction from electrically lysed samples is still lacking. To address this challenge, I constructed a novel integrated microfluidic chip capable of performing sample preparation for genetic analysis. The microchip was able to physically trap a given amount of cells, lyse the cells in 1. 5 min using 10 square direct current (DC) electrical pulses, as well as purify and concentrate genomic DNA. Efficient integration of the three key steps successfully generated sufficient products amenable to off-chip real-time PCR assay from as few as ∼ 30 mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells and 102 colony-forming units (CFU) of Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium. DNA yield exhibited a great dependency on electrical field intensity and a good linearity with respect to the amount of bacterial cells. I envision that the device will be fully integrated with PCR assays and quantitative detection techniques to implement a total analysis system with sample-in-answer-out capability. ^ In addition, I present a strategy for active modulation of DNA adsorption and desorption on silica beads in an electrically actuated microfluidic chip by varying the buffer pH through electrolysis of water. This technique provides a novel method for DNA purification and concentration in a low ionic strength buffer, which eliminates the utilization of harsh chemicals typically involved in traditional DNA extraction procedure. ^ Genetic modification of cells is a critical step involved in functional gene studies. However, the throughput of current transfection methods is limited. In the final chapter, I present a novel flow-through electroporation method for delivery of genes into cells at high flow rates (up to ∼ 20 ml/min) based on disposable microfluidic chips, a syringe pump, and a low-cost DC power supply that provides a constant voltage. By eliminating pulse generators used in conventional electroporation, the method dramatically lowered the cost of the apparatus and improved the stability and consistency of the electroporation field for long-time operation. I tested the delivery of pEGFP-C 1 plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein into CHO-K 1 cells in the devices of various dimensions and geometries. Cells were mixed with plasmids and then flowed through a fluidic channel continuously while a constant voltage was established across the device. Together with the applied voltage, the geometry and dimensions of the fluidic channel determined the electrical parameters of the electroporation. With the optimal design, ∼ 75 % of the viable CHO-K 1 cells were transfected after the procedure. I also generalize the guidelines for scaling up these <b>flow-through</b> electroporation <b>devices.</b> This technique will serve as a generic and low-cost tool for a variety of biological applications requiring large volume of transfected cells. ...|$|R
