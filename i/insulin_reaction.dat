50|$|Glucose is a {{ubiquitous}} fuel in biology. It {{is used as}} {{an energy}} source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g. starch) yields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis {{and later in the}} reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form CO2 and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of ATP. The <b>insulin</b> <b>reaction,</b> and other mechanisms, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood.|$|E

Aim: To study the impact of control of diabetes on the pattern of cutaneous disorders. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study of patients attending diabetic clinic in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 500 consecutive patients were studied. Detailed history, clinical examination and relevant investigations were done to diagnose diabetic complications and cutaneous disorders. Dermatoses with or without known pathogenesis were correlated with age, gender, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), duration of diabetes, and complications of DM. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student "t" test and Chi-square test with 5 % confidence interval (P value 0. 05). Results: Majority of patients had well-controlled (FPG 0. 05) between the patients with or without DM specific cutaneous disorders was noticed with reference to age and gender distribution, duration of DM and FPG. Signs of insulin resistance, acrochordon (26. 2 %), and acanthosis nigricans (5 %) were common, followed by fungal (13. 8 %) and bacterial (6. 8 %) infections.

For the complexes with weak proneness to self-association PcHfDbm 2, PcHfPyr 2, and PcHfBtfa 2 {{the values of}} inhibitory activity were estimated as 60 – 73 %. For phthalocyanines with the pronounced tendency to self-association PcHfPiromelit and PcHfCl 2 the noticeably higher inhibitory activity values (about 95 %) were shown.

Informed {{consent was obtained}} from all parents. Blood samples were taken before, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the start of therapy and, thereafter, at monthly intervals for 2 years. Insulin (auto) antibodies (I(A) A) were measured by radio binding assay (RBA) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IAA, determined by RBA, were detected in eight children.

40|$|Background and aims: Since {{treatment}} with insulin detemir {{results in a}} lower weight gain compared to human insulin, we investigated whether detemir is associated with lower ability to promote adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis in human adipose stem cells (ASC). Methods and results: Human ASC isolated from both the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were differentiated for 30 days {{in the presence of}} human insulin or insulin detemir. Nile Red and Oil-Red-O staining were used to quantify the rate of ASC conversion to adipocytes and lipid accumulation, respectively. mRNA expression levels of early genes, including Fos and Cebpb, as well as of lipogenic and adipogenic genes, were measured at various phases of differentiation by qRT-PCR. Activation of insulin signaling was assessed by immunoblotting. ASC isolated from subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were less differentiated when exposed to insulin detemir compared to human insulin, showing lower rates of adipocyte conversion, reduced triglyceride accumulation, and impaired expression of late-phase adipocyte marker genes, such as Pparg 2, Slc 2 a 4, Adipoq, and Cidec. However, no differences in activation of insulin receptor, Akt and Erk and induction of the early genes Fos and Cebpb were observed between insulin detemir and human insulin.

After 60 min of association at 37 degrees C, 90 % of specifically bound insulin could be dissociated from the cells; this fraction remained unaltered under steady-state conditions (up to 180 min). To assess the nature of cell-associated radioactivity, cardiocytes were solubilized and filtered on Sephadex G- 50. After 5 min of association only intact insulin was observed, whereas under steady-state conditions 4 % of 125 I-labelled insulin bound to the cells was degraded to iodotyrosine-containing fragments.

25|$|If beta {{cells are}} {{destroyed}} by an autoimmune <b>reaction,</b> <b>insulin</b> {{can no longer}} be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting. In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive and peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood glucose. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose. As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons. There are a variety of treatment regimens, none of which is entirely satisfactory. When the pancreas’s capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds, insulin injections are given.|$|R

This <b>reaction</b> is carried out by the NADPH-dependent type 1 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD 1), an enzyme attached through an integral N-terminal transmembrane helix to the lipid bilayer and located with its active site within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

This variant was determined in complex with NADP at 2. 5 A resolution and crystallized in the presence of detergent and guanidinium hydrochloride. The overall structure of guinea pig 11 beta-HSD 1 shows a clear relationship to other members of the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases but harbors a unique C-terminal helical segment that fulfills three essential functions and accordingly is involved in subunit interactions, contributes to active site architecture, and is necessary for lipid-membrane interactions. The structure provides a model for enzyme-lipid bilayer interactions and suggests a funneling of lipophilic substrates such as steroid hormones from the hydrophobic membrane environment to the enzyme active site...|$|R
5000|$|If {{pancreatic}} beta {{cells are}} destroyed by an autoimmune <b>reaction,</b> <b>insulin</b> {{can no longer}} be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting. In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive and peripheral tissue insulin resistance [...] Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood glucose. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose. As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons. There are a variety of treatment regimens, none of which is entirely satisfactory. When the pancreas’s capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds, insulin injections are given.|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{signalling}} pathways {{were investigated}} in a 33 year-old woman with immunologic insulin resistance. Her past medical history was remarkable for intermittent use of <b>insulin</b> and allergic <b>reactions</b> to several drugs, and measure of plasma anti-insulin antibodies level corroborated the clinical suspicion of immune mediated insulin resistance (8074 nU/ml - RIA - Ref value: < 60). Treatment with several immunosuppressive regimens was tried, however {{the results were}} disappointing. Possible subcellular mechanisms of insulin resistance were investigated by performing analysis of insulin receptor and post receptor signaling in skeletal muscle biopsy. The expression of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT- 4) was evaluated in total extract from muscle tissue by Western blotting. Basal IR, IRS- 1 and GLUT- 4 expression was detected, however receptor autophosphorylation was not observed. A study of translocation of GLUT- 4 to plasma membrane showed that tissue presented low levels of membrane-associated GLUT- 4. When in vitro stimulation was undertaken, tissue was capable to be responsive to insulin. Our results suggest that even though IR expression was normally occurring, IR β-subunit tyrosine kinase activity in muscle was down-regulated leading to alterations in insulin post receptor signaling. Consistent with normal insulin receptor and post receptor signaling, our results were compatible with decreased insulin binding to IR probably due to neutralization by anti-insulin antibodies. In conclusion, this patient has immunologic insulin resistance and treatment {{should be based on}} immunosuppressive drugs as tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Islet amyloid {{polypeptide}} (IAPP), or 'amylin', is co-stored with insulin in secretory granules of {{pancreatic islet}} beta-cells. In Type 2 diabetes, IAPP converts into a beta-sheet conformation and oligomerizes to form amyloid fibrils and islet deposits. Granule components, including insulin, inhibit spontaneous IAPP fibril formation in vitro. To determine {{the mechanism of}} this inhibition, molecular interactions of insulin with human IAPP (hIAPP), rat IAPP (rIAPP) and other peptides were examined using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore), CD and transmission electron microscopy (EM). hIAPP and rIAPP complexed with <b>insulin,</b> and this <b>reaction</b> was concentration-dependent. rIAPP and insulin, but not pro-insulin, bound to hIAPP. Insulin with a truncated B-chain, to prevent dimerization, also bound hIAPP. In the presence of insulin, hIAPP did not spontaneously develop beta-sheet secondary structure or form fibrils. Insulin interacted with pre-formed IAPP fibrils in a regular repeating pattern, as demonstrated by immunoEM, suggesting that the binding sites for insulin remain exposed in hIAPP fibrils. Since rIAPP and hIAPP form complexes with insulin (and each other), this could explain the lack of amyloid fibrils in transgenic mice expressing hIAPP. It is likely that IAPP fibrillogenesis is inhibited in secretory granules (where the hIAPP concentration is in the millimolar range) by heteromolecular complex formation with insulin. Alterations in the proportions of insulin and IAPP in granules could disrupt {{the stability of the}} peptide. The increase in the proportion of unprocessed pro-insulin produced in Type 2 diabetes could be a major factor in destabilization of hIAPP and induction of fibril formation...|$|R
40|$|Taurine is a conditionally {{essential}} amino acid for human that {{is involved in the}} control of glucose homeostasis; however, the mechanisms by which the amino acid affects blood glucose levels are unknown. Using an animal model, we have studied these mechanisms. Mice were supplemented with taurine for 30 d. Blood glucose homeostasis was assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Islet cell function was determined by insulin secretion, cytosolic Ca 2 + measurements and glucose metabolism from isolated islets. Islet cell gene expression and translocation was examined via immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain <b>reaction.</b> <b>Insulin</b> signaling was studied by Western blot. Islets from taurine-supplemented mice had: (i) significantly higher insulin content, (ii) increased insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose concentrations, (iii) significantly displaced the dose-response curve for glucose-induced insulin release to the left, (iv) increased glucose metabolism at 5. 6 and 11. 1 -mmol/L concentrations; (v) slowed cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) oscillations in response to stimulatory glucose concentrations; (vi) increased insulin, sulfonylurea receptor- 1, glucokinase, Glut- 2, proconvertase and pancreas duodenum homeobox- 1 (PDX- 1) gene expression and (vii) increased PDX- 1 expression in the nucleus. Moreover, taurine supplementation significantly increased both basal and insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in skeletal muscle and liver tissues. Finally, taurine supplemented mice showed an improved IPGTT. These results indicate that taurine controls glucose homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, taurine enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
