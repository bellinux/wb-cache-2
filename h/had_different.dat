5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they <b>had</b> <b>different</b> views on {{traditional}} culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often <b>had</b> <b>different</b> owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E

5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have <b>had</b> <b>different</b> ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E

5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum.

Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, <b>had</b> <b>different</b> flags to carry into battle. The flags served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on their backs and horses. Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.|$|E

5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee.

Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
