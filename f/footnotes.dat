5|$|The Epistles of Clement of {{the codex}} were {{published}} in 1633 by Patrick Young, the Royal Librarian. A collation was made by Alexander Huish, Prebendary of Wells, for the London Polyglot Bible (1657). The text of the manuscript was cited as <b>footnotes.</b> Richard Bentley made a collation in 1675.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, {{such as those of}} Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 <b>footnotes,</b> outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.|$|E

5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own <b>footnotes</b> in Greek.|$|E
5|$|Suggesting {{the passing}} of a single day, The Loves of the Plants is divided into four cantos, all written in heroic couplets. A preface to the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader through the garden is a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory <b>footnotes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his inbox and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added <b>footnotes</b> to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of its notable players, {{generally}} {{this means}} players that have played 100 or more first-class matches for the club. However, some players who have played fewer matches are also included; players from the club's pre-Football League days, when they played fewer matches in a season than the present day, and club captains are included. Players who hold club records have <b>footnotes</b> describing the record. Players are listed according to the date of their first-team debut for the club. Appearances are for first-team competitive matches only including those as a substitute; wartime matches are excluded.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in <b>footnotes</b> the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|With his {{business}} background, he helped oversee many church operations, including KSL Newsradio and Bonneville International. He {{was chairman of}} the Scripture Publication Committee in the 1970s that oversaw publication of the LDS Church edition of the King James Bible, and revised editions of church scriptures containing <b>footnotes</b> and guides. He also oversaw the church's Printing Advisory, Missionary Executive, and General Welfare committees. While an apostle, he continued his education and received a master of business administration degree from Brigham Young University in 1974.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to its sometimes-humorous commentaries on baseball, the article is a parody of the style in which law review articles are generally written, such as their sometimes overly-formal wording and their often-excessive use of <b>footnoting.</b> The very first word of the article, [...] "The", is supported by an unnecessary citation to the Oxford English Dictionary. The second time the word [...] "the" [...] appears, another <b>footnote</b> appears (<b>footnote</b> 4), which merely refers {{back to the first}} <b>footnote.</b> A more complex example of parody appears when the text refers to a late-19th century baseball player who was said to have [...] "the speed of an ice wagon," [...] followed by a <b>footnote</b> stating: [...] "Raised by this statement is the issue of the speed of an ice wagon in both relative and absolute terms. Such inquiry {{is beyond the scope of}} this Aside." ...|$|R
50|$|In English, a <b>footnote</b> is {{normally}} flagged by a superscripted number immediately following {{that portion of}} the text the note references, each such <b>footnote</b> being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: 1.|$|R
5|$|You {{are serving}} many masters, and inevitably you are {{compromise}}d. The man speaks and you listen {{but you do}} not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, <b>footnotes,</b> italics, dashes....|$|E
5|$|In the <b>footnotes</b> to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards {{correlated}} the subfossil {{species with}} parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot therein. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory <b>footnotes</b> such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|Potter's small format {{books have}} been {{translated}} into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes {{was published in the}} Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1966 and in Dutch as Het Verhaal van Timmie Tuimelaar in 1968 under licence to Uitgeverij Ploegsma, Amsterdam. The tale was published in Spanish by Grange Books in 1997, and a German Thesaurus edition intended for German ESL and English GSL students in 2009. The Thesaurus edition was printed in English with translations of difficult or unusual words and expressions located in <b>footnotes.</b> In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages (two {{other books}} {{mentioned}} in the Harry Potter novels that have also been printed) the standard and collector's editions of The Tales of Beedle the Bard feature commentary and <b>footnotes</b> from Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts {{and one of the}} main characters of the series. The standard edition also includes illustrations reproduced from the handwritten edition auctioned in December 2007 and the introduction by the author. The limited collector's edition features ten illustrations by J.K. Rowling not included in the standard edition or the original handcrafted edition, as well as an exclusive reproduction of J.K. Rowling's handwritten introduction, and other miscellaneous objects such as replica gemstones and an emerald ribbon.|$|E
5|$|The First Folio text of 1623 {{was based}} {{primarily}} on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions {{first appeared in the}} Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with <b>footnotes</b> describing the sources and culture behind the play.|$|E
