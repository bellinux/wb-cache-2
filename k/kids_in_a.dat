She found the role in Kunal Kohli's Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic (2008), a children's film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled <b>kids.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> {{particularly}} scathing review, Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji's choice of roles and wrote, [...] "As a Geeta Poppins, she's one-dimensional, either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls. Her costumes, too, are uneasy-on-the-eyes". The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji's career prospects.

2500|$|A {{majority}} of the band's previous material was written by former guitarist Ryan Ross. For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself. But it ended up being great, and I’m glad {{that we were able to}} figure out what we wanted to write about." [...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and messing around with them. It was two <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> candy store… and we listened to Arcade Fire's The Suburbs on repeat for me for the past… well, since it came out [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Oakland Zoo was {{independently}} {{formed by}} Pitt {{students in the}} winter of 2001. The initial idea for the Zoo came from Matt Cohen and Zach Hale during the January 6, 2001 basketball game against Syracuse where they determined the Pitt student section was too calm. Cohen and Hale, rounded up eight of their fellow students from the university's Litchfield Towers dormitory to initiate the club first appearance at the [...] January 13, 2001 victory over then 15th-ranked Seton Hall. The name [...] "Zoo" [...] was meant to represent [...] "a bunch of <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zoo acting crazy" [...] whereas [...] "Oakland" [...] is the neighborhood of Pittsburgh in which the university resides. Students adopted gold t-shirts and eventually grew to consume the majority of the student section at the team's home court then inside Fitzgerald Field House. [...] Originally, upon seeking official sponsorship from the University for the 2001-2002 season, the group was denied and the athletic department attempted to implement their own [...] counterpart to their football student cheering section called the [...] "Aero-Zone", named after then athletic department apparel sponsor Aéropostale, and issued free t-shirts to the students emblazoned with this name. [...] However, the [...] "Aero-Zone" [...] failed to catch on while the Oakland Zoo continued to grow, transitioning into the Petersen Events Center when it was opened in 2002 and filling the larger student section of the [...] "Pete". [...] The group is now an officially recognized student group of the University, and with over 2,000 members, is the largest such group.|$|E

With Homer giving all his {{attention}} to other kids, Bart and Lisa feel neglected as Homer ignores them, gives Bart's jacket to Milhouse, forces {{them out of their}} bedrooms for a film crew that is making a documentary about him, and has them work long hours at night to cut out felt hearts in his honor. The daycare center is wildly successful, and Homer earns a nomination for the [...] "Good Guy Awards". But during a video tribute at the awards ceremony, Bart and Lisa splice in home movie footage of Homer at his worst. The video shows Homer passed out on the floor drunk and almost naked during Christmas, losing Maggie to Moe in a poker game, and chasing Bart down the street while wielding a flail). The audience becomes outraged and Homer angrily strangles Bart on stage. Everyone in the audience becomes horrified by Homer's behavior, and decide to prevent their kids from being watched over by him. Homer escapes from the ceremony with all the <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> van, until he crashes the van into a tree, and tries to escape before Chief Wiggum stops him. After three mistrials, Homer apologizes to Bart and Lisa for neglecting them, and promises to care for his own children (including the perpetually ignored Maggie) instead of the neighborhood kids. The family then helps themselves to the craft table, which the Teamsters left behind in their house but are supposedly picking up later that day.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, {{the rock}} group Evanescence from Arkansas, United States also found {{commercial}} {{success with the}} release of their debut album Fallen. Their style represents a blend of gothic and alternative metal with critics drawing comparisons to other alternative metal acts like P.O.D. and Linkin Park. Further comparisons have since been drawn between Evanescence and gothic metal groups like Within Temptation and Lacuna Coil. Critic Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wryly notes that while Lacuna Coil [...] "had been tirelessly building a fanbase in Europe since the late 1990s with their listener-friendly brand of goth metal", they had been overshadowed by [...] "a bunch of corn-fed kids from Arkansas with a big publicity machine behind them [...] the very sound the Italian sextet had helped pioneer, and present it to the American suburban goth <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much more pop-oriented, dumbed down variation". Cammila Albertson of Allmusic similarly locates Evanescence as one step further from gothic metal, offering the description of the band as [...] "a pop version of an already diluted brand of metal". While Fernando Ribeiro of Moonspell contends that Evanescence is not a metal band, publications such as the New York Times, Rough Guides, Rolling Stone and Blender have nonetheless identified Evanescence as a gothic metal act. Adrian Jackson, former bassist My Dying Bride feels the American group is doing something similar to My Dying Bride music, only in a more commercial direction. Gregor Mackintosh of Paradise Lost notes a generation gap between his group and Evanescence, suggesting that Paradise Lost has only influenced Evanescence indirectly through other acts like Lacuna Coil. The success of Evanescence has been recognized [...] for opening [...] "new grounds" [...] for gothic metal bands to [...] "explore and conquer".|$|E

60|$|Formerly he {{had been}} a merry fellow, fond of a joke, and in the art of cooking had no equal in the town. He could make fish-jelly, and quince fritters, and even wafer-cakes; and he gilded the ears of all his boars' heads. Peter had looked about him for a wife early in life, but unluckily his choice fell upon a woman whose evil tongue was well known in the town. Ilse was hated by everybody, and the young folks would go miles out of their way rather than meet her, for she had some ill-word for everyone. Therefore, when Master Peter came along, and let himself be taken in by her boasted skill as a housewife, she jumped at his offer, and they were married the next day. But they had not got home before they began to quarrel. In the joy of his heart Peter had tasted freely of his own good wine, and as the bride hung upon his arm he {{stumbled}} and fell, dragging her down with him; whereupon she beat him soundly, and the neighbours said truly that things did not promise well for Master Peter's comfort. Even when the ill-matched couple were presently blessed with children, his happiness was but short lived, the savage temper of his quarrelsome wife seemed to blight them from the first, and they died like little <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold winter.|$|E
