5|$|Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works, from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944. The Electricity Supply Commission {{came under}} his portfolio. It had {{responsibility}} for {{ensuring that the}} generation of electricity kept pace with the ever·growing needs of mining, farming and secondary industry. When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at Umsweswe, but kept running short of money. The Minister of Finance, Jacob Smit, was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro-electric scheme. Guest proposed Kariba {{as a source of}} <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> and Smit provided the money for further investigation. Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares, who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed Sinoia/Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba, to survey the area, select a site for a power station and submit a report. When he eventually did so, Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal. They reported favourably but did not recommend that the scheme be proceeded with immediately. Nor was the Cabinet particularly impressed, and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The Galloway <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> {{scheme is}} {{a network of}} dams and <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> {{stations}} in Galloway, south west Scotland. It was built between 1930 and 1936.|$|E

50|$|The 168H (1941) and 268H (1942) Lincoln Customs {{featured}} two models: the Model 31 eight passenger {{sedan and}} the model 32 eight passenger limousine. Differences included a division window and different front seat upholstery for the limousine. Both utilized a three speed transmission with Borg-Warner overdrive. A small number were modified by the few custom coach builders left in the United States before the war. The 1942 models introduced power windows to the luxury car field; electric and <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>powered</b> limousine dividers having previously been offered.|$|R
25|$|Industrial gold-mining {{started in}} 1958 {{leading to the}} {{development}} of mining settlements, industrial enterprises, <b>power</b> plants, <b>hydro-electric</b> dams, <b>power</b> transmission lines and improved roads. By the 1960s, the region's population exceeded 100,000.|$|R

25|$|Mineral {{exploitation}} accelerated in {{the late}} 19th century, leading {{to the rise of}} important mining centres in the northeast, such as Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. The province harnessed its water power to generate <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> and created the state-controlled <b>Hydro-Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Commission of Ontario, later Ontario Hydro. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904. General Motors Canada was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Santee Cooper, {{also known}} officially from the 1930s as the South Carolina Public Service Authority, is South Carolina's {{state-owned}} electric and water utility {{that came into}} being during the New Deal as both a rural electrification and public works project that created two lakes and cleared large tracts of land while building <b>hydro-electric</b> dams and <b>power</b> plants. Its headquarters are located in Moncks Corner, South Carolina.|$|R
50|$|Bridal Veil Falls tend {{to freeze}} during cold winters {{and creates a}} wall of {{unstable}} ice. Because of this, {{the base of the}} falls becomes an extremely hazardous area and the park remains closed during the winter season. Bridal Veil Falls was named in the 19th century by the village of Popkum. In the early 20th century, the village utilized the waterfall with a <b>hydro-electric</b> generator to <b>power</b> the chalet and heated swimming pool in the village. Only the concrete foundation of the generator can be found today.|$|R
25|$|Peak demand {{refers to}} fluctuating, or varying, needs for {{electricity}} {{above and beyond}} base load levels. Added to this base load, the peak load raises Ontario's maximum electricity demand to 27,000 MW. This peak is typically met by oil/natural gas-fired, coal and select <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> plants. These plants can respond to changes in demand rapidly, but have higher operating costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{state has}} an {{abundance}} of resources and is rich in forests, rivers and lakes. Its <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> production {{is yet to be}} fully utilized. One of the oldest Shanan power station at Joginder Nagar Valley, commissioned in 1928, helped in building the Bhakra Dam Project. Himachal forests are known for coniferous trees. Herbs and medicinal plants amply contribute to many local and national pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|The CANDU, for Canada Deuterium Uranium, is a Canadian {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactor design {{used to generate}} electric power. The acronym refers to its deuterium oxide (heavy water) moderator and its use of (originally, natural) uranium fuel. CANDU reactors were first developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership between Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), the <b>Hydro-Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Commission of Ontario, Canadian General Electric, and other companies.|$|E
50|$|The Gurgel Itaipu E150 is an {{electric}} car, produced by Gurgel. The Itaipu {{was presented at}} the Salão do Automóvel in 1974, with an intended production start in December 1975. Only a few of these cars were produced, as it was of poor quality and drivability. Top speed was a mere 50 km/h. While about twenty pre-series cars were built, it never truly passed the prototype stage to hit the showroom floor. Nonetheless, it was the first electric car built in Latin America. The car was named after the huge <b>hydro-electric</b> dam and <b>power</b> plant on the border of Brazil and Paraguay.|$|R
50|$|Industrial gold-mining {{started in}} 1958 {{leading to the}} {{development}} of mining settlements, industrial enterprises, <b>power</b> plants, <b>hydro-electric</b> dams, <b>power</b> transmission lines and improved roads. By the 1960s, the region's population exceeded 100,000.With the dissolution of Dalstroy, the Soviets adopted new labor policies. While the prison labor was still important, it mainly consisted of common criminals. New manpower was recruited from all Soviet nationalities on a voluntary basis, {{to make up for the}} sudden lack of political prisoners. Young men and women were lured to the frontier land of Kolyma with the promise of high earnings and better living. But many decided to leave.The region's prosperity suffered under Soviet liberal policies in the end of the 1980s and 1990s with a considerable reduction in population, apparently by 40% in Magadan. A U.S. report from the late 1990s gives details of the region's economic shortfall citing outdated equipment, bankruptcies of local companies and lack of central support. It does however report substantial investments from the United States and the governor's optimism for future prosperity based on revival of the mining industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Tenix Group were in 1956 when Transfield was founded by two Italian - born {{mechanical}} engineers, Carlo Salteri and Franco Belgiorno-Nettis. Together they built one of Australia's most successful companies focused on major engineering projects, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, <b>hydro-electric</b> and coal <b>power</b> stations, oil rigs, concert halls, sugar mills and power lines. Included in their list of major achievements are {{the construction of the}} Gateway Bridge in Brisbane and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. By the early 1980s, Transfield had in excess of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of A$350 million.When visiting Australia in 1986 Pope John Paul II toured the Transfield factory located at Seven Hills.|$|R
25|$|Upriver {{from the}} city key {{industries}} were established including the Pasminco Electrolytic Zinc Company, Cadbury's Chocolate Factory (1920) and the Boyer Newsprint Mills, and since the early 20th century the cheap ready supply of <b>Hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> has meant Hobart {{has been able to}} maintain a small industrial base. It has never attracted the heavy industry so desired by the state's politicians, which meant that Hobart has remained the least industrialised of all of the Australian capital cities.|$|E
25|$|Current annual {{electricity}} demand in Ontario is 151 TWh. In other words, on average, Ontarians consume 12,750kWh {{per person per}} year. Based on 2003 information, this figure is approximately 25% lower than the Canadian average, roughly equal to U.S. rates, and about {{twice as high as}} European consumption levels (see: electricity consumption by country). In order to supply such demand, Ontario counts on 31,000 MW of installed power capacity, broken down as follows: 37% nuclear, 26% renewable (including <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power),</b> 16% natural gas and 21% coal.|$|E

Over the next two years the Oliver Chilled Plow Works would construct a <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>power</b> plant on the waterway to supply electricity for light, heat, and power to the Oliver Opera House, Oliver Hotel, South Bend factories, and other Oliver buildings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{shape of}} a <b>hydro-electric</b> (hydel) <b>power</b> station {{particularly}} the concrete around spiral case and generator foundation is so complex that the determination of actual stresses is very complicated and time-consuming process since it is essentially a three-dimensional problem. The stress variations in the structure have been studied using three-dimensional photoelastic method in few small scale models only. In the present study, finite element and boundary element analyses of spiral (scroll) case and generator foundation of a large hydel power station considering generator loads {{have been carried out}}. A simple and efficient method of slices for the geometric representation of the structure has been developed. Linear elastic analyses have been carried out using well established existing finite element and boundary element computer programs and two pre-processing computer programs have also been developed to support the 3 -D finite element program. Almost all of the present analyses show the same pattern of stresses and only their values differ, while most of the existing photoelastic study results indicate stresses with different pattern. In conclusion, a suitable, efficient and appropriate numerical method for the approximate analysis of the structure has been proposed...|$|R
