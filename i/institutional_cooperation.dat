40|$|Abstract: Bibliometric {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} {{to the field of}} industrial health in the past two decades. Since then, several studies have assessed progression of science in this area using quantitative measures and qualitative measures such as impact factor or H-indices. Since novel procedures such as density-equalizing mapping have not been used so far, the present study combined classical bibliometric tools with novel scientometric and visualizing techniques. All “INDUSTRIAL HEALTH ” entries listed in the ISI database since 1987 were screened and analyzed. Using bibliometric approaches, a continuous increase in qualitative markers such as collaboration numbers or citations were found while quantity markers such as author numbers or publication numbers remained relatively constant. The combination with density equalizing mapping revealed a distinct global pattern of research productivity and citation activity with Japanese institutions at the leading position. Radar chart techniques were used to visualize bi- and multilateral research <b>cooperations</b> and <b>institutional</b> <b>cooperations.</b> In summary, the present study supplies a first scientometric-bibliometric approach that visualizes research activity in “INDUS-TRIAL HEALTH ” over the past decades...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the role of}} the third sector and social economy in the emergence of cross-border network governance in the Basque border region. Cross-border relations have historically been initiated by movements within civil society, anticipating policy actors in this matter. A policy change occurred in the 1990 s, with the gradual Europeanization of a new policy framework which enabled <b>institutional</b> cross-border <b>cooperation.</b> The current engagement of social economy actors in this kind of cooperation is marked by this double heritage, with contrasting forms of implementations. Initiatives motivated by Basque identity, despite being constructed historically as alternatives, are today spearheading cross-border network governance. In contrast, institutional asymmetries might hinder the emergence of cross-border network governance within sectors (here: social integration through economic activity) with no particular reference to a shared identity...|$|R

40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{some aspects}} of the work in the archives in Vilnius. The author emphasizes that the Vilnius archives contain a lot of valuable literary documents and materials relating to the Polish literature, especially of the period 1830 – 1870, which is less known. Meanwhile, it is difficult to conduct a query. First, {{there are only a few}} catalogs of Vilnius collections that do not contain all the units included in the archival fonds. Second difficulty is the language, because the descriptions in the catalogs are usually in Lithuanian or Russian, even though they concern Polish-works. Thirdly, only a small percentage of the Polish part of the collections is digitized, so ephemeral sets quickly deteriorate. If we want to preservethe legacy of the borderland, we must find a way to support the queries in Vilnius, based on scientific and <b>institutional</b> Polish-Lithuanian <b>cooperation.</b> Publikacja dofinansowana przez Wydział Filologiczny Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego...|$|R

40|$|Started in 1997, the VLIR-UOS {{programme}} for <b>Institutional</b> University <b>Cooperation</b> (IUC) is an interuniversity cooperation programme of the Flemish universities.

In 2007 VLIR-UOS launched an open call inviting the Flemish universities to submit pro-posals for new IUC partnerships. This resulted in the pre-selection of the University of Limpopo [South Africa] and the Universidad Nacional Agraria la Molina (Peru).
