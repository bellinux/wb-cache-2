These competencies should be performed {{under the guidance of}} a Hazardous Materials Technician (HMT), allied professional, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). A more detailed description of specific tasks can be found in NFPA 472, Chapter 6.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were given}} single {{injections}} of vehicle {{or one of}} three doses of (+) -amphetamine (AM), 4 -methoxyamphetamine (MA) or 4 -ethoxyamphetamine (EA) after pretreatment with vehicle or reserpine, and vehicle or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT). EA is a "designer" drug that was recently seized from an <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Canada. Locomotion of the rats was recorded after treatment with the drugs, and whole brain levels of the drugs as well as monoamine neurotransmitters and their major acidic metabolites were then determined. Neither of the ring-substituted AM analogues influenced locomotion. AM induced locomotion in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by AMPT but potentiated by reserpine. Brain concentrations of EA were {{lower than those of}} the other two drugs. The brain levels of monoamines and their metabolites indicate that AM releases a newly synthesized pool of dopamine which is transferred to vesicles after re-uptake. A very low dose of AM, but not higher doses, was found to elevate serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine: 5 -HT) levels independently of effects on catecholamines. Both MA and EA affected monoamine metabolites {{in a manner consistent with}} actions as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-an effect which has been previously demonstrated to be true for MA. Both drugs increased 5 -HT levels at a very low dose, as did AM, but also increased noradrenaline levels at this dose. It is concluded that EA is not a psychomotor stimulant, but is similar in many of its effects to MA, a potent hallucinogen...|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{unconfirmed}} reports of lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide being synthesized in <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratories</b> and distributed on blotter paper or in liquid solution under names such as [...] "diazedine" [...] and [...] "λ".|$|R
50|$|A 1999 UNODC report {{notes that}} Schedule I is a {{completely}} different regime from the other three. According to that report, Schedule I mostly contains hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD that are produced by <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratories,</b> while the other three Schedules are mainly for licitly produced pharmaceuticals. The UNODC report also claims that the Convention's Schedule I controls are stricter than those provided for under the Single Convention, a contention {{that seems to be}} contradicted by the 2002 Senate of Canada and 2003 European Parliament reports.|$|R
2500|$|GHB can {{be easily}} {{manufactured}} with very little knowledge of chemistry, as it only involves the mixing of its two precursors, GBL and an alkali hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, to form the resulting GHB salt. Due to the ease of manufacture {{and the availability of}} its precursors, it is not mainly produced in <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratories</b> like most other synthetic drugs, but in private homes by low level producers instead. While available as a prescription for rare and severe forms of sleep disorders such as narcolepsy in some other countries, notably most of Europe, GHB was banned in the U.S. by the FDA in 1990. However, on 17 July 2002, GHB was approved for treatment of cataplexy, often associated with narcolepsy. GHB is [...] "colourless and odorless".|$|R
40|$|Methamphetamine, {{a central}} nervous system stimulant, is {{manufactured}} in <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratories</b> using over-the-counter ingredients (1). Many of these ingredients are haz ardous substances * that when released from active or abandoned methamphetamine laboratories can place first responders † at risk for serious injuries and death. In 16 states§, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry maintains the Hazardous Sub stances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system to collect and analyze data about the morbidity and mortality associated with hazardous substance-release events¶.

50|$|Dimethylamphetamine has {{occasionally}} {{been found}} in <b>illicit</b> methamphetamine <b>laboratories,</b> but is usually an impurity rather than the desired product. It may be produced by accident when methamphetamine is synthesised by methylation of amphetamine if the reaction temperature is too high or an excess of methylating agent is used.|$|R
50|$|Illicit methamphetamine is more {{commonly}} {{made by the}} reduction of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, which produces the more active d-methamphetamine isomer. The maximum conversion rate for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is 92%, although typically, <b>illicit</b> methamphetamine <b>laboratories</b> convert {{at a rate of}} 50% to 75%. Most methods of illicit production involve protonation of the hydroxyl group on the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine molecule.|$|R
40|$|Impurity {{profiling}} of seized methamphetamine {{can provide}} very useful information in criminal investigations and, specifically, on drug trafficking routes, sources of supply, and relationships between seizures. Particularly {{important is the}} identification of 'route specific' impurities or those which indicate the synthetic method used for manufacture in <b>illicit</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Previous researchers 1 - 2 have suggested impurities which are characteristic of the Leuckart and reductive amination (Al/Hg) methods of preparation. However, to date and importantly, these two synthetic methods have not been compared in a single study utilizing methamphetamine hydrochloride synthesised in-house and, therefore, of known synthetic origin. Using the same starting material, 1 -phenyl- 2 -propanone (P 2 P), 40 batches of methamphetamine hydrochloride were synthesised by the Leuckart and reductive amination methods (20 batches per method). Both basic and acidic impurities were extracted separately and analysed by GC-MS. From this controlled study, two route specific impurities for the Leuckart method and one route specific impurity for the reductive amination method are reported. The intra- and inter-batch variation of these route specific impurities was assessed. Also, the variation of the 'target impurities' recently recommended for methamphetamine profiling is discussed {{in relation to their}} variation within and between production batches synthesized using the Leuckart and reductive amination routes...|$|R
40|$|Very few <b>illicit</b> MDMA <b>laboratories</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} in Australia; only two MDMA laboratories were detected in Australia during 2000 – 01. Analysis of seized tablets nationally confirms that locally produced tablets containing methylamphetamine and/or {{a variety of other}} drugs continue to be marketed and sold as MDMA. While MDMA continues to be sourced primarily from European countries, a number of importations during 2000 – 01 originated in China. Southeast Asian ports were increasingly used as transhipment points for importations into Australia of European-produced MDMA. There was {{a significant increase in the}} weight of MDMA importations detected by Customs: 338. 4 kilograms during 2000 – 01 compared with 141. 6 kilograms in 1999 – 2000...|$|R
40|$|A 45 -year-old {{previously}} healthy caucasian man {{was admitted}} for pruritus, scleral icterus and dark urine. The patient {{was reported to}} have taken a spoon of a preparation containing camu-camu (myrciaria dubia) a day. He took no other drugs and did not drink alcohol or use <b>illicit</b> substance. <b>Laboratory</b> studies reveiled an elevated aspartate transaminase of 403 U/L, and alanine transaminase of 1185 U/L, alkalinephosphatase of 335 U/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase of 300 U/L, and elevated total bilirubin of 142 μmol/L. His complete blood count was normal. Tests for viral, metabolic or autoimmune causes of liver injury were negative. Liver biopsy demonstrated centrilobular hepatocellular damage was compatible with drug toxicity which was not of very recent origin. Clinical and laboratory signs of liver injury gradually improved and the patient was discharged. Myrciaria dubia is used as a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties. To our knowledge, this is the first report of liver injury probably related to use of camu-camu. Exclusion of other causes and the histological diagnosis were compatible with drug toxicity render camu-camu which was most likely as the cause of acute heaptitis most likely. It is important to increase the awareness of both clinicians and patients about the potential dangers of herbal remedies in absence of reliable studies of clinical efficacy and benefit-risk assessment. </span...|$|R
40|$|Methamphetamine {{contamination}} has {{the potential}} to be present in residential and commercial buildings as a result of illicit manufacture and drug use, in particular smoking. The illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and the smoking of methamphetamine results in the generation and deposition of drug aerosols/residues on all surfaces, porous and non-porous. These drug residues can remain in the home for a long period of time and if they are not properly identified and cleaned this can result in unwitting exposures and adverse health effects by individuals and families who subsequently rent or purchase these properties. Research has been undertaken to better understand what levels of methamphetamine contamination remains in homes following manufacture or smoking, and what factors related to the manufacture and building design affect the spread of contamination throughout the property. Data on contamination levels, and property observations, has been obtained from 100 homes and apartments throughout Australia to assist in better understanding the level of methamphetamine contamination that may be present. This data has been reviewed to develop a risk matrix that can be used at the start of an investigation or property assessment to determine the level of risk a property may pose to the public. The level of risk then determines the level of further investigation and remediation work that may be required to ensure the property is safe for future occupants. The risk matrix can be used by property managers including managers of public housing authorities where a significant number of <b>illicit</b> drug <b>laboratories</b> are located. Originality – This study provides data on the level and spread of methamphetamine contamination in former clandestine drug laboratories in Australia...|$|R
5000|$|In February of 1972, French traffickers {{offered a}} United States Army {{sergeant}} $96,000 (...) to smuggle 240 pounds (109 kg) of heroin into the United States. He informed his superior {{who in turn}} notified the BNDD. As {{a result of this}} investigation, five men in New York and two in Paris were arrested with 264 pounds (120 kg) of heroin, which had a street value of $50 million. In a 14-month period, starting in February 1972, six major <b>illicit</b> heroin <b>laboratories</b> were seized and dismantled in the suburbs of Marseille by French national narcotics police in collaboration with U.S. drug agents. On February 29, 1972, French authorities seized the shrimp boat, Caprice des Temps, as it put to sea near Marseille heading towards Miami. It was carrying 915 pounds (415 kg) of heroin. Drug arrests in France skyrocketed from 57 in 1970 to 3,016 in 1972. Also broken up as part of this investigation was the crew of Vincent Papa, whose members included Anthony Loria Sr. and Virgil Alessi. The well-organized gang was responsible for distributing close to a million dollars worth of heroin up and down the East Coast of the United States during the early 1970s, which in turn led to a major New York Police Department (NYPD) corruption scheme. The scope and depth of this scheme are still not known, but officials suspect it involved corrupt NYPD officers who allowed Papa, Alessi, and Loria access to the NYPD property/evidence storage room, where hundreds of kilograms of heroin lay seized from the now-infamous French Connection bust, and from which the men would help themselves and replace missing heroin with flour and cornstarch to avoid detection.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection {{is a primary}} cause of acquired heart disease, particularly of accelerated atherosclerosis, symptomatic heart failure, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Cardiac complications often occur in late-stage HIV infections as prolonged viral infection is becoming more relevant as longevity improves. Thus, multi-agent HIV therapies that help sustain life may also {{increase the risk of}} cardiovascular events and accelerated atherosclerosis. Discussion: Before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the two-to-five-year incidence of symptomatic heart failure ranged from 4 to 28 % in HIV patients. Patients both before and after HAART also frequently have asymptomatic abnormalities in cardiovascular structure. Echocardiographic measurements indicate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in 18 %, LV hypertrophy in 6. 5 %, and left atrial dilation in 40 % of patients followed on HAART therapy. Diastolic dysfunction is also common in long-term survivors of HIV infection. Accelerated atherosclerosis has been found in HIV-infected young adults and children without traditional coronary risk factors. Infective endocarditis, although rare in children, has high mortality in late-stage AIDS patients with poor nutritional status and severely compromised immune systems. Although lymphomas have been found in HIV-infected children, the incidence is low and cardiac malignancy is rare. Rates of congenital cardiovascular malformations range from 5. 6 to 8. 9 % in cohorts of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children with HIV-infected mothers. In non-HIV-infected infants born to HIV-infected mothers, foetal exposure to ART is associated with reduced LV dimension, LV mass, and septal wall thickness and with higher LV fractional shortening and contractility during {{the first two years of}} life. Conclusions: Routine, systematic, and comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including a thorough history and directed laboratory assays, is essential for the care of HIV-infected adults and children as cardiovascular illness has become a part of care for long-term survivors of HIV infection. The history should include traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, prior opportunistic infections, environmental exposures, and therapeutic and <b>illicit</b> drug use. <b>Laboratory</b> tests should include a lipid profile, fasting glucose, and HIV viral load. Asymptomatic cardiac disease related to HIV can be fatal, and secondary effects of HIV infection often disguise cardiac symptoms, so systematic echocardiographic monitoring is warranted...|$|R
