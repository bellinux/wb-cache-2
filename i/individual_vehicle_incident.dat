50|$|On 29 May 1999, about 4:50 a.m., an {{accident}} in the tunnel led to a fire in which twelve {{people were killed and}} 42 injured. Caused by a collision of up to 60 <b>individual</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the <b>incident</b> occurred when a truck collided with a column of stationary vehicles waiting at a traffic signal. As far as investigators could determine, eight people were killed by the force of the collision of the truck while four further victims died from the fire which followed, exacerbated by escaping fuel and hazardous materials on one of the vehicles involved. All of the victims were burned to the point of leaving skeletal remains at most, and for those in more intense areas of the fire, nothing more than ashes.|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{of fatal}} polytrauma in {{children}} in Barnaul {{over the period}} of 11 years, study of medical records of polytrauma patients brought in to hospital and medicolegal autopsy data from the cases of fatal polytrauma in children. 685 cases of child polytrauma were registered from the year 2001 to 2011 including 88 cases of fatal polytrauma. 68 children died before admission, 20 patients hospitalized resulted in death. Most fatal cases resulted from motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> (61 / 69, 3 %), falling from a height (20 / 22, 7 %), criminal injuries (3 / 3, 4 %), home accidents (2 / 2, 3 %), and street injuries (2 / 2, 3 %). The highest lethality rate related to cases of falling from a height (18, 2 %), motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> (13, 6 %), criminal and street injuries (10 %). The lethality rate of child polytrauma in urban area amounted to 12, 8 %, death rate - 7, 1 per 100 000 population per year. The highest lethality rate was noted among infants (27, 7 %) and adolescents (16, 7 %). Most fatal cases resulted from motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> (61 / 69, 3 %). The highest increase of mortality rate in polytrauma is observed during summer season. Major causes of death are shock and substantial blood loss...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of primary health care reforms, the {{profession}} of social work has been afforded the opportunity to engage with individuals and families in various primary health care settings, including local hospitals. Social work professionals perform a range of distinct and important roles when working in hospitals. This is particularly evident when engaging in social work practice {{in the emergency room}} and intensive care unit. Crisis intervention represents merely one role that social workers must undertake in the emergency room and intensive care unit. However, this role is of importance, especially when working with individuals involved in personal injury motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents.</b> This practicum report will briefly discuss the impact of primary health care reforms on the profession of social work and the roles that social workers engage in when working in primary health care settings. There will also be a brief discussion focusing on crisis intervention and personal injury motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents.</b> This report will also briefly examine the practical experience of a Master of Social Work student working in a primary health care setting and the research completed focusing on personal injury motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> and the development of adverse stress reactions.

40|$|Typical freeway {{inductance}} loop detection systems, {{under normal}} operation, aggregate individual loop detector actuations sampled at 60 Hz into 20 second or 30 second average velocity, flow, and lane occupancy measurements. While such aggregations {{are appropriate for}} serving as inputs to control system algorithms, and save disk space for archiving loop data, much useful data regarding <b>individual</b> <b>vehicles</b> are lost. For single loop detectors, the lost information includes <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> arrival, departure and presence times. For speed traps, the lost information also includes the calculated <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed and length.

Furthermore, the unavailability of this information makes in-depth investigation of detector errors difficult or even impossible.

40|$|Abstract: Road traffic {{management}} {{has traditionally been}} targeted through control and monitoring {{of the flow of}} vehicles, using the same measures towards all vehicles. As vehicles can have very different capabilities and profiles, it is however desired to use different control strategies towards the <b>individual</b> <b>vehicles</b> to meet the environ-mental, safety and efficiency targets for the future. SMARTFREIGHT has developed a holistic control and monitoring tool for managing the traffic, and <b>individual</b> <b>vehicles</b> in particular. The <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> is integrated with the {{traffic management}} and freight distribution management centers by using open service interfaces for an interoperable information exchange between distributed systems across a heterogeneous wireless infrastructure. SMARTFREIGHT realized and successfully demonstrated this inte-gration in its final event in Trondheim. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} work-related fatalities that occurred between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011 and were notifiable to jurisdictions under their work health and safety legislation. In 2010 – 11, Australian work health and safety jurisdictions reported a total of 138 notifiable work-related fatalities to Safe Work Australia. Of these fatalities, 120 were workers and 18 were bystanders (people who suffered a fatal injury {{as a consequence of}} someone else’s work activity). In comparison, there were fewer work-related fatalities notified in the previous financial year, 2009 – 10 : in total, 124, comprising 111 worker fatalities and 13 bystander fatalities. Most of the work-related fatalities that occurred in 2010 – 11 were of men: 14 fatalities were of women, and of those, 8 were bystanders. Because work-related fatalities were predominantly of men (a pattern consistently seen in all years of the data series), tables and graphs in this publication are not disaggregated on the basis of sex. Most <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> on public roads are investigated by the police, so those that are work-related may not be reported to work health and safety authorities. Because of this known limitation, notifications where the fatality was categorised as falling under the mechanism <b>Vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> are identified as occurring on public roads or elsewhere. The reader should note that of the 23 fatalities resulting from <b>Vehicle</b> <b>incidents,</b> 10 occurred on public roads (see Table 1).

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{microscopic}} approach describes {{the motion of}} each <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle.</b> It models actions like the accelerations, decelerations and lane changes of each driver {{as a response to}} the surrounding traffic. It is known that the macroscopic approach can be used to describe both <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> motion and general traffic flow status [18]. Hence, we use the macroscopic traffic flow model to describe the vehicular traffic flow and utilize the average velocity quantity to consider the mathematical distribution of vehicular movements over the traffic network. Moreover, the connection availability is determined based on the position, direction and velocity of each <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> so the involvement of microscopic traffic flow model can improve the accuracy of the modelling. Thus, we propose a hybrid approach combining both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models as an improvement to [19], where we used only the macroscopic traffic flow model. The vehicular velocity distribution comes from the macroscopic approach, and each <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle's</b> movement is tuned using a microscopic approach to refine the prediction of its movement. Using this hybrid approach, we can obtain more accurate estimation of the link reliability between vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The V 85 speed {{reflects}} the 85 th percentile speed of vehicles in a traffic stream passing a given element {{on the highway}} section. The large amount of speed differential in V 85 between the two successive elements along a highway reflects lack of speed consistency in the highway section. This lack of speed consistency can result in increased crash risk. Recent research points to several {{problems associated with the}} conventional method of measuring [Delta]V 85 between successive highway elements: (1) failure to reflect <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed profiles; and (2) failure to account for inter-dependence in <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> speeds between successive elements. These problems have serious implications for justifying safety treatment when conventional [Delta]V 85 measure is applied. A number of researchers have suggested that the estimated speed differential based on <b>individual</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed profiles in successive elements is significantly higher than that obtained using the conventional approach. In this paper, we assess the safety implications of using the conventional [Delta]V 85 and introduce a hierarchical model for considering <b>individual</b> <b>vehicles</b> speed consistency. These findings lead to important implications for introducing engineering treatments to improve safety along in two-lane rural highways based on the criteria of speed consistency. ...|$|R
