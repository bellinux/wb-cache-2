40|$|Abstract Background Coping {{with the}} {{stresses}} of chronic disease is considered as {{a key factor in}} the perceived impairment of health related quality of life (HRQL). Little is known though about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic and disease-related variables. Methods The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients, attending a university nephrology department. Seventy-nine (79) pre-dialysis patients of disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients were included. HRQL was assessed by the 36 -item Short-Form health survey (SF- 36), <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI) and psychological distress by the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL- 90 -R). Regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between SF- 36 dimensions and <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> style. Results Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF- 36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF- 36 (worse mental health). In contrast, a higher defensive score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF- 36 (better health), but this was marginally significant. Conclusions The results provided evidence that emotional defensiveness as a coping style tends to differentially affect the mental and the physical component of HRQL in CKD. Clinicians {{should be aware of the}} effects of long-term denial and could examine the possibility of screening for <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> and depression in recently diagnosed CKD patients with the aim to improve both physical and mental health. </p...|$|E

Also to have chosen this for your career might mean to have some particularities in these areas. The evaluation of coping and defense style mechanisms for residents in psychiatry that conduct clinical work. A descriptive study was developed to determine and evaluate <b>defensive</b> and <b>coping</b> styles for residents in psychiatry. DSQ- 60 and COPE scales were applied on a 31 willing resident in psychiatry from approximate 50 residents in total from the center in which the study was conducted. The most frequent mechanisms found on the evaluated group are: “Altruism”,”Self-observation” – superior defense styles and “Positive interpretation and growth” - an emotion focused coping style and „Planning” – a problem focused coping style. The chosen profession can be a factor that underlines some inborn abilities but also a modulating factor for one's structure. The developing of adequate coping and defense styles might be a requirement for becoming a psychiatrist {{or it might be}} a gain for someone working in this field day by day...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{defensive}} active {{coping response}} is a recognised cardiovascular risk factor in Africans, especially in men. It is uncertain whether autonomic dysfunction {{might be the}} underlying cause. We therefore investigated associations between salivary MHPG (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenolglycol), as a marker of sympathetic activity, and subclinical vascular disease risk in <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> Africans and Caucasians. Methods The Coping Strategy Indicator questionnaire identified participants who preferably utilise <b>defensive</b> <b>coping.</b> Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored for 24 h and carotid intima–media thickness (CIMT) was determined from ultrasound images, {{as an indicator of}} subclinical vascular disease risk. Salivary MHPG was analysed with high performance liquid chromatography. Results Defensive active coping Africans (n = 143) showed overall poorer health than Caucasians (n = 148), with higher self-reported stress, alcohol abuse, hypertension, abdominal obesity, and risk of diabetes (p ≤ 0. 05). African women demonstrated lower levels of MHPG compared with Caucasian women, although no differences in men were found. Furthermore, Africans revealed a trend of increased low grade inflammation and glycated haemoglobin which was associated with increased CIMT. There was an inverse association between MHPG and CIMT [β = − 0. 22 (− 0. 40, − 0. 03) ], in African men with a high risk of subclinical vascular disease (n = 30). Conclusions Novel findings revealed that defensive active coping Africans are more at risk of subclinical vascular disease, possibly resultant of autonomic exhaustion (decreased MHPG). When <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> fails, sympathetic hyperactivity may be followed by autonomic exhaustion and sympatho-adrenal-medullary system desensitisation, resulting in pathology.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} ways {{of coping}} {{in people with}} mild to moderate AD when faced with situations that are challenging to their memory. METHOD: Twenty-four participants (12 with mild and 12 with moderate AD) were presented {{with a set of}} seven tasks that were analogues of everyday situations that tax memory. The participants' responses were videotaped and analysed. RESULTS: Participants' coping responses were grouped into seven categories to best reflect the main strategies. Individuals used a significantly greater frequency of effortful problem solving (self-reliance and reliance on carers) (p < 0. 01) than other ways of coping. Positive acknowledgement of memory difficulties was used significantly more than negative acknowledgement and <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> (concealment and avoidance) (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: This study used novel methodology of observation of behavioural responses in analogues of everyday situations. The predominance of effortful problem-solving emphasizes the role of the person with AD as an active agent in the management of memory loss. An emphasis in previous literature on <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> and denial is counter-balanced by the finding that participants commonly coped by acknowledging their memory impairment...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has depicted relative arousal of {{the left and right}} cerebral hemispheres as related to utilization of particular <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> styles, level of anxiety, and perceptual styles. The right and left hemispheres are also presented in the literature as differing in visual-spatial and verbal-auditory short term memory abilities. The present research studied 127 right handed undergraduates' relative performance on forward spatial and digits memory spans in relation to hemispheric lateralization and other perceptual and personality variables hypothesized in the literature to be related to hemispheric arousal. It was hypothesized that the forward spatial and digit memory spans would display asymmetrical sensitivity to hemispheric arousal. That is, in a series of successive factor analyses, a hemispheric balance factor, a trait anxiety factor, and a short term memory factor would emerge. The three factors were hypothesized to be unrelated to each other. During an initial group pretesting, subjects were given pencil and paper measures of handedness, trait anxiety, and several <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> styles. During a second individual testing, subjects were administered measures of short term memory, field independence, and a computerized presentation of geometric designs which measured the subjects ability to detect differences which occurred at either the global or analytic level (Navon task). The factor analyses revealed only the hypothesized trait anxiety factor. The hypothesized short term memory and hemispheric balance of arousal factors did not emerge. Instead, a. <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> style factor and separate verbal—auditory and visual-spatial short term memory factors emerged. Several methodological difficulties of the present study which possibly contributed to the failure of the two hypothesized factors to emerge were discussed. Several additional findings, including sex differences in hemispheric lateralization, were presented. Also, signal detection analysis revealed a pattern such that trait anxious subjects were biased toward over-reporting differences on the Navon task.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of vandalism and vandal behavior of adolescents. Vandal behavior consists of intentional or unintentional actions for the damage, destruction, and unauthorized transformation of material objects of a strange or public property. Despite the obvious damage done to the environment by vandals, this form of deviant behavior of adolescents is examined exclusively {{in terms of the}} statement of fact, description of forms of consequences, and determination of effective measures to combat them. To the authors' best knowledge, no publications can be found available in the literature that describe predictors of vandal activity of the person, consider the mechanisms of the emergence of this strategy of human interaction with environmental objects, and analyze the genesis of this deviation. Of course, these circumstances reduce the potential effectiveness of the developed programs and methods for prevention and counteraction to vandal behavior. Understanding vandalism as a form of <b>defensive</b> and <b>coping</b> behavior makes it possible (a) to reveal determination mechanisms of this deviation and (b) create a scientific basis for understanding the psychological nature of destructive human interaction with material objects, which can ensure the creation of effective ways to prevent it. To study correlations of the person's defense and coping system and the choice of the model of vandal behavior, the authors surveyed 60 adolescent respondents by applying a cross-sectional method using standardized questionnaires. The obtained data processing was carried out in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics 19. 0) by means of descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The discovered patterns of relationship (a) confirmed the assumption that vandalism is conditioned by <b>defensive</b> and <b>coping</b> mechanisms of personality, and (b) determined relations between certain types of a teenager's destructive activity and elements of psychological defenses and coping actvities...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} fear-provoking HIV prevention messages can lead to <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> strategies among sexually active students who encounter such messages. An information-processing model of defensive responses is proposed that identifies and operationally defines four mediating processes—attention avoidance, blunting, suppression, and counterargumentation—that may lead to the rejection or denial of threat-ening health messages. Attention avoidance occurs when people indiscriminately avoid all messages; blunting is the use of distraction to avoid only threatening information in the message. Suppression occurs when people try to stop thinking about the information and avoid forming inferences about its self-relevance; counterargumentation is the biased assessment that follows comprehension and arises along with self-relevant elaboration. Situational influences on people’s choice of <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> strategy are considered, and implica-tions for researchers and practitioners are discussed. One of the persistent problems in AIDS education and prevention is the tendency for people to believe that “it won’t happen to me. ” To change people’s views about their vul-nerability to HIV and AIDS, many educators have returned to the standard foundation of preventive medical education: fear.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Defensive</b> <b>coping</b> (AC) {{responses}} in urban African males {{have been associated}} with vascular responsiveness, partly explaining autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We therefore aimed to assess whether AC responses facilitate higher blood pressure and early sub-clinical structural vascular disease via alterations in frequency- and time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) responses. Methods:We included 355 African and Caucasian men and women without pre-existing atrial fibrillation, aged 45 9 years. Significant interaction on main effects (coping ethnicity gender) for left carotid intima media thickness far wall (L-CIMTf) and cross sectional wall area values necessitated selection of AC responders above mean via the Coping Strategy Indicator. We collected B-mode ultrasound L-CIMTf, ambulatory BP andeHRV data. Overnight fasting blood was obtained. Results: Overall, Africans and AC Africans, mostly men, revealed a poorer lifestyle profile, higher prevalence of hypertensive status, disturbed sympathovagal balance and depressed HRV temporal and geometric patterns compared to the Caucasians (P 0. 05). Moderately depressed non-linear and timedomain HRV (SDNN < 100 ms) was prevalent in 28 % of Africans compared to 11 % of Caucasians. A similar trend was shown for the AC African participants (32 %) compared to Caucasians (16 %). Only depressed HRV time-domain (SDNN: adj.

While perceived stigmatization theoretically and empirically has been accounted for {{as an independent}} and unalterable factor, this longitudinal study focuses on reciprocal effects between stigmatization and social ties. The duration of mental illness is included as a grouping variable to extend the longitudinal perspective. A sample of severely mentally ill persons (n= 165) in two psychiatric hospitals in Zurich {{took part in a}} structured interview during their admission and 1 year later. Cross-lagged path models were designed to test the interrelations of (1) perceived stigmatization, (2) a <b>defensive</b> stigma <b>coping</b> orientation, (3) concrete stigmatizing experiences, and either (4) social network, or (5) perceived social support as dependent variables. Contrary to previous findings, neither of the three components of stigmatization tested has any influence on social network or support.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that defensive pessimists use problem-focused coping in stressful situations. The process of coping with stress by defensive pessimists appears to be affected by the desire for control. Therefore, the effect of the desire for control on <b>defensive</b> pessimism, <b>coping</b> and stress response in controllable and uncontrollable situations was investigated. Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (n = 325) participated in the study. Participants reported past stressful events. And they were classified into eight subgroups: those with, or without the perceived controllability of the events, which cognitive strategy to use, and the degree of desire for control. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that high desire for control group tended to use problem-focused coping in controllable situation. In uncontrollable situations, defensive pessimists tended to feel stress responses, and especially in low desire for control group, defensive pessimists felt more anxiety than strategic optimists. Additionally, high desire for control group tended to feel anger in uncontrollable situations. These results imply that desire for control effects <b>coping</b> adaptively, and <b>defensive</b> pessimists with low desire for control might not use emotion-focused coping so they feel more anxiety in uncontrollable situations. Although defensive pessimists supposed to have vulnerability to feel stress response easily, they might maintain their health by keeping moderate level of desire for control.

40|$|Findings from a Sub-Saharan African Cohort An {{escalating}} {{prevalence of}} hypertension in black Africans, particularly in males, is causing concern, {{but the jury}} is still out on causative factors [1, 2]. One possible mechanism is sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyper-responsivity in urban Africans [1 - 3], which informed the design of the Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Africans (SABPA) prospective cohort study (2008 -). In our commentary we will highlight our initial findings on stress appraisal and risk markers for structural vascular disease. Stress Appraisal and Risk for Structural Vascular Disease Personality, environment, previous experiences, and perceptions influence our behavioral responses and a person's perception of the stressor as a challenge or threat [4]. Stress appraisal or coping responses include mainly defensive, social support, and emotional avoidance coping responses [5]. <b>Defensive</b> <b>coping</b> responses entails problem solving, being-in-control, acceptance of the stressor as a reality, and endeavoring to actively eliminate the stressor; "seeking social support " implies an active coping process for comfort and advice in stressful times. Emotional avoidance has been associated with denial, defeat, loss of control, and cardiometabolic pathology [5, 6]. Stress appraisal or copin...|$|E
40|$|Counselor {{educators}} commonly experience {{resistance from}} students when the classroom focus turns to issues, literature, projects, or discussions involving race. Recognizing this resistance {{as an obstacle}} to learning, scholars developed strategies to address it. These strategies, however, have been based largely on individualistic conceptions of student resistance that obscure its possible sociopolitical influences and overlook the potential for formulating strategies to address its sociopolitical underpinnings. To expand the view of student resistance as more than simply individual behavior and thereby assist in developing and improving tools to overcome it, this project interprets student resistance as a sociopolitical phenomenon by connecting it to a complex of general behaviors that reinforce the sociopolitical context of White racial hegemony. For this purpose, I define student resistance as an issue of emotion which I explicate with a cognitive appraisal emotional process model. To begin the project, I went into five regularly scheduled counselor education classrooms to screen a video presentation addressing two topics that frequently evoke resistance from students: White racial group advantage and oppression of racial minority groups. Thirty-seven masters level counseling students participated in the project by providing certain demographic information and describing their experiences of the video presentation on questionnaires and in classroom discussions. Applying my definition, I identified the following manifestations of resistance in the students’ descriptions of their experiences: harm-related appraisals, beliefs rationalizing the appraisals, negative emotions, and <b>defensive</b> <b>coping</b> actions. Analyzing these manifestations of student resistance in light of critical whiteness studies and social dominance theory, I found that beliefs underlying students’ harm-related appraisals and resulting coping actions connected most readily to behavior that reinforces White racial hegemony. The particular reinforcing beliefs students expressed gave credence to White superiority, nonwhite inferiority, and traditional American myths used to justify White racial dominance. <b>Defensive</b> <b>coping</b> actions consisted of: (1) avoiding race-related discussions; (2) attacking the person talking about racism and White privilege; (3) becoming resigned to racial injustice and doing nothing about it; and (4) escaping responsibility for racial injustice. A main conclusion of this project is that student resistance is problematic because it presents an obstacle to important learning, may function as a form of violence against students in the classroom who are members of subjugated groups, and represents behavior that precludes the development of therapeutic relationships with future clients. Strategies faculty can use to address student resistance that stem from findings in this project are discussed. They include: (1) provide theoretical frames of understanding; (2) identify sociopolitical influences on beliefs; (3) facilitate communication; (4) increase the desire for social justice; and (5) introduce the Hero’s Journey. Ideas for future research that further describe and explain student resistance are suggested. Counselor EducationDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Panic {{disorder}} {{patients are}} vulnerable to recurrent panic attacks. Two neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed to explain this susceptibility. The first assumes that panic patients have deficient serotonergic inhibition of neurons localized in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain that organize <b>defensive</b> reactions to <b>cope</b> with proximal threats and of sympathomotor control areas of the rostral ventrolateral medulla that generate most of the neurovegetative symptoms of the panic attack. The second suggests that endogenous opioids buffer normal subjects from the behavioral and physiological manifestations of the panic attack, and their deficit brings about heightened suffocation sensitivity and separation anxiety in panic patients, making them more vulnerable to panic attacks. Experimental results obtained in rats performing one-way escape in the elevated T-maze, an animal model of panic, indicate that the inhibitory action of serotonin on defense is connected with activation of endogenous opioids in the periaqueductal gray. This allows reconciliation of the serotonergic and opioidergic hypotheses of panic pathophysiology, the periaqueductal gray being the fulcrum of serotonin-opioid interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{halothane}} anaesthesia and neuroleptanalgesia (NLA) on the phagocytic {{activity of the}} reticulo-endothelial system (RES) was investigated {{with the aid of}} the Lipofundin clearance test. The results suggest that halothane in nitrous oxide depresses the phagocytic activity of the RES. NLA did not exert a depressant effect on the RES function. As it is essential for the body to be in a <b>defensive</b> condition to <b>cope</b> adequately with infection and cancer metastases, care must be taken to ensure that an anaesthetic procedure does not cause additional impairment of RES function. The results of the investigations suggest that NLA may have advantages in this respect. The observation that storage takes place in the reti-cular tissue and in endothelial cells in lymph nodes and bone marrow (Ufer cells, sinus cells), in the liver (Kupffer cells) and probably also in the adrenal cortex sooner than in any other tissue led Aschoff (1924) to speak of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) as acting in defence. The function of the RES is of decisive importanc...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dissociation between {{behavioural}} <b>defensive</b> active <b>coping</b> (AC) control albeit physiological “loss of control” responses {{was associated}} with silent ischaemia and structural wall abnormalities in African men. Whether it applies to structural alterations and endothelial dysfunction is uncertain. We therefore aimed to determine AC ethnic-gender specific receiver operating characteristic (ROC) carotid intima media far wall (CIMTf) cut points best associated with 24 -h BP, -silent ischaemia and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c). Methods: Participants included African and Caucasians (N= 317) without pre-existing stroke or atrial fibrillation, aged 45 ± 9 years. The Coping Strategy Indicator {{was used to measure}} AC. Ultrasound CIMTf, ambulatory BP, silent ischaemia and fasting blood samples were obtained. Results: Between 69 and 77 % of AC African men showed above normal diastolic BP and HbA 1 c levels compared to 44 – 48 % of AC Caucasian men. In AC African women, 41 – 60 % showed above normal BP, silent ischaemia and HbA 1 c levels compared to 17 – 44 % of their Caucasian counterparts. ROC curve analyses, detecting optimal CIMTf cut points, ranged between 0. 57 and 0. 65 mm (BP) and 0. 71 and 0. 74 mm (silent ischaemia) in AC ethnic-gender groups. Only HbA 1 C (> 5. 7 %), with a sensitivity/specificity 47 %/ 74 %, after controlling for confounders, predicted structural alterations at an optimal cut point of 0. 69 mm in AC African men (OR 4. 5; 95 % CI 2. 93 – 18. 73). Conclusion: Novel findings of behavioural resilience were apparent in the AC African female despite a high prevalence of risk markers. In AC males, chronic hyperglycaemia facilitated endothelial dysfunction, i. e. a physiological “loss of control” and susceptibility to stroke risk. [URL]...|$|R
