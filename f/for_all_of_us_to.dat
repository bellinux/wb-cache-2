500|$|In 2001, a {{memorial}} {{was created in}} Stockholm to honor Wallenberg. It was unveiled by King Carl XVI Gustaf, at a ceremony attended by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his wife Nane Maria Annan, Wallenberg's niece. At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> act when we can and to have the courage to help those who are suffering and in need of help". The memorial's design (see photo) has been considered inappropriate by some critics.|$|E
500|$|From 2005 to 2011, the Club {{was under}} the {{direction}} of Paul Rardin. Notable achievements during this time include international tours to Spain in 2008 and Cuba in 2011. The Cuban tour was considered especially significant, given that Americans have not easily been able to travel to the country legally, but the University gave financial assistance and an offer of a cultural exchange to make the tour happen. In 2010, the club celebrated its 150th anniversary, and as part of the celebrations performed a set of joint concerts with the Harvard University and University of Virginia Glee Clubs, taking a variety of music including contemporary American songs, folk and Renaissance music. Rardin said [...] "It's a wonderful opportunity <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see, hear and learn from three different ensembles." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Beyoncé said: [...] "We all see the {{headlines}} and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

500|$|Gore {{himself would}} later {{poke fun at}} the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, [...] "Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: [...] "Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!" [...] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award [...] "for three decades of {{contributions}} to the Internet" [...] at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): [...] "Please don't recount this vote." [...] He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: [...] "We all invented the Internet." [...] Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: [...] "It is time to reinvent the Internet <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make it more robust and much more accessible {{and use it to}} reinvigorate our democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|After collaborating on {{her great}} successes The Woman in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997), Twain and her then-husband Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange {{decided to take}} a musical hiatus. The two {{relocated}} to Switzerland, settled down, and had a child, Eja, in August 2001. Twain felt content and was in a very positive state of mind, which inspired Up! (2002). She and Lange conceptualized the album to be very positive, optimistic, and uplifting; they desired to evade dark subject matters, yet still be profound through optimism. In doing so, they co-wrote every track on Up!, in which few tracks were ballads, something Twain considered a small ratio compared to the nineteen songs on the album. She explained it was not done deliberately, but influenced by her and Lange's state of mind at the time, adding, [...] "There just didn't seem to be enough room for [...] ". One of the ballads was [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", which Twain deemed necessary to come down in tempo. She said the song was very powerful and, as with each track on Up!, was significant to her. Twain said of the track, [...] "This is the only heartbreak song on the new CD. [...] a chance <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> catch our breath here." [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" [...] was later selected as the eighth and final single from Up!, fifth to impact the North American music market. It was released to country radio on February 9, 2004 and to adult contemporary radio on March 22, 2004. A live CD single and digital download were taken from Up! Live in Chicago, and released on March 9, 2004 with the same cover as the video album. CD singles and 7" [...] singles were later issued by Mercury Nashville Records on March 30, 2004.|$|E

The Institute of Economic Affairs {{arranged}} a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after. During Thatcher's only visit to the Conservative Research Department {{in the summer of}} 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the [...] "middle way" [...] was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher [...] "reached into her briefcase and took out a book. It was Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. Interrupting our pragmatist, she held the book up <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see. 'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in {{his essay}} [...] "Why Read the Classics?" [...] that [...] "a classic is a book that has never {{finished}} saying what it has to say" [...] and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): [...] "Your classic author {{is the one you}} cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him." [...] Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says [...] "There is nothing for it but <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> invent our own ideal libraries of classics." ...|$|E

VanderSloot also contributed $2,700, the maximum allowed by law, to the GOP presidential campaign of former technology executive Carly Fiorina. In November 2015, VanderSloot announced that he supported Rubio for president and {{that he planned to}} host fundraisers and bundle contributions on Rubio's behalf. In June 2016, VanderSloot said that he was ready to support Donald Trump as the [...] "best bet" [...] to defeat Hillary Clinton, and in September of that year Donald Trump Jr. made a private visit to VanderSloot at Melaleuca headquarters. Following the presidential election in November 2016, VanderSloot announced on Twitter that Trump was not his first, second, or third choice as a candidate but that it was “time <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come together and unite behind our new president.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes wanted {{young black}} writers to be {{objective}} about their race, but not to scorn it or flee it. He understood the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed {{that some of the}} younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes's work Panther and the Lash, posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites. Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work. One of these young black writers (Loften Mitchell) observed of Hughes: [...] "Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Boondocks {{has been}} a {{frequent}} subject of controversy since its comic-strip debut in 1999, with ABC News noting, [...] "Fans and critics of The Boondocks loved and hated the strip for the same reasons: its cutting-edge humor and unapologetic, sometimes unpopular, views on various issues, including race, politics, {{the war on terrorism}} and the September 11 attacks." [...] Numerous outlets predicted the show would encounter controversy prior to its November 2005 debut, due to its casual use of the word [...] "nigger". According to an article in The Washington Post, references to Rosa Parks were removed from one of the series' first completed episodes within a week of her death. In 2006, the Reverend Al Sharpton protested the first-season episode [...] "Return of the King," [...] for Martin Luther King, Jr.'s character's use of the word [...] "nigga," [...] saying [...] "Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures." [...] Cartoon Network released a statement in response defending McGruder: [...] "We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> remember that and to continue to take action," [...] the statement said. The episode was later awarded a Peabody Award for being [...] "an especially daring episode".|$|E
