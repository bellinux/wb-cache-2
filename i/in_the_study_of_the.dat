This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings {{can be made from}} a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Many {{examples}} of rock art by the Muisca {{have been discovered}} on the Altiplano. The first rock art has been discovered by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. The rock art consists of petroglyphs (carvings) and petrographs (drawings). The petrographs were made using the index finger. Pioneer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock art has been Miguel Triana. Later contributions have been done by Diego Martínez, Eliécer Silva Celis and others. It is theorised that the rock art has been made {{under the influence of}} ayahuasca (yahé).|$|E

5|$|The domesticated cat and {{its closest}} wild {{ancestor}} are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. About 250 heritable genetic disorders {{have been identified}} in cats, many similar to human inborn errors. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human diseases.|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear {{candidate for}} a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx plays an important role, not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin of birds, but {{in the study of}} dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.|$|E
