6000|$|Kambajong, {{the chief}} Tibetan village near this, after Phari and Giantchi, is {{situated}} on the Arun (called in Tibet [...] "Chomachoo"), on the road from Sikkim to Jigatzi* [I have adopted the simplest mode of spelling this name that I could find, and omitted the zong or jong, which means fort, and generally terminates it. I think {{it would not be}} difficult to enumerate fully a dozen ways of spelling the word, of which Shigatzi, Digarchi, and Djigatzi are the most common. The Tibetans tell me that they cross two passes after leaving Donkia, or Kongra Lama, en route for Jigatzi, on both of which they suffer from headaches and difficulty of breathing; one is over the Kambajong range; the other, much loftier, is over that of Kiang-lah: as they do not complain of Bhomtso, which is also crossed, and is 18,500 feet, the others may be very lofty indeed. The distance from Donkia pass to Jigatzi is said to be ten days' journey for loaded yaks. Now, according to Turner's observations (evidently taken with great care) that capital is in latitude 29 degrees 4 minutes 20 seconds north, or only seventy miles north of Donkia; and as the yak travels at the rate of sixteen miles a day, the country must be extraordinarily rugged, or the valleys tortuous. Turner took eight or nine days on his journey from Phari to Teshoo Loombo, a distance of only eighty miles; yet he is quoted as an authority for the fact of Tibet being a plain! he certainly crossed an undulating country, probably 16,000 to 17,000 feet high; a continuation eastwards of the Cholamoo features, and part of the same mountain range that connects Chumulari and Donkia: he had always lofty mountains in eight, and rugged ones on either side, after he had entered the Painomchoo valley. It is a remarkable and significant fact that Turner never appears to have seen Chumulari after having passed it, nor Donkia, Kinchinjhow, or Kinchinjunga at any time.] and Teshoo Loombo. I did not see it, but a long, stony mountain range above the town is very conspicuous, its sides presenting an <b>interrupted</b> <b>line</b> of cliffs, resembling the port-holes of a ship: some fresh-fallen snow lay at the base, but none at the top, which was probably 18,500 feet high. The banks of the Arun are thence inhabited at intervals all the way to Tingre, where it enters Nepal.|$|E

50|$|Multiple devices sharing an <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> (of any {{triggering}} style) all act as spurious interrupt sources {{with respect}} to each other. With many devices on one line the workload in servicing interrupts grows {{in proportion to the}} square of the number of devices. It is therefore preferred to spread devices evenly across the available <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines.</b> Shortage of <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines</b> is a problem in older system designs where the <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines</b> are distinct physical conductors. Message-signalled interrupts, where the <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> is virtual, are favored in new system architectures (such as PCI Express) and relieve this problem to a considerable extent.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 49 mm. The forewings are dark greyish brown with interrupted basal and antemedial whitish lines.

The hindwings are semihyaline white with a fuscous-grey shade on the inner margin.|$|E
50|$|Adults are silvery white, the {{forewings}} with a brown stripe, which {{rests on}} the interior border and becomes slightly and abruptly broader at a little before half {{the length of the}} wing, and extends very nearly to the exterior border. A few slender brown streaks form an <b>interrupted</b> <b>line</b> between the stripe and the costa. The marginal points are black and minute. The hindwings of the males are cinereous while those of the females are brown.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm. The forewings are pale ochreous, thinly {{speckled with}} dark brown {{and with a}} rather broad ill-defined streak of dark brown suffusion beneath the middle {{from the base of}} the dorsum to the termen beneath the apex. There is a slender suffused dark brown streak along the costa from the middle to near the apex, as well as a dark fuscous terminal <b>interrupted</b> <b>line</b> or series of dots.

50|$|Arbitration {{enhancement}} ensures better system throughput, since {{control is}} passed more efficiently.

5000|$|PCI also {{suffered}} from the relative scarcity of unique <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines.</b> With only 4 <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines</b> (INTA/B/C/D), systems with many PCI devices require multiple functions to share an <b>interrupt</b> <b>line,</b> complicating host-side interrupt-handling. PCI-X added Message Signaled Interrupts, an interrupt system using writes to host-memory. In MSI-mode, the function's interrupt is not signaled by asserting an INTx line. Instead, the function performs a memory-write to a system-configured region in host-memory. Since the content and address are configured on a per-function basis, MSI-mode interrupts are dedicated instead of shared. A PCI-X system allows both MSI-mode interrupts and legacy INTx interrupts to be used simultaneously (though not by the same function.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-23 mm. The forewings are ochreous whitish with {{an oblique}} black <b>interrupted</b> <b>line</b> in the disc marking {{the end of}} the cell. There are undefined streaks of ochreous or fuscous suffusion around the upper and posterior margins of the cell, beneath the costa posteriorly, from the discal mark {{to the middle of the}} termen (sometimes double), and an oblique streak from the dorsum towards the base. A blackish mark is found on the costal edge before the apex, and one on the middle of the termen. The hindwings are ochreous whitish.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 25-28 mm. The forewings are whitish densely irrorated with grey, {{and with}} some blackish scales.

There is a circularly curved row of blackish dots in the disc beyond the brownish spot. The hindwings are dark-grey.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are rather dark grey, the veins lined black except towards the margins, the ground colour mixed whitish in the disc between the veins {{and there is}} a small blackish-grey spot on the base of the costa, some dull reddish-brown suffusion beneath the costa beyond this. Opposite suffused white spots are found on the costa at three-fourths and the tornus, connected by a slender straight <b>interrupted</b> <b>line</b> of white suffusion, with blotches of blackish-grey suffusion preceding these on the costa and dorsum. The hindwings are grey, thinly scaled anteriorly.|$|E
50|$|Multiple devices may share a level-triggered <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> if {{they are}} {{designed}} to.

There is a faint irregular line of brownish suffusion with some dots of black irroration running near the margin around the posterior two-fifths of the costa and termen. There is also a terminal row of small black dots. The hindwings are white, with a faint ochreous tinge.|$|E

5000|$|Level-triggered {{interrupt}} {{is favored}} by some {{because it is}} easy to share the <b>interrupt</b> request <b>line</b> without losing the interrupts, when multiple shared devices interrupt at the same time. Upon detecting assertion of the <b>interrupt</b> <b>line,</b> the CPU must search through the devices sharing the <b>interrupt</b> request <b>line</b> until one who triggered the interrupt is detected. After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> status to determine whether any other devices also needs service. If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids checking the remaining devices on the line. Since some devices interrupt more frequently than others, and other device interrupts are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of device checks is employed to increase efficiency. The original PCI standard mandated level-triggered interrupts because of this advantage of sharing interrupts.|$|R

There is also a trace of another line in the cell, and a fair sized mark on the inner margin. There is a trace of two very short black costal dashes beyond the cell, followed by a black wedge-shaped costal mark. A bare trace of a black subterminal line is mainly noticeable by a fair sized black mark on the inner margin almost in the tornus. The hindwings are uniform white.|$|E
