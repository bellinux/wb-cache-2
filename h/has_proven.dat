5|$|Just as the 1630s replica <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> {{to be an}} {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, the panorama <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and {{a great number of}} notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Although bobcats {{have been}} hunted {{extensively}} by humans, both for sport and fur, their population <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> resilient though declining in some areas. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.|$|E

30|$|Skof [39] <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> an {{asymptotic}} {{property of}} the additive mappings and Jung [34] <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> an asymptotic {{property of the}} quadratic mappings (see also [36]). We prove such a property also for the quadratic mappings.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the company}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> {{to be very}} profitable, they have had much less success at {{producing}} winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{was popular}} in Karnataka {{during the first}} {{millennium}} {{in places such as}} Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Gulbarga district in 1986 <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. There are Tibetan refugee camps in Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|Dams, weirs {{and other}} instream {{barriers}} block {{the migration of}} adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations.

5|$|Historian Vlad Georgescu {{writes that}} archaeological {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> {{the existence of}} about 60 settlements in Glad's duchy. Other historians, including Sălăgean and Pop, say that the earth-and-wooden or stone fortresses unearthed at Bulci, Cenad, Ilidia, Orșova, Pescari, and Vladimirescu were Glad's forts. Florin Curta says that the dating of these sites is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors have {{effective}} anti-tumor {{activity in}} cell culture, inducing apoptosis by disrupting the regulated degradation of pro-growth cell cycle proteins.

5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> more economical.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the riding, {{candidates}} have a tougher time running a campaign in Calgary Buffalo, as traditional campaign methods <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> relatively ineffective — i.e., placement of lawn signs, door knocking, and voter identification <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> to be of limited usefulness.|$|R
5|$|Tohari's trilogy Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk (The Dancer of Paruk Village; 1981–1985), which <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be {{his most}} famous, also dealt with the G30S and the PKI. However, unlike Kubah, parts of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk {{remained}} censored until 2003. Numerous novels dealing with G30S and the PKI, written by other authors, have also been published since Kubah.|$|E

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{copyright}} problems {{an official}} {{release of the}} animations <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> impossible. For the American release of the film, the rights to use of the Playboy bunny costume was denied and the rights to Electric Light Orchestra's music was consequently not sought. However, a laserdisc featuring Daicon III & IV Opening Animation was unofficially released in Japan as bonus material to a ¥16,000 art book of the animations. This laserdisc is considered rare and highly valuable among collectors, easily fetching prices over a thousand dollars on online auctions.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's {{tenure at}} Davis Polk {{is best known}} for her work as a defense {{attorney}} for Philip Morris during major litigation, including both civil lawsuits and U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil racketeering probes. She became a senior associate while working on Philip Morris litigation. While this time in her career <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> controversial, Gillibrand indicates her work for Philip Morris allowed her to take on multiple pro bono cases defending abused women and their children, as well as other cases defending tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.|$|E

5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E
5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be {{the more}} complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis {{with at least two}} generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
