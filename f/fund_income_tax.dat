In 1982, he reached an agreement with the United States Attorney's office in Newark, New Jersey under which he would avoid prison in exchange for his assistance in recording incriminating conversations with his former associates.

40|$|We re-examine {{the extent}} to which {{personal}} taxes on dividends are capitalized into the equity prices of domestic firms, using data from {{around the time of the}} 1997 U. K. dividend tax reform, which removed a significant tax credit for an important group of investors: U. K. pension funds. The tax-adjusted CAPM suggests that the impact should depend on an average of dividend tax rates across all investors, and that U. K. pension funds should reduce their holdings of the previously tax-favored asset: U. K. equities. Given that U. K. pension funds are small relative to the total size of the world capital market, a small open economy-type argument implies that the main effect of the reform would be to reduce U. K. pension funds'' ownership of U. K. equities, with little impact on their price. We present evidence which is consistent with these hypotheses. We discuss why previous research (Bell and Jenkinson, 2002) reached a different conclusion.

Using household survey evidence, the paper identifies which taxes are progressive and investigates whether tax reforms {{have made the}} poor better or worse off. Household survey analysis reveals {{that some of the}} tax reforms implemented in the 1990 s were generally pro-poor. The paper also examines business taxation and the actual tax burden on firms’ capital investment. The analysis demonstrates that, even when the country’s level of public revenue is low at the macroeconomic level, rapidly increasing taxation may pose a constraint to private investment at the microeconomic level.

40|$|Under current tax law, {{there can}} be {{considerable}} period-by-period divergence between a taxpayer's after-tax income and her desired or actual consumption.

40|$|A {{new report}} {{commissioned}} by Rasmuson Foundation {{as part of its}} Plan 4 Alaska campaign finds that while strategies currently proposed to close Alaska's $ 4 billion budget gap would significantly improve the state's fiscal standing, a diversified revenue strategy is needed this year to close the gap and equitably distribute financial impact. Rasmuson Foundation commissioned the report in response to comments from lawmakers about the dearth of economic data available to gauge the impact of various revenue scenarios. "Distributional Analyses of Revenue Options for Alaska" was produced by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a nonprofit, non-partisan research organization with a mission to ensure that elected officials, the media, and the general public have access to accurate, timely, and straightforward information that allows them to understand the effects of current and proposed tax policies. ITEP used Gov. Bill Walker's Sustainable Alaska Plan in its analysis, and evaluated its proposed reductions to the Permanent <b>Fund</b> dividend, and <b>income,</b> alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel tax increases to determine effects on Alaskans at different income levels. ITEP found that a fiscal plan that relied heavily on Permanent <b>Fund</b> earnings without <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> and other forms of taxation would disproportionately impact middle-income working families and low-income Alaskans. The report also examines a variety of options to derive more revenue from the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> and less from reductions to the dividend. Among the alternative <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> structures examined are a doubling of the governor's proposed tax, the implementation of a more progressive <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> proposed by Rep.

40|$|In {{an economy}} where {{different}} agents undertake simultaneous and interdependent investments, this paper models {{the possibility that}} the outcome where some players invest and others do not invest is sustained in Nash equilibrium. It is well known that in models where all goods are financed through prices charged by the suppliers (“tolls” in the case of transport infrastructures), there are only two coordination equilibria: the “Big push” equilibrium, where every agent involved invests; and the “Poverty trap”, whenever none invests. We consider a two person simultaneous game, where the Government decides whether to build a highway and a firm producing a composite good decides whether to use it. Instead of resorting to tolls, the infrastructure is <b>funded</b> through an <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> that falls on wages. Having the Government supplying the highway and the firm not using it is a Nash equilibrium if the employment generated by the construction of the highway is intermediate and the rate of the wage <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is high.

40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either social contributions or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, social contributions tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for social contributions. Other <b>funding</b> bases like <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than social contributions. The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between social contributions and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.
