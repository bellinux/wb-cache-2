40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study interfering products in fire debris analysis, including their identification and characterization. Different substrates were classified, burned, extracted and analyzed in order to identify all the interfering products that they may release. It has been shown that these products come from three different sources: substrate background products, pyrolysis products and possibly combustion products. Different parameters in the creation of these products were evaluated such as the extinguishment process as well as the weathering of the sample prior to the analysis. It has been shown that the presence of these products is not always constant and thus, makes it difficult to extrapolate data to similar cases. Furthermore, some of these products are similar to the ones found in ignitable liquids.
