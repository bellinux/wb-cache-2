5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{time their}} mating and birth seasons {{so that all}} weaning periods are {{synchronized}} to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' sifaka, {{has been shown to}} be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, but from May through June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Los Tigres del Norte {{recorded}} {{their performance}} on February 8, 2011, at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, California. Invitations {{to the event}} were issued to fans through MTV's website starting January 27, 2011. The audience waited four hours before the show started. In preparation to the show, the band sent a list of their songs to the featured performers {{and asked them to}} choose the song that better <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> own repertoire. The band performed twenty songs during the show, releasing only twelve on the standard edition of the album, and thirteen on the deluxe version.|$|E

25|$|Still another {{technique}} {{relies on}} a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and {{is very difficult for}} a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.|$|E
25|$|BEGINNING COUNTERACTION: The hero {{considers}} ways {{to resolve}} the issues, by seeking a needed magical item, rescuing those who are captured or otherwise thwarting the villain. This is a defining moment for the hero, one that shapes their further actions and marks the point when they begin to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> noble mantle.|$|E
25|$|High medieval {{surgeons}} like Mondino de Liuzzi pioneered anatomy in European {{universities and}} conducted systematic human dissections. Unlike pagan Rome, high medieval Europe {{did not have}} a complete ban on human dissection. However, Galenic influence was still so prevalent that Mondino and his contemporaries attempted to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> human findings into Galenic anatomy.|$|E

25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much on his skin. Tall riders also often were unable to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> legs on the small-sized boats, consequently resulting in them hanging off of {{the sides of the}} boats and being fractured during collisions.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E
25|$|The First Men in the Moon (1901) by H. G. Wells. A lunar {{population}} {{lives in a}} single harmonious society, where the offspring starts life in small containers.

25|$|Family BASIC is an {{implementation}} of BASIC for the Famicom, packaged with a keyboard. Similar in concept to the Atari 2600 BASIC cartridge, {{it allows the}} user to program their own games, which can be saved on an included cassette recorder. Nintendo of America rejected releasing Famicom BASIC in the US {{because it did not}} think it <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> primary marketing demographic of children.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{reasons for}} the increased thickness have not been established. One explanation is that thicker penises are an adaptation to a corresponding increase in vaginal size. The vaginal canal {{is believed to have}} expanded in humans to accommodate the larger size of a newborn's cranium. Women may then have sexually selected men with penises large enough to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> vagina, to provide sexual stimulation and ensure ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a variety of {{independent}} study and research opportunities that give Honors students the chance to design courses that <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> special needs and interests and to work one-on-one with faculty.

50|$|Odonianism was {{developed}} by anarchist philosopher Laia Odo, {{who lived in the}} propertarian nation-state of A-Io on the planet of Urras. Odonians speak the Pravic language, which <b>fits</b> <b>their</b> outlook and social structure and is described in considerable detail.|$|R
25|$|The former wagon {{house in}} the barn complex now houses {{educational}} programs. Future plans include a reconstruction of the wagon house and a stabilization of the main barn, to better <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> role as year-round centers for education. Olana has been cited as an innovative example of a public-private partnership. Olana advocates the preservation of its viewshed by encouraging donations of scenic easements on properties and by discouraging development of industrial projects, such as a proposed cement plant and a proposed power plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Taurus was highly customizable by the buyer to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> needs, as it had {{a large number of}} options, as well as being available in three different configurations. This meant that the {{interior of}} the Taurus could be spartan or luxurious, depending on the buyer's choice of options. The interior equipment depended on model. The most basic model, the L (see below), came standard with just an AM radio and a front cloth bench seat, while the LX, the highest model, came with a large amount of standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, {{the philosopher}} Hermann Ulrici {{wrote that the}} play and its {{depiction}} of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life {{is nothing but a}} dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of parody about class differences.|$|E
50|$|The {{pieces were}} shaped and {{designed}} {{with the intent}} of reflecting artistically the best traditions of Puerto Rican culture and history. Lasky encouraged the artisans he stewarded to express themselves as they saw <b>fit.</b> <b>Theirs</b> was a collaborative effort.|$|R
50|$|Apple's {{very first}} offering, the Apple I, was {{initially}} {{sold as a}} naked PCB without a keyboard (or a case), although some resellers and users <b>fitted</b> <b>their</b> own cases with built-in keyboards and Apple cooperated {{with at least one}} such reseller.|$|R
50|$|Many people confuse {{modification}} of policy language {{so that it}} <b>fits</b> <b>their</b> organization with changing the model itself. Model-consistent practice is assessed by considering whether board performance aligns with the model's principles, not by reviewing the policy language that is adopted.|$|R
25|$|When {{individuals}} assimilate new information, they incorporate it into {{an already}} existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change {{their perceptions of the}} experiences to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> internal representations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{standards}} for mounting disc brake calipers. I.S. (International Standard) is different for 160mm and 203mm rotor and differs between forks with a QR and 20mm through axle. The post-mount standard also differs by disc size and axle type. Many incompatible variants were produced over the years, mostly by fork manufacturers. The mount {{used on the}} Rockshox Boxxer is the most typical of these specialty mounts, but most fork manufactures now use either the IS or post-mount standard for their current forks. As a point of reference, Hayes currently sells no fewer than 13 different adapters to <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> brakes to various mounting patterns.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander's {{theories}} {{were influenced}} by the Greek mythical tradition, and by some ideas of Thales– the father of philosophy– {{as well as by}} observations made by older civilizations in the East (especially by the Babylonian astrologers). All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, therefore they could <b>fit</b> <b>their</b> ideas into a tolerably elastic system.|$|E
50|$|Although most TRX tires were {{produced}} by Michelin, a few sizes {{were made by}} Avon, Continental, Goodyear (mainly for the American market) and Dunlop. Dunlop <b>fitted</b> <b>their</b> version of the trx tire as standard equipment on austin montegos and austin mini metros.|$|R
