It was a students team competition in Kruševac. The period between 1952 and 1971 was marked by the school competition.|$|R
50|$|The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play's</b> {{origin and}} stage premier cannot be fixed with certainty, though {{scholars}} have interpreted the text's contemporary allusions as indicating a {{date in the}} early 1620s, with c. 1622 commonly given as a good approximation. The records of Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, license an otherwise-unknown play called A Match or No Match on 6 April 1624; similarity of authorship data (see below) suggests that A Match or No Match is an alternative title for A Match at Midnight, and its <b>date</b> <b>of</b> 1624 conforms to the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play</b> to the early 1620s.|$|R

50|$|Middleton {{borrowed}} the main plot of No Wit from a 1589 play, a comedy by Giambattista Della Porta titled La Sorella ("The Sister").

Afraid that his dad would find them, he asks David to look after them, but he hides them {{in one of his}} niece's dolls. However, when Bethany (Amy & Emily Walton) {{swallows}} one, David decides to protect his friend and bails Darryl out by taking the blame for possession. After a brief flirtation in the Rovers with barmaid Lauren Wilson (Lucy Evans), Darryl begins dating her. After a few <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>playing</b> hard to get, they begin seeing each other on a more regular basis. He often pays for their dates and drinks, even though Mel tells him that his money is the only reason she is interested. Their involvement with each other comes to an end when Lauren becomes angry with him having no money, and states they were never an item.|$|R

She appeared twice in the French crime series R.I.S, police scientifique, once in 2009 and once in 2012. In 2012 she <b>played</b> the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> Laurent, <b>played</b> by Maurice Barthélémy, in Happiness Never Comes Alone.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play</b> is {{not known}} with certainty, and its early {{performance}} history is largely a blank. The title page of the 1638 quarto states that the work was [...] "sundry times acted at the Red Bull and other theaters, with general and good applause." [...] Okes' dedication <b>of</b> the <b>play</b> to the guild of shoemakers also mentions the play's popularity, and states that [...] "some twenty years agone, {{it was in the}} fashion." [...] This suggests a date c. 1618 for the play's origin, though the [...] "twenty years" [...] figure could be only an approximation. Commentators have suggested <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> authorship as early as c. 1608.|$|R
25|$|Other {{critics have}} {{attempted}} to use more scientific methods to determine the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play.</b> For example, Gary Taylor has employed stylometry, particularly the study of contractions, colloquialisms, rare words and function words. Taylor concludes that the entire play except Act 3, Scene 2 was written just after Henry VI, Part 2 and Henry VI, Part 3, which he assigns to late 1591 or early 1592. As such, Taylor settles on a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> mid-1592 for Titus. He also argues that 3.2, which is only found in the 1623 Folio text, was written contemporaneously with Romeo and Juliet, in late 1593.|$|R
50|$|One comic {{moment in}} the play deals with a servant not {{realising}} that poetry featuring references to dildos is vulgar, presumably from not knowing what the word means. This play and Ben Jonson's play The Alchemist (1610) are typically cited as the first usage of the word in publication. The Alchemist was printed first, but {{the debate about the}} <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play's</b> composition makes it unclear which was the first scripted use of the word, which is much older.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} much {{critical}} debate concerning the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play</b> since David Bevington’s assertion in 1968 that {{it was written in}} the 1520s. Greg Walker suggested that it was written and performed between 1529-30 but later modified this to 1533 {{on the basis of the}} argument made by Axton and Happe in the introduction to their edition <b>of</b> Heywood’s <b>plays.</b> [...] The play is often dated on internal evidence, particularly the so-called ‘new moon’ speech which seems to allude to the changing of King Henry VIII’s consort from Catherine of Aragon to Anne Boleyn and his quest for a male heir.|$|R
50|$|No firm {{information}} <b>of</b> the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> Four <b>Plays</b> in One {{is available}} in the historical record. On general considerations, scholars have provisionally dated the play to the 1608-13 period. Of the four playlets, the last, The Triumph of Time, is the most masque-like, {{even to the point of}} featuring an anti-masque. Since Ben Jonson effectively invented the anti-masque in The Masque of Queens, which was performed and published early in 1609, it seems unlikely that Four Plays in One could be earlier than that.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2002, all U.S. Opens {{had been}} staged at private golf or country clubs or at privately owned resorts that, while {{open to the}} public, were very {{expensive}} {{for the public to}} play, with greens fees of several hundred dollars per round. The USGA's choice of Bethpage was seen as an egalitarian move; as of 2010, Bethpage Black's weekend price for 18 holes was $75 for New York State residents, and $150 for non-residents. There are a number of ways for golfers to secure a round on the always popular Black Course. To register for a tee time, guests must have their driver's license on file with the park's reservation system. Note that New York residents can reserve a tee time seven days in advance, while out-of-state residents can only reserve tee times starting at 7:00 pm Eastern Time two days before the intended <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>play.</b> Walk-ups are also accepted, although this option often requires that golfers wait in line in the parking lot through the night.|$|R

Wilson and the TX Blind Dates returned abroad for a second European tour in 2014 where they played Czech Republic, Germany, France, Belgium, and headlined Sunday night at the OFF Fest in Katowice, Poland. The touring band consisted of Patrick Healy (percussion, vocals), Chef Pittman (drums), Sam Vandelinder (guitar, organ, synthesizer), Paul Millar (bass guitar, synthesizer), and T.W.Bond (keyboards).|$|R
50|$|The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play</b> is {{a matter}} of deep {{uncertainty}} and widespread dispute; scholars have ventured dates from 1607 to 1621. If Beaumont was one of the original authors, the first version of the drama obviously must have pre-dated his 1613 retirement and 1616 death. The title page of the first quarto states that the play was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. This may refer to the revised version; both Fletcher and Massinger worked for the King's Men through much of their careers.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play's</b> authorship {{and first}} {{performance}} is uncertain, though some scholars cite 1633 {{as the most}} likely year. A mention of [...] "woman antics" [...] in Act III may refer {{to the performance of}} Walter Montague's masque The Shepherd's Paradise by Queen Henrietta Maria and her ladies in waiting in January 1633. (The production of that masque was innovative in that the aristocratic women in the cast performed spoken parts, rather than merely appearing in or dancing in the masque, which had been common for two generations.) ...|$|R

Parke owned theatrical companies and assisted Hulette in making one hit after another.|$|R
5000|$|While the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>play's</b> origin {{cannot be}} fixed with certainty, Philaster must pre-date 1611, {{based on its}} mention by John Davies in his Scourge of Folly. (Davies's book was entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 October 1610, and was printed soon after.) Scholars {{generally}} assign the play to the 1608-10 interval, with [...] "the middle to late summer of 1610" [...] as perhaps the most likely specific period. The play was acted by the King's Men at both the Globe and Blackfriars theatres, and was performed at court twice {{in the winter of}} 1612-13.|$|R
5000|$|The Broken Heart is a Caroline era tragedy {{written by}} John Ford, and first {{published}} in 1633. [...] "The play has long vied with Tis Pity Shes a Whore as Fords greatest work...the supreme reach of his genius...." [...] The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plays</b> authorship is uncertain, and is generally placed in the 1625-32 period by scholars. The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted by the Kings Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. The text is preceded by the motto [...] "Fide Honor," [...] an anagram for [...] "John Forde," [...] which Ford employs in other <b>of</b> his <b>plays</b> as well.
