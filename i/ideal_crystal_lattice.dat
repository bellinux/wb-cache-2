40|$|Coherent X-ray {{diffraction}} imaging is {{a rapidly}} advancing form of microscopy: diffraction patterns, measured using the latest third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, can be inverted to obtain full three-dimensional {{images of the}} interior density within nanocrystals. Diffraction from an <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> results in an identical copy of this continuous diffraction pattern at every Bragg peak. This symmetry is broken {{by the presence of}} strain fields, which arise from the epitaxial contact forces that are inevitable whenever nanocrystals are prepared on a substrate. When strain is present, the diffraction copies at different Bragg peaks are no longer identical and contain additional information, appearing as broken local inversion symmetry about each Bragg point. Here we show that one such pattern can nevertheless be inverted to obtain a 'complex' crystal density, whose phase encodes a projection of the lattice deformation. A lead nanocrystal was crystallized in ultrahigh vacuum from a droplet on a silica substrate and equilibrated close to its melting point. A three-dimensional image of the density, obtained by inversion of the coherent X-ray diffraction, shows the expected facetted morphology, but in addition reveals a real-space phase that is consistent with the three-dimensional evolution of a deformation field arising from interfacial contact forces. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale will have profound consequences for our fundamental understanding of grain interactions and defects in crystalline materials. Our method of measuring and inverting diffraction patterns from nanocrystals represents a vital step towards the ultimate goal of atomic resolution single-molecule imaging that is a prominent justification for development of X-ray free-electron lasers...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} an {{impurity}} embedded in an ionic crystal can {{give rise to}} a novel kind of local states. These states exist within a polariton gap of a material and are a mix of excitations of the crystal, such as phonons or excitons, and the transverse electromagnetic field.

Typeset using REVTEX 1 Impurities or other defects in otherwise <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattices</b> have an considerable affect on dynamical properties of host crystals. One of the most remarkable dynamical effects caused by defects is the occurrence of local states within frequency regions forbidden for excitations of the host materials.

40|$|Summary. Strong {{deformation}} and fracture {{are very}} difficult to describe using macroscopic continuum methods. Lack of a material continuousness makes description of such processes to be a serious challenge. In the presented paper the onset of the material fracture is studied from both micro- and macroscopic points of view. First an <b>ideal</b> infinite <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> is considered. Transfer from microstructure to continuum mechanics is made using long-wave approximation. This allows obtaining nonlinear continuum equations of the infinite crystal under finite uniform deformation. These equations are found without limitation to the space dimension. For the stability verification a small deformation is superposed to a finite deformation of the <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice</b> being described by the obtained nonlinear macroscopic equations. Criterions of the material stability and their relevance to the crystal structure are obtained...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work we discuss {{arguments}} {{in favour of}} the view that massive fermions represent dislocations (i. e. topological solitons) in discrete space-time, with Burgers vectors parallel to the axis of time. If {{we assume that the}} symmetrical parts of tensors of distortions (i. e. derivatives of atomic displacements on coordinates) and the mechanical stresses are equal to zero, then the equations of the field theory of dislocations assume the form of the Maxwell equations. If we consider these tensors as symmetrical, we obtain the equations of the theory of gravitation, and it appears that the sum of the tensor of distortions and of the pseudo-Euclidean metrical tensor is the analogue of the metrical tensor. It is shown that we can also get Dirac equation with four-fermion interaction in the framework of the field theory of dislocations. This model explains quantization of electrical charge: this is proportional to the topological charge of dislocation, and this charge accepts quantized values because of the discrete structure of the 4 -dimensional lattice. The concept of discrete (in other words quantized) space-time has been discussed in physics of elementary particles already for a long time. One of variants of this approach is the lattice quantum field theory, within the framework of which significant success was already achieved. This theory is based on approximation of space-time by a discrete lattice, which is actually 4 -dimensional analogue of <b>crystal</b> <b>lattices.</b> But from the theory of solid state {{it is well known that}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattices</b> do not exist in a nature. The real lattices always contain defects, in particular, dislocations. From the geometrical point of view the dislocations are the one-dimensional topological solitons. The first homotopy group which classifies them is the group of translations. Therefore it is quite natural to assume that similar defects should exist in 4 -dimensional space-time lattice.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  1, for all SL samples, the {{measured}} tilt angles, α_ 0 ^SL, are larger than the Nagai angle predicted by Eq. (3). Huang et al. [15] reported that the tilt angle of the GaN layer obeys the Nagai model if the misorientation angles of the sapphire substrate are small. The small angle miscut is in fact the required approximation for the classical Nagai theory. However, despite the small misorientation angles of our GaN substrate, the classic Nagai theory {{does not appear to be}} valid for our samples. First of all, the small miscut approximation of the classical Nagai model only considers the out-of-plane lattice mismatch between two <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>lattices</b> at one interface, which would treat a superlattice as some average alloy. In general, the multiple layers of the SLs require a more complicated consideration of the difference in the out-of-plane lattice mismatch as well as a consideration of the in-plane mismatch. This was explicitly demonstrated for GaN/AlN layers grown on Si (111) substrates with different misorientation angles [18, 19]. Additionally, these models only consider tilting or lattice misorientation of single epitaxial interfaces. For our GaN/AlN SLs grown on vicinal GaN (0001) substrate, the deposition of each additional layer is characterized by (i) the presence of elastic and plastic relaxation components [5], due to the in-plane lattice mismatch with the resulting layers below it, and (ii) the tilting or a triclinic unit cell deformation, due to the out-of-plane lattice mismatch with the resulting layers below. The triclinic deformation of the unit cells of fully strained InGaN grown on vicinal GaN (0001) substrates was reported in [17]. A full analysis including these considerations is beyond the scope of this paper but should explain the result that the SL peak of S 5 is not vertically aligned with the GaN substrate peak (Fig.  2 (a)), even though S 5 is below the critical thickness for plastic relaxation and is pseudomorphic with and fully strained to the substrate. The final result of this Nagai tilt is only a small additional elastic relaxation component at an interface, but here, we have shown that this elastic relaxation pathway can be considerable after the addition of many interfaces through the growth of a SL.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an electron system {{under conditions of}} strong Anderson localization, taking into account interelectron long-range Coulomb repulsion. We have established that with the electron density going to zero the Coulomb interaction brings {{the arrangement of the}} Anderson localized electrons closer and closer to an <b>ideal</b> (Wigner) <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice,</b> provided the temperature is sufficiently low and the dimension of the system is > 1. The ordering occurs despite the fact that a random spread of the energy levels of the localized one-electron states, exceeding the mean Coulomb energy per electron, renders it impossible the electrons to be self-localized due to their mutual Coulomb repulsion This differs principally the Coulomb ordered Anderson localized electron system (COALES) from Wigner crystal, Wigner glass, and any other ordered electron or hole system that results from the Coulomb self-localization of electrons/holes. The residual disorder inherent to COALES is found to bring about a multi-valley ground-state degeneration akin to that in spin glass. With the electron density increasing, COALES is revealed to turn into Wigner glass or a glassy state of a Fermi-glass type depending on the width of the random spread of the electron levels.

40|$|Deviations {{from the}} <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, i. e., {{intrinsic}} or extrinsic defects, modify {{the dynamics of}} a crystalline lattice among many other material properties. As a consequence, additional modes may occur in Raman spectra, Raman-forbidden modes may become Raman active, and the shape {{as well as the}} position in the frequency of the Raman signals may change. The impacts of perturbations of the <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> structure on Raman spectra are addressed within the framework of this thesis. Crystalline ZnO samples are investigated using Raman spectroscopy. It is found that all experimental results are consistent with the laws of conservation as well as the Raman activity and the symmetry selection-rules established for an <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> structure. With this in mind, the samples studied should be free of defects and have an <b>ideal</b> hexagonal <b>crystal</b> <b>lattice.</b> In reality, there are no perfect crystals as entropy always leads to the formation of defects [6]. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} nominally undoped ZnO is often intrinsically n-type conducting due to intrinsic and/or, more likely, due to extrinsic defects [7 - 10]. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy is not sensitive to such kinds of defects at the concentration level present in the ZnO samples studied and in the frequency range considered here in experiment. The situation is different when ZnO is intentionally doped with nitrogen. Raman spectra of nitrogen doped ZnO exhibit five additional modes independent of the growth technique applied. Various attempts to explain the appearance of the nitrogen-related modes are reviewed [11 - 19]. A promising approach is the assignment of the N-related modes to silent ZnO phonons induced by the breakdown of the translational symmetry of the lattice [19]. The Raman active ZnO phonons and the N-related modes are analyzed with respect to the amount of nitrogen incorporated in ZnO as well as their behavior upon hydrostatic pressure applied and sample rotation. The findings reveal discrepancies for the silent B modes between the outcome of ab initio calculations and the nitrogen-related modes observed in experiments. In addition, their symmetry characteristics cannot be represented in a conclusive picture by silent B modes of wurtzite ZnO if the assumption is valid that the perturbation introduced by nitrogen on an anion site is large enough to manipulate the Raman activity and the symmetry character of the extended lattice modes. Thus, the assignment of the additional signals to silent B modes of wurtzite ZnO becomes disputable. Consistent with all experimental findings, the formation of clusters containing N atoms/ions, in particular, of Zn 3 N 2 -like clusters that are formed when the solubility limit of N on O sites is exceeded, are proposed as the origin of the additional signals. Raman spectra of crystalline Cu 2 O are often dominated by Raman-forbidden lattice vibrations rather than by the single Raman-active phonon predicted by group theory for the <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> structure [4]. A group theoretical analysis of the symmetry reduction due to the presence of defects demonstrates that the copper split vacancy, a point defect particular to Cu 2 O, introduces Raman activity for all phonons that are Raman forbidden. The symmetry characteristics of the lattice vibrations observed in Raman spectra corroborate this assumption. These findings are surprising: Raman spectra of most crystalline materials are consistent with the laws of conservation as well as the Raman activity and the symmetry selection-rules established for an <b>ideal</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, despite the considerable amount of defects present in crystalline materials as shown for pure ZnO. The special role of the split vacancy may be due to the strong perturbation introduced by it compared to simple point defects, which is indicated by DFT calculations for supercell defect structures. However, resonant Raman scattering mechanisms cannot entirely be ruled out to alter the Raman activity and symmetry selection-rules such that all phonons become Raman active, since the analyzed Raman spectra are dependent on the excitation frequency. The theoretical discussions and experimental investigations within the present thesis demonstrate that Raman scattering is influenced in many different ways by defects in the material under study. A thoughtful analysis of the corresponding Raman spectra may give insight into occurring defects and their properties. In particular, Raman experiments upon sample or plane of polarization rotation of extended lattice vibrations and defect-related modes may reveal their symmetry character and accordingly information about their origin...|$|R
