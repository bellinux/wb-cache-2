The optimization of the flow path and structure of solar <b>heat</b> <b>collecting</b> ceramic <b>plate</b> can strengthen the heat transfer greatly. This study aimed to obtain the optimization data of the heat transfer characteristics in order to design more efficient solar collecting system. The internal flow path and structure was modified based on the computational fluid dynamics and numerical heat transfer. The result has proved that the internal flow field was made uniform with little increase of the resistance loss, but achieved more efficiency of the heat transfer...|$|R

If dust cake removal from the <b>collecting</b> <b>plates</b> surface is not enough, the dust collection effectivity decreases.

40|$|Granular {{boom sprayer}} {{has been used}} by large scaled farmers for centuries. This machine is used to repel or {{fertilize}} their crops. In MARDI, they used 3 types of fertilizer that is Nitrogen, N, Phosphorus, P and Potassium, K. Those 3 types of particles have been simulated by using Ansys software and the results show that potassium, K fertilizer not scattered to the ground and the others 2 fertilizers are conversely. The uniformity of the distribution of granular fertilizer was carried out with a reasonable range of variables. Various methods have been used to study the efficiency of the spray boom design on through simulation software and lab approach. In this work, the simulation of the particles in the boom sprayer is performed from the boom sprayer entering until the exit and distributed to the ground. The simulation is performed by using ANSYS CFX based on the Taguchi method. Taguchi method have been used in this study. For the orthogonal array, since this case study consists of 4 level and 5 factor, L‟ 16 was used for the simulation process. This simulation utilize only one fertilizer that contained all types of the basic NPK fertilizer. The parameters are involved the granular diameter size, air velocity at the inlet, blow head distance, height of <b>collecting</b> <b>plate</b> and width of <b>collecting</b> <b>plate.</b> Results shows that the air velocity must be kept higher when the diameter of particle increases. <b>Collecting</b> <b>plates</b> with excessive height and width can cause the velocity fertilizer to drop and the particles fail to distribute well. Furthermore, furthers distance between the boom section can also cause the particles to scattered unevenly onto the ground. The most desired simulation result was achieved with 1. 5 mm diameter particles, air velocity 8 m/s, distance between boom section is 200 mm and height and width of <b>collecting</b> <b>plate</b> is 14 mm and 10 mm.
