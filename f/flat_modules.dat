2500|$|While {{projective}} {{covers for}} modules {{do not always}} exist, it was speculated that for general rings, every module would have a flat cover, that is, every module M would be the epimorphic image of a <b>flat</b> <b>module</b> F such that every map from a <b>flat</b> <b>module</b> onto M factors through F, and any endomorphism of F over M is an automoprhism. This flat cover conjecture was explicitly first stated in [...] The conjecture {{turned out to be}} true, resolved positively and proved simultaneously by L. Bican, R. El Bashir and E. Enochs.

40|$|The {{lamination}} of OPV modules to corrugated {{roof cladding}} has been undertaken. The 3 -dimensional {{form of the}} cladding provides three advantages for outdoor OPV deployment; firstly the ‘footprint’ of the solar cell is reduced, which leads to ∼ 10 % improved power conversion (PCE) efficiency per unit area. Secondly, the oblique angle performance is enhanced, leading to increased output {{in the early morning}} and evening. Indoor characterisation showed a 9 -fold enhancement in efficiency was obtainable, when compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>module.</b> Thirdly, an improvement in performance under diffuse lighting conditions was measured, when compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>module.</b> The average daily yield of the 3 D module was 17 – 29 % higher than a <b>flat</b> <b>module,</b> with higher relative enhancements observed on cloudier days. Geographically, the 3 D module appears to be well-suited to countries with a high latitude, due to the enhanced diffuse light levels and the fact that tilting the module in both ‘latitude’ and ‘longitude’ directions away from normal, leads to the best achievable enhancement in solar cell performance. The approach set out in this paper could yield a product that has profound advantages over existing BIPV products and is potentially applicable to other flexible inorganic solar cell technologies...|$|R
