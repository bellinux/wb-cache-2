40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} information-processing and leadership styles in school principals via an integration of two theories: <b>Epstein</b> <b>s</b> cognitive-experiential self theory (CEST) and Bass and Avolio s full-range leadership theory (FRLT). The series of five studies provide empirical support for a CEST-transformational leadership model. Implications for educational leadership at the theoretical and practical level are discussed. Establishing a positive connection between information-processing, transformational leadership, and the choice of conflict-handling styles appears to promote effective school leadership that, in turn, is thought to influence teachers job satisfaction and students learning outcomes. Being first to consider school leadership via the two perspectives of CEST and transformational leadership, this book is novel and is of direct relevance to educational leadership and all engaged in coaching for transformational leadership development...|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: This is a {{prospective}} study. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of our study}} is to identify whether vertebral arteries (VA), normal or aberrant, are routinely described in cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) interpretations. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VA injury is a serious complication of anterior cervical spine surgery. Aberrant VA anatomy is a potential cause of such complications. Therefore, VA anatomy should be evaluated in cervical MRIs. METHODS: Six neuroradiologists were blinded to the study design {{and were asked to}} interpret 79 cervical MRIs. Of these, 39 had aberrant VAs, whereas 40 had normal VAs. Initially, the indications for the study included only a description of patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>symptoms.</b> The radiologists were then given the same MRIs with different indications. This time, the indications included the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>symptoms,</b> a request for annotations on the VA, and a definition of VA anomaly. All of the MRI interpretations were then evaluated for the frequency and accuracy of VA description. RESULTS: When the indications for the study did not specifically request a comment on VAs, the VA was never described (0...|$|R

This study was undertaken to further elicit {{the natural history of}} this condition and the presence of concomitant reactive airways disease through clinical profiling and pulmonary function testing.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Epstein.</b> <b>S</b> in 1942 {{described}} PMLE {{under the}} name of Prurigo aestivalis. He first hypothesised that PMLE represents a form of delayed-type hypersensitivity response to an endogenous, cutaneous UV-induced antigen, because of the hours or days delay between sun exposure and manifestation of symptoms, and the histological appearance of lesional skin. Firm evidence; however, has been lacking and the responsible allergen has not been identified. PMLE a specific entity encompassing six clinical manifestations: Small erythematous papulovesicles, eczematous lesions, large papules, oedematous plaques, prurigo nodules and erythema multiforme-like lesions. The histological features of PMLE are characteristic, but not pathognomonic and vary with the different clinical presentation. A sincere effort has been put in this study to understand the clinical and histopathological features of polymorphic light lesions. The study is intended to help the practising physicians and dermatologists to diagnose the pathology on time and intervene before it develops into complications. METHODS Material for the present study consisted of 100 cases of clinically diagnosed untreated cases of polymorphous light eruption, who were attending the skin and STD and Leprosy Department, Kakatiya Medical College, Warangal, during January 2014 to Dec 2014 were selected for this study.
