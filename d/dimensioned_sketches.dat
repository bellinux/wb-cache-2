DISCUSSION The hammer-impact, spiked-base, shear-wave source is a modification of the Kirk shear-wave source (Hasbrouck, 1977) in which the vane of the Kirk source is replaced by two sets of spikes positioned at 30 ° inter-vals at a fixed radius from a central-location spike (fig. 3) « When operating on hard surfaces and outcrops, it is difficult to chip out a narrow triangular trench to accept the keel of the Kirk source.

Introduction Constraint-based sketching has become a major design paradigm in mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD). Conceptually, a rough sketch is prepared by the user and annotated with geometric constraints such as distance, angle, parallelism, tangency, concentricity, etc. The sketch is then instantiated to the precise specifications implied by the constraints, and is interpreted as a profile. This profile, in turn, defines a solid or solid operation through lofting or sweeping such as a linear extrusion, revolution about an axis, or a general sweep along a space curve.

We propose a High-speed Router-based Anomaly and Intrusion Detection system, HRAID, leveraging our recent work on data streaming computation and in particular, sketches. We analyze the attributes in TCP/IP headers and select an optimal small set of metrics for flow-level sketch-based traffic monitoring and intrusion detection. To overcome the limitations of existing single <b>dimension</b> <b>sketches,</b> we design an efficient and accurate two-dimensional sketch to distinguish different types of attacks for mitigation. We further propose several heuristics to reduce the false positive rate for SYN flooding detection. Simulation with several router traces shows that HRAID is highly accurate, efficient, uses very small memory, and can effectively detect multiple types of attacks simultaneously. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, HRAID is the first online flow-level anomaly/intrusion detection system for high-speed networks, even for the worst case traffic of 40 -byte-packet streams with each packet forming a flow.

Although the maintenance of large data stores can be guided by advice obtained from data quality evaluations, this technique can be only partly applied to test data inventories. Assessing test data quality is difficult, as the well-known data quality dimensions are not applicable in an easy fashion. For example, an otherwise good value of 100 % for correctness would not allow to store erroneous test data items. The need for data quality dimensions dedicated to assessing test data quality can’t be satisfied by well-known data quality dimensions.

40|$|Dimensioning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stages in design development. It is traditionally learned through the sketches or drawings of parts to which the student adds their dimensional values. However, there are no computer teaching applications which are specifically oriented towards teaching the student how to dimension and showing what alternatives exist for such dimensioning. A methodology has been developed based on a computer application which in turn is based on variational geometry, which will allow students to design a sketch and obtain the different alternative dimensions, in line with ISO 129. Creating sketches through conceptual design implies the use of constraints. When developing conceptual design-based CAD programs, two independent modules must be created: on the one hand, the sketcher module, which must define the model's geometrical constraints and interpret the user's intention through a system of rules. On the other hand, the calculation module which must solve the final geometry and eventually dimension the mechanical part. The proposed approach establishes the complete geometry and constraints of a sketch and relates it with the complete <b>dimensioning</b> of the <b>sketch.</b> The developed methodology gives as a result a complete and consistent <b>dimensioning</b> of the <b>sketch</b> following the rules established by a standard like ISO.

Given n samples, the time and space complexity of computing the KRR estimate scale as O(n^ 3) and O(n^ 2) respectively, and so is prohibitive in many cases. We propose approximations of KRR based on m-dimensional randomized sketches of the kernel matrix, and study how small the projection dimension m can be chosen while still preserving minimax optimality of the approximate KRR estimate. For various classes of randomized sketches, including those based on Gaussian and randomized Hadamard matrices, we prove that it suffices to choose the <b>sketch</b> <b>dimension</b> m proportional to the statistical dimension (modulo logarithmic factors).

Starting with a study of the evolution and different interpretations of the spatial concept of informality, we moved from a perspective based on the traditional dichotomies to concentrate on the relations between formal and informal. In this intermediate space the presence of these two <b>dimensions</b> can <b>sketch</b> out spheres of action and foster the emergence of different perspectives from an urban, cultural, social and economic viewpoint. Urban informality challenges the formalisation of the current design and planning processes that, based on abstract techniques and theories, create a system devoid of contact with reality. Informal urban processes appear to be an important perspective from which to depart to reconfigure criteria and approaches linked with space design. In this respect, urban design—thanks to its ability to intercept single and episodic phenomena, tendencies or behaviours and steer them towards perspectives of change—is subject to a dual tension between the formal sphere of knowledge and the need to analyse and endorse reality in its variety of informal aspects and forms. This approach fosters the establishment of alternative points of view and brings forth a different awareness, strictly connected with action, which can contribute to defining perspectives for the city.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of what gravitational theory could supersede General Relativity has been central in theoretical physics for decades. Many disparate alternatives have been proposed motivated by cosmology, quantum gravity and phenomenological angles, and {{have been subjected to}} tests derived from cosmological, solar system and pulsar observations typically restricted to linearized regimes. Gravitational waves from compact binaries provide new opportunities to probe these theories in the strongly gravitating/highly dynamical regimes. To this end however, a reliable understanding of the dynamics in such a regime is required. Unfortunately, most of these theories fail to define well posed initial value problems, which prevents at face value from meeting such challenge. In this work, we introduce a consistent program able to remedy this situation. This program is inspired in the approach to "fixing" viscous relativistic hydrodynamics introduced by Israel and Stewart in the late 70 's.
