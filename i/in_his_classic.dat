5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus Banksia, and {{was divided into}} three sections. George placed Banksia coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section Banksia on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical arrangement of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 1776, Boone's {{daughter}} Jemima and {{two other}} teenaged girls were captured outside Boonesborough by an Indian war party, who carried the girls north towards the Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Boone {{and a group of}} men from Boonesborough followed in pursuit, finally catching up with them two days later. Boone and his men ambushed the Indians while they were stopped for a meal, rescuing the girls and driving off their captors. The incident became the most celebrated event of Boone's life. James Fenimore Cooper created a fictionalized version of the episode <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826).|$|E

25|$|George Bentham's taxonomic {{arrangement}} of Banksia {{was published in}} 1870, in Volume 5 of Bentham's Flora Australiensis.

25|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). George reinstated Meissner's Eubanksia and Isostylis, giving them subgeneric rank. By this time, however, {{the rules of}} botanical nomenclature had been formalised {{in such a way}} that Eubanksia was required to take the autonym B.subg. Banksia.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). He reinstated B.ser. Abietinae, placing it within B.sect. Oncostylis, and defining it as containing only those species with entire, linear leaves with revolute margins, and having roughly spherical inflorescences. Thus three species with elongate cylindrical inflorescences were moved into separate series.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> {{study of}} the Nuer of {{southern}} Sudan, E. E. Evans-Pritchard suggested rinderpest might have affected the Nuer's social organization {{before and during the}} 1930s. Since the Nuer were pastoralists, much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry, and bride-prices were paid in cattle; prices may have changed as a result of cattle depletion. Rinderpest might also have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). He reinstated B.ser. Quercinae, placing it within B.sect. Banksia, and redefining it as containing those species with awned perianths, and beaked follicles. Initially, the series contained three species, but in 1988 George moved B.baueri (Woolly Orange Banksia) {{into its own}} series, B.ser. Bauerinae, leaving just B.quercifolia (Oak-leaved Banksia) and B.oreophila (Western Mountain Banksia) in B.ser. Quercinae.|$|E
25|$|Donald Olding Hebb FRS (July 22, 1904 – August 20, 1985) was a Canadian {{psychologist}} who was {{influential in the}} area of neuropsychology, where he sought to understand how the function of neurons contributed to psychological processes such as learning. He {{is best known for his}} theory of Hebbian learning, which he introduced <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> 1949 work The Organization of Behavior. He has been described as the father of neuropsychology and neural networks. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Hebb as the 19th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Around the 1970s {{the study}} of market {{failures}} came into focus with {{the study of}} information asymmetry. In particular three authors emerged from this period: Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz. Akerlof considered the problem of bad quality cars driving good quality cars {{out of the market}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> “The Market for Lemons” (1970) {{because of the presence of}} asymmetrical information between buyers and sellers. Michael Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, because since employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} a soapy {{solution}} {{to act as a}} detergent has been recognized for centuries. However, it is only {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century that the constitution of such solutions was scientifically studied. Pioneering work in this area was carried out by James William McBain at the University of Bristol. As early as 1913, he postulated the existence of “colloidal ions” to explain the good electrolytic conductivity of sodium palmitate solutions. These highly mobile, spontaneously formed clusters came to be called micelles, a term borrowed from biology and popularized by G.S. Hartley <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> book Paraffin Chain Salts: A Study in Micelle Formation.|$|E

She played opposite Lars Hanson, a well-known Swedish actor. Stiller became her mentor, training her as a film actress and managing all aspects of her nascent career. She followed her role in Gösta Berling with a starring role in the 1925 German film Die freudlose Gasse (Joyless Street or The Street of Sorrow), directed by G. W.

25|$|The {{belief in}} ghosts as {{souls of the}} {{departed}} is {{closely tied to the}} concept of animism, an ancient belief which attributed souls to everything in nature. As the 19th-century anthropologist George Frazer explained <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>classic</b> work, The Golden Bough (1890), souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body. Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it was widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (ca. (1550 BCE), which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.|$|E
