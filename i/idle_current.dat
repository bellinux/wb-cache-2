50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates <b>idle</b> <b>currents</b> in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|R

Using sensor nodes with included wake-up receivers can prolong the lifetime of the sensor network to several years. However, no gateway exists that can, on the one hand, connect itself to the Internet {{and on the other hand}} can send out the special coded wake-up signal needed by the wake-up receivers on the nodes.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{electrodeposition}} of PdNi films with controllable composition and their suitability as electrical contacts in electronic and spintronic devices based on Silicon and Carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The electrodeposition process and characterisation of the electrical and magnetic {{properties of the}} deposited PdNi films are described. PdNi films with a wide composition range can be deposited from the same bath by changing the deposition potential. Electrical characterisation shows the formation of high quality PdNi-Si Schottky barriers while magnetic measurements prove the ferromagnetic nature of the PdNi films. Electrodeposited PdNi films are thus shown to be suitable contacts for electronic and spintronic devices. Hydrogen sensors comprising back to back electrodeposited PdNi-Si Schottky barriers are fabricated and characterised. The back to back architecture ensures low current operation at all biases. Palladium causes the Hydrogen molecules to dissociate and be absorbed by the film, while Nickel makes the sensor resistant to repeated cycling in the Hydrogen environment. The sensors exhibit extremely low <b>idle</b> <b>currents,</b> large percentage current increases on Hydrogen exposure and high selectivity for Hydrogen. These factors, {{in addition to the}} simplicity of fabrication and easy integration with conventional electronics show that electrodeposited PdNi-Si Schottky barriers are well suited for use as Hydrogen sensors. The workfunction change in PdNi films exposed to Hydrogen is used to characterise CNTs contacted by electrodeposited PdNi. The PdNi contacted CNTs exhibit ohmic characteristics, which change on exposure to Hydrogen. Examining this change allows differentiation between semiconducting and metallic CNTs. Raman spectroscopy is used to characterise the same CNTs and the results are compared with the electrical characterisation in Hydrogen. The electrical and Raman analysis experimentally verify the theoretically assigned CNT Raman features. The fabrication and electrical characterisation of CNT transistors incorporating electrodeposited PdNi contacts are presented. The CNTs are spin coated from a 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene dispersion and contacted with electrodeposited PdNi. The PdNi-Si Schottky barrier is used to suppress the current through the Silicon substrate during electrical characterisation. The operating restrictions imposed by the direct PdNi-Si contact and methods to overcome the same are discussed.

The traffic loads are typically {{so low that}} overall idle duration energy consumption dominates. Low duty cycle MAC protocols are used {{in order to reduce}} the energy consumption in idle periods.

Our solution consists of an external low-cost hardware wake-up circuit attached to the microcontroller of a sensor node. In order to communicate with a sensor node, a special kind of out-of-band modulated wake-up signal is transmitted. The modulated signal contains data that enables one to distinguish between differently addressed nodes in order to avoid undesired node wake-ups. Furthermore, we advocate the idea of combining RTWAC to a MAC protocol running on the normal sensor node radio in order to simultaneously achieve low energy consumption and low latency for reliable data communication. 1 Keywords–Radio triggered wake-ups, low-power, Sensor network MAC protocols, Design and implementation 1...|$|R

In total, five main helium cooling circuits have to be supplied by the refrigerator—four for the magnet including auxiliary equipment like support structure, thermal shield and current leads, {{and one for the}} cryo-pumps. For the shields of the latter, an additional LN₂—cooling circuit is required. The lowest operating temperature is 3. 3 K. It will be provided by evacuating a sub-cooler bath using a cold or warm compressor. Three of the helium cooling circuits use altogether four identical cold circulators. Apart from the current leads which are supplied with the coolant from a LHe storage tank, the peak reserve power required is equal to 7 kW at 4. 5 K entropy equivalent. However, this potential maximal demand occurs continuously for periods of only a few hours at most, and altogether for less than 1 % of annual time.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} communications and upcoming requirements of 5 G networks are driving interest in the areas from wireless transceivers to sensor nodes. One of the most vital components of the wireless transmitter is the radio frequency power amplifier. A large-signal device model of the transistor {{is an essential part}} of the power amplifier design process. Despite the significant developments in large-signal modelling, the models for commercially available devices from the manufacturers are still under continuous development and often lack accuracy. One of the main objectives of this thesis is the validation and extension of an analytic approach as an alternative to conventional large-signal modelling for power amplifier designing. The first contribution is the derivation of new analytical expressions based on the equivalent circuit model, including the extrinsic parasitic elements introduced by the package, to calculate the optimum source and load impedances and to predict the performance of a radio frequency power amplifier. These expressions allow to evaluate the effects of a package on the optimum impedance values and performance. The second contribution is establishing the accuracy of the analytic approach. Harmonic balance simulation is used as the first benchmark to evaluate the method at various bias points and frequencies. The validity of the analytic approach is demonstrated at a frequency of 3. 25 GHz for gallium nitride based high power devices with measurement of prototype radio frequency power amplifier designed for the impedance values obtained from the analytic expressions. The third contribution is extending the analytic approach to determine the optimum impedance values for different criteria of maximum gain, linearity and efficiency. The analytic expressions are utilized to gain an understanding of the relationship among the device performance, the elements of devices and package models and I-V characteristics. The wireless sensor networks are essential elements for the realization of the Internet of Things. Sensor nodes, which are the fundamental building blocks of these networks, have to be energy efficient and able to produce energy to reduce the maintenance cost and to prolong their lifetime. The second main aim of the thesis is designing and implementing an ultra-low power autonomous wireless sensor node that harvests the indoor light energy. The forth contribution of this thesis includes a comprehensive comparison of six different solar cell technologies under a controlled light intensity, carried out to determine the best option for indoor light energy harvesting. The power consumption of the node is reduced by selecting the appropriate hardware and implementing a wake-up receiver to reduce the active and <b>idle</b> mode <b>currents.</b> The low power consumption coupled with light energy harvesting significantly prolong the operating lifetime of the node. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{small amounts}} of either Ir or Ru (up to 22 μg cm− 2) were added to 85 μg cm− 2 Pt by either co-{{sputtering}} or over-layer sputtering onto 3 M Company’s NSTF catalyst support, which was grown on glassy carbon electrodes {{for the purpose of}} simulating fuel cell start-up and shut-down with rotating disk electrode techniques. The transient cathode potentials caused by fuel cell start-up, shut-down and operating conditions were simulated with a combination of potentiostatic and galvanostatic holds. Constant potential was used to simulate fuel cell run, rest and <b>idle,</b> and constant <b>current</b> was used to simulate the start-up and shut-down events. Over the course of an experiment, the catalyst would experience potential as low as 0. 650 VRHE (run) and as high as 1. 53 – 1. 8 VRHE (dependent on the behavior of the composition) under the galvanostatic holds. All compositions including either Ir or Ru lasted significantly longer than for pure Pt under repeated start-up/shut-down. The stability of the over-layer Ir-Pt compositions was significantly higher than for the co-sputtered deposition. The compositions containing 9 and 22 μg cm− 2 Ir over-layer on Pt showed no ORR activity decrease over the course of 1400 SU/SD simulations (2800 potential peaks> 1. 5 VRHE). © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|An {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} ion source working at a microwave frequency of 2. 45 GHz has been developed in order to generate an intense current of singly charged metal ions. It is loaded with metal vapor by an integrated cylindrical sputter magnetron, which was especially designed for this purpose. The MECRIS (Magnetron Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source) merges ECR ion source technology with sputter magnetron technology in a unique manner representing a new metal ion source concept. By using an Al sputter target, {{the efficiency of the}} MECRIS was demonstrated successfully for the example of Al+ ion production. The extractable ion current was measured by a newly developed high-current Faraday cup. On the basis of numerical modeling, the total magnetic field was set {{in a way that the}} permanent magnets of the magnetron and the coils of the ECR source are forming a minimum-B-structure, providing an effective electron trap by the magnetic mirror principle. Simultaneously, optimal electron heating is achieved by a closed ECR-surface at resonant magnetic flux density of 87. 5 mT. Electron temperature increases towards the center of the source to a maximum of about 11 eV and was measured by a double Langmuir probe. Due to the heated electron population, efficient electron impact ionization of the Al atoms is accomplished. Al atoms are injected with a rate of more than 1 E 18 Al-atoms/s resulting in a maximum Al atom density of 2 E 10 1 /cm³. The MECRIS produces mainly singly charged ions of the sputtered material (Al+) and the process gas (Ar+). The Al+ ion extraction current is elevated by one order of magnitude to a maximum of 135 μA by increasing the process parameters sputter magnetron power, microwave power, coil current, and acceleration voltage. Related to the extraction area of about 0. 5 cm², the highest possible Al+ ion current density is 270 μA/cm². A corresponding process parameter dependency was found for the plasma density showing a peak value of about 6 E 11 1 /cm³, which was deduced from probe measurements. The ratio of the extracted Al+ ion current to the Ar+ ion current can be enhanced from 0. 3 to a maximum of 2 by optimization of the process parameters. This was confirmed by probe investigations of the appropriate ion density ratio. In conclusion, the ECR-surface needs to be located in the area of the highest Al atom density in the target plane in order to improve the extraction current and Al+/Ar+ ratio. The MECRIS plasma produces an Al+ ion current, which is up to 140 % higher compared to that of the sole sputter magnetron plasma (without microwave injection). As revealed by probe measurements, this effect is due to the higher plasma density and electron temperature of the MECRIS plasma, leading to a difference of one order of magnitude and 7 eV, respectively. Additionally, the MECRIS plasma has been characterized by optical emission spectroscopy and simulated by a global and a two-dimensional model. Retrieved process parameter dependencies of plasma density, electron temperature, Al+ ion density, and Ar+ ion density coincide with probe findings. Although a discrepancy of the absolute values of partly up to two orders of magnitude is evident. Potentially, the Al+ ion current can be enhanced to the mA-region by optimizing the ion extraction system for minimal <b>idle</b> electrode <b>currents</b> and by rising sputter magnetron power as well as acceleration voltage above the actual limits of 10 kW and 30 kV, respectively...|$|R
