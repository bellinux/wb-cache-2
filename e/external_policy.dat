In early 1896, he attacked Sturdza for his <b>external</b> <b>policy,</b> creating a scandal about the selective sponsoring of Aromanian schools throughout the Balkans. In his anti-Sturdza campaign, Fleva approached the country's breakaway socialist clubs. Some socialists did join his faction, but others condemned him for not supporting the immediate adoption of universal suffrage.|$|E

With senior conspirators forced into retirement, Dimitrijević was the de facto leader of the conspirators.

25|$|The Romanian {{communist}} regime, {{installed in}} 1948, simply dismissed Carp {{and all his}} generation as unfrequentable reactionaries, and viewed all sides of World War I as imperialistic. The Carp family was evicted from Țibănești (nationalized in 1949), and some members were forced into internal exile. Beginning in the 1960s, national communism officially adopted a thinly revised version of Kirițescu's stance, viewing Germanophila {{with a mixture of}} condemnation and embarrassment. Some new paths to interpreting Carp's policies were only made available after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Even then, Lucian Boia notes, historians tended to minimize or simply omit references to Carp's support for the Central Powers, which, to them, still contradicts standard patriotism. In tandem with its reevaluation by other scholars, Carp's historical role has been repeatedly invoked by conservative individuals, think tanks and political groups in post-revolutionary Romania. Others additionally assert that Romania's European integration, effected by 2007, implicitly confirmed, re-contextualized and avenged Carp's <b>external</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common <b>external</b> <b>policy,</b> their internal administrations still being separated.|$|E

During the incidents, Fleva reunited with his old friend Alexandru Macedonski, by then a maverick conservative; his articles in support of Ghenadie were published by Macedonski's political-literary review Liga Ortodoxă.

2500|$|The First Bulgarian Empire was a {{hereditary}} monarchy. The monarch {{was responsible}} for the issues of peace and war. He was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, a judge and a high priest in the pagan period. He guided the <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> of the country and could conclude treaties personally or through authorised emissaries. In the pagan period the title of the ruler was Khan. After 864 Boris I adopted the Slavic Knyaz (Prince), and since 913 the Bulgarian monarchs were recognised as Tsars (Emperors). The authority of the Khan was limited by the leading noble families and the People's Council.

A People's Council in 766 dethroned Khan Sabin because he was seeking peace with the Byzantines.

In that case he assured them that each country should possess a representative in the Imperial Folk Mote on the same terms as the several wards of Andorra itself, and that the settlement of local affairs should be left unreservedly to the minor legislatures, while the Chancellor of the Empire in person would manage the military and naval forces and the general executive department of the whole Confederation. As the four Powers refused to take any notice of Don Pedro's manifesto, the Chancellor declared to the Folk Mote his determination of treating them as recalcitrant rebels, and reducing them by force of arms.
