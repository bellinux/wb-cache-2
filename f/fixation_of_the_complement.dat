40|$|Experiments {{using the}} {{selective}} divalent cation chelator, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) {{showed that the}} alternate complement pathway {{was involved in the}} bactericidal action of bovine serum on two strains of E. coli. The bactericidal system was shown, in experiments involving EGTA and epsilon-amino caproic acid, to be independent of Ca++ and the C 1 unit of complement. The <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complement</b> components C 3 -C 9 by endotoxin does not require a functional classical pathway ((C 1, C 4 and C 2). In the case of one coliform strain (W 1) however, there was an almost total dependence on a factor absorbable at 0 degrees with homologous bacteria, and which appeared to be a natural antibody. These results suggest that in certain circumstances in the cow, gamma globulins may be directly involved in the activation of the alternate complement pathway...|$|E

The pathophysiological occurrence and relevance of catalytic antibodies remains a debated issue. Through the description of the hydrolysis of coagulation factor VIII as model target antigen, we propose that catalytic antibodies directed to the coagulation factor VIII may play a beneficial or a deleterious role depending on the immuno-inflammatory condition under which they occur...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{classical pathway}} <b>of</b> human complement by house-dust extracts and its relevance to atopic disease was studied. Our results confirm {{that for most}} sera of adults, house-dust extract is, on a weight basis, a more potent C-activator than aggregated human IgG or lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Naturally occurring IgM antibodies directed against ubiquitous polysaccharides {{appeared to be the}} dominant factor in the C 1 activation by house-dust extracts in human sera. Large variations were found between sera with respect to <b>the</b> concns <b>of</b> these IgM antibodies as measured by C 1 activation or <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> haemolytic <b>complement.</b> <b>The</b> IgM antibody titre was, however, not associated with atopic disease. Consequently, we do not support the hypothesis put forward by Berrens et al. (1978) (Allergol.

More than 90 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-activating potential <b>of</b> allergen extracts like house dust was found in the fractions with high mol. wt material (mol. wt greater than 100 K).

40|$|It {{was shown}} in a {{previous}} communication (1) that following <b>the</b> intraparotid inoculation <b>of</b> monkeys (M. mulatta) with <b>the</b> virus <b>of</b> mumps, an antigen is produced in the gland which reacts with an antibody in <b>the</b> serum <b>of</b> monkeys convalescent from the infection to bring about <b>the</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complement.</b> <b>The</b> antibody was not found in normal animals. These observations led us to determine whether mumps in the human being {{gave rise to a}} similar antibody during convalescence. In the present report <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> tests in mumps are summarized.

40|$|An immunohistologic {{complement}} fixation test {{has been used in}} an effort to detect immune complexes in sections of kidney from rats injected with rabbit anti-rat kidney serum and in sections of biopsied kidneys from four humans with membranous glomerulonephritis. Sections of the rat and human kidneys were treated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit globulin or antihuman globulin respectively. Adjacent sections in each case were incubated first with fresh guinea pig serum and then in a second step were treated with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies against fixed guinea pig complement to detect sites of <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complement.</b> It was demonstrated that the sites of rabbit globulin in glomerular capillary walls of the rat kidneys and the sites of localized human globulin in thickened glomerular capillary walls and swollen glomerular endothelial cells of the human kidneys were the same sites in which guinea pig complement was fixed in vitro. It was concluded from these studies that rabbit nephrotoxic antibodies localize in rat glomeruli in complement-fixing antigen-antibody complexes. Furthermore, it was concluded that the deposits of human globulin in the glomeruli of the human kidneys behaved like antibody globulin in complement-fixing antigen-antibody complexes. The significance of demonstrating complement-fixing immune complexes in certain diseased tissues is discussed in regard to determination of the causative role of allergic reactions in disease...|$|E
40|$|From the {{experiments}} reported {{here it is}} evident that the amount of each complement component which combines with specific immune aggregates depends upon a number of factors, including the age of the complement; the concentrations of antigen, antibody, and complement; hydrogen ion and electrolyte concentrations; and time and temperature of incubation for fixation. The experiments also reveal the following: 1. C' 4 must be considered a combining component of complement because it is invariably inactivated or adsorbed by specific aggregates. 2. C' 3, although necessary for the final action of complement, e. g., hemolysis or bactericidal action, is fixed only partially or not at all by antigen-antibody compounds. 3. C' 2 is fixed together with C' 4, as is evident from those experiments in which reactivations were conducted with a CO 2 -insoluble fraction which contained no C' 4 activity. 4. Mid-piece, which contains C' 1, generally stated to be the single combining component of complement, is adsorbed by immune aggregates in varying amounts depending on the experimental conditions employed. 5. No inactivation or adsorption of C' 4 and of C' 3 occurs upon the addition to specific aggregates of serum which has been heated at 56 °C. for 30 to 50 minutes. This indicates that certain thermolabile constituents of serum are necessary for the fixation of C' 4. Inactivation of C' 4 by hydrazine or the removal of C' 3 by the insoluble carbohydrate from yeast does not markedly influence the fixation of the other components. 6. The assumption that the mid-piece is the single combining component of complement is further questioned for the following reasons. First, C' 4 in fresh, untreated serum combines with specific aggregates, but C' 4 in heat-inactivated serum does not. It is, therefore, apparent that a part of the combining complement must be attributed to C' 4 and its carrier C' 2. Second, it will be shown in a subsequent paper that C' 1, heated at 56 °C. for 45 minutes, combines with specific immune complexes, and in doing so may in fact inhibit the further combination of the components of untreated complement. This effect, first noted by Ehrlich and Sachs (27), is termed a "complementoid" action. Thirdly, it will also be shown on the basis of quantitative nitrogen data (28), that the combining nitrogen, in those instances in which large amounts of serum are added to a constant amount of aggregate, should for the most part be attributed to C' 4 and its carrier C' 2. 7. The nature and the molecular size of the antigen does not influence the qualitative picture of <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complement</b> components. 8. While it is tempting to speculate on the mechanism of complement fixation, it probably is advisable that such speculation be postponed until experiments similar to those reported here are performed with purified components. However, certain differences between the <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complement</b> components to specific aggregates and the adsorption of these components to non-specific agents, are apparent. For example, in specific immune fixation C' 4, C' 2, and varying amounts of C' 1 are fixed, while in non-specific adsorption both to inorganic adsorbents (29) and to untreated bacteria (30, 31), no fixation of C' 4 –C' 2 occurs while all of the other components of complement are adsorbed. Furthermore, C' 3 is bound only partially or not at all to specific aggregates, while it is completely adsorbed or inactivated by non-specific adsorbents. It appears, therefore, that the highly reactive component, C' 4, is directly and immediately involved in specific immune fixation. 9. A very small amount of specific immune aggregate combines with a large amount of complement; whereas a large amount of non-specific agent adsorbs only a small amount of complement. This difference is undoubtedly due to the marked chemical affinity of C' 4 –C' 2 and C' 1 for the surfaces presented by immune aggregates. 10. It can be now stated that when complement exerts its activity in hemolytic, bacteriolytic, or bactericidal reactions, C' 4 –C' 2 and varying amounts of C' 1 must first combine (fix) with the antigen-antibody compound in question; and that any secondary manifestation is dependent both on the adjunctive action of the unbound C' 3 (26) and {{on the nature of the}} substrate employed. The chemical and immunological implications of these results will be further elaborated in subsequent papers...|$|E
40|$|Although <b>the</b> {{activity}} <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> is {{exhibited in}} bactericidal, bacteriolytic, and hemolytic phenomena, <b>the</b> hemolysis <b>of</b> sensitized {{red blood cells}} is the most clearly defined property. Nevertheless, the r 61 e <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various components <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> in immune hemolysis has not been determined under the most favorable conditions. Liefmann and Cohn (1) assert that <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> in immune hemolysis is due to <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> hemolysis rather than to an initial <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complement.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary, Eagle (2, 3) and Ponder (4) state that complement must first be bound by sensitized erythroeytes before hemolysis occurs. These authors {{made no attempt to}} identify the components operating in this fixation. Many investigators (5 - 8) have claimed that the mid-piece is fixed by sensitized red blood cells. Brin (9) states, however, that the end-piece alone is bound by immune aggregates. Still others hold that both end-piece and mid-piece combine (10 - 12). It has also been asserted that the fourth component is involved in <b>the</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> prior to hemolysis (13 - 15). Furthermore, Nathan (16) concludes that <b>the</b> third component <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> is not fixed by sensitized sheep red blood cells. Pillemer, Seifter, and Ecker (17) have shown that Ct 4, C~ 2, and varying amounts of Ctl 1 are always fixed by antigen-rabbit antibody aggregates. In agreement with Nathan, these authors showed that Cr 3 is not fixed by sensitized red blood cells. <b>Fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>complement</b> in <b>the</b> work last mentioned was determined by measuring the residual component activity in fresh guinea pig serum after fixation. This, however, did not disclose whether the adsorbed components were functionally active, since under the experimental conditions employed no visible changes occurred which could be attributed to <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> combining <b>complement</b> components.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an inflammatory}} demyelinating autoimmune disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{central nervous system}} triggered by the body’s own immune system reacting against self-antigens. Autoreactive B and T lymphocytes as well as activated macrophages and <b>the</b> bodies <b>complement</b> system contribute to, and maintain the inflammatory lesions in brain and spinal cord. For over 20 years, especially autoreactive T lymphocytes attracted major attention due to their predominant presence in acute inflammatory lesions, their potential to transfer an autoimmune disease from one organism to another (EAE mouse model) and the link between specific MHC class II alleles and specific autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes mellitus. Presently antibody-secreting B lymphocytes {{get more and more}} in <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> autoimmune diseases researchers because of recent strong evidence of their central role in the induction and maintenance of inflammatory reactions. Their main pathologic potential is based on <b>the</b> secretion <b>of</b> autoreactive antibodies that are able to bind and opsonize autoantigens, followed by stimulation <b>of</b> macrophages and <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body’s <b>complement</b> system. Moreover, autoreactive B cells can strongly enhance the T cell response by presenting processed autoantigens in combination with MHC molecules on their surface. In this thesis, novel autoantigen-specific fusion proteins for the targeting and elimination on one hand and <b>the</b> staining <b>of</b> autoreactive B cell populations on the other hand were successfully generated. The membrane-bound B cell receptors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target cell populations and their specificity to a unique antigen will serve as target for the recombinant fusion proteins. For staining purposes, <b>the</b> extracellular domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was genetically fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The protein was characterized by western blotting and ELISA using <b>the</b> supernatant <b>of</b> MOG-specific 8. 18 -C 5 hybridoma cells. In flow cytometry, the eGFP-MOG fusion protein specifically stained the above mentioned 8. 18 -C 5 cells and isolated splenocytes from transgenic IgHMOG mice via their surface B-cell receptors. For the targeting and specific elimination of autoreactive B cell populations, the autoantigens MOG and PLP (proteolipid protein) were recombinantly fused to <b>the</b> truncated form <b>of</b> Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA’). As a negative control for subsequent toxicity assays, both proteins were cloned without toxic moiety. The so-called ‘autoimmunotoxins’ MOG-ETA’ and PLP-ETA’, as well as their counterparts without toxin MOG and PLP, were efficiently expressed in bacteria. After their purification via IMAC and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), they all showed a high purity as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent western blotting using their antigen-specific hybridoma cell supernatants 8. 18 -C 5 (anti-MOG) and F 4 - 2 D 2 (anti-PLP). The binding analyses in western blot, ELISA and further on in flow cytometry analyses was successful revealing a high specificity of all expressed proteins. <b>The</b> binding <b>of</b> MOG-ETA’ and MOG to isolated splenocytes from IgHMOG mice was additionally verified by FACS analysis. MOG-ETA’ and PLP-ETA’ were used for XTT viability assays and demonstrated a highly specific, either strong (MOG-ETA’) or moderate (PLP-ETA’) toxicity on their specific target hybridoma cell line. As the expressed autoantigens without toxin moiety revealed no toxicity upon incubation with the target cell line, <b>the</b> toxic effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autoimmunotoxins can attributed to functional release <b>of</b> ETA’ into <b>the</b> cytosol, followed by inhibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein synthesis and <b>the</b> apoptosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell. Subsequent toxicity analyses were carried out using isolated splenocytes from transgenic IgHMOG mice. MOG-ETA’ was incubated with MOG-reactive splenocytes in different protein concentrations and its depleting effect could be clearly confirmed by quantitative FACS analyses. Successive animal experiments were carried out using two different mouse models. First <b>the</b> toxic effect <b>of</b> MOG-ETA’ was investigated in transgenic IgHMOG mice. The daily intravenous application of MOG-ETA’ administered over a time period of 5 days was able to specifically reduce <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> MOG-reactive B lymphocytes to approximately 50 % in comparison to control animals. As the transgenic IgHMOG mice are not <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> choice because they are characterized by high titers of MOG-reactive antibodies which are able to intercept applied immunotoxin, the targeting and depletion of MOG-reactive B lymphocytes turned out to be too challenging in this model. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> a MOG-induced EAE model in DBA/ 1 mice for in vivo evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MOG-ETA’ autoimmunotoxin better represents <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflammatory reaction to be found in multiple sclerosis lesions. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MOG-ETA’ autoimmunotoxin had a positive therapeutic effect on EAE-induced animals as the disease development was almost completely prevented in the treated group. The control group was injected with an immunotoxin that was comprised of a non-relevant binding ligand but the same toxic moiety as in the autoimmunotoxin MOG-ETA’. As these animals revealed a severe clinical course of 10 days after EAE induction, the specific in vivo mode <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MOG-ETA’ autoimmunotoxin was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the present work provides the proof-of-principle for a novel approach that may have a strong positive impact on antigen-specific therapies in autoimmune disorders...|$|R

40|$|Forty-five {{women were}} treated with a sacrospinous {{ligament}} <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vaginal apex between 1979 and 1993.

In both of our cases, we fixed the femoral shaft fracture with a plate and screw, and followed this with closed reduction and internal <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femoral neck fracture. However, in one case (case 1), reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtrochanteric fracture was lost due to proximal screw back-out resulting from inadequate <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal fragment, which in turn led to a 10 ° varus deformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal femur.
