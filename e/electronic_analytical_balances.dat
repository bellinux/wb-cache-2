40|$|Abstract. The {{excellent}} {{properties of}} Mg-Li alloys make them suitable light fabrication materials used extensively in many applications. The microstructure {{and the surface}} oxide film at different temperature of as-cast Mg- 7 Li alloy were investigated by optical microscope(OM), scanning electron microscopy(SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD) and <b>electronic</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>balance.</b> Results showed that Mg- 7 Li alloy was composed of mainly α phase and β phase. With increasing temperature, the morphology of the alloy surface varied from {{the formation of a}} very thin oxide film, large amounts of oxide particles to the thick and coarse film with a mass of cellular protuberances in size of 40 - 80 µm. The ratio of oxidation weight gains rose from 0. 08 % to 11. 58 %. The surface oxide film consisted of mainly magnesium oxide(MgO) phase and lithium peroxide(Li 2 O 2) phase, resulting from the reaction of oxygen with Mg and Li. The volume of the oxides on β phase greater than that on α phase {{led to the formation of}} cellular protuberance on the surface of Mg- 7 Li alloy at high temperature...|$|R
40|$|Presented {{here is a}} slotted-quad-beam {{structure}} sensor for {{the measurement}} of friction in micro bearings. Stress concentration slots are incorporated into a conventional quad-beam structure to improve the sensitivity of force measurements. The performance comparison between the quad-beam structure sensor and the slotted-quad-beam structure sensor are performed by theoretical modeling and finite element (FE) analysis. A hollow stainless steel probe {{is attached to the}} mesa of the sensor chip by a tailor-made organic glass fixture. Concerning the overload protection of the fragile beams, a glass wafer is bonded onto the bottom of sensor chip to limit the displacement of the mesa. The calibration of the packaged device is experimentally performed by a tri-dimensional positioning stage, a precision piezoelectric ceramic and an <b>electronic</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>balance,</b> which indicates its favorable sensitivity and overload protection. To verify the potential of the proposed sensor being applied in micro friction measurement, a measurement platform is established. The output of the sensor reflects the friction of bearing resulting from dry friction and solid lubrication. The results accord with the theoretical modeling and demonstrate that the sensor has the potential application in measuring the micro friction force under stable stage in MEMS machines...|$|R
