50|$|Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari), {{also known}} as the <b>indigo</b> <b>macaw,</b> is a large all-blue Brazilian parrot, a member of a large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. It was first {{described}} by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1856. Lear's macaw is 70 - 75 cm long and weighs around 950 g. It is metallic blue with a faint, often barely visible, tinge of green, and a yellow patch of skin {{at the base of the}} heavy, black bill.|$|E
50|$|Anodorhynchus is a genus {{of large}} blue macaws from open and semi-open {{habitats}} {{in central and}} eastern South America. It includes two endangered species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear's macaw also known as the <b>indigo</b> <b>macaw,</b> and one probably extinct species, the glaucous macaw. At about 100 cm in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear's macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth macaws are mostly tree nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably Acrocomia aculeata, Attalea phalerata, Butia yatay and Syagrus coronata).|$|E
40|$|The {{case of the}} Indigo, or Lear's Macaw, Anodorhynchus leari, {{is unique}} in South American ornithology. The species, {{although}} described more than 100 years ago, was known only through very few living specimens, which entered occasionally the bird trade, without any indication of their origins. It was presumed "probably some part of Brazil" (Salvadori, 1891). The last speculation {{was that it was}} unlikely, though not impossible, that the <b>Indigo</b> <b>Macaw</b> might not be an independem species, but rather, a hybrid between the two other well known blue macaws, Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus and A. glaucus (Voous, 1965) ...|$|E
