40|$|New {{techniques}} in cross-layer wireless networks are building demand for ubiquitous channel sounding, that is, {{the capability to}} measure channel impulse response (CIR) with any standard wireless network and node. Towards that goal, we present a software-defined IEEE 802. 11 b receiver and CIR estimation system with little additional computational complexity compared to 802. 11 b reception alone. The system implementation, using the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio, is described and compared to previous work. By overcoming computational limitations and performing direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS-SS) matched filtering on the USRP, we enable high-quality yet inexpensive CIR estimation. We validate the channel sounder and present a drive test campaign which measures hundreds of channels between WiFi access points and an <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>receiver</b> in urban and suburban areas...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results from}} several meetings of three different focus groups. The meetings were conducted {{as a part of}} the evaluation for the Pilot Study of Advisory On-Board Vehicle Warning Systems at Railroad Grade Crossings. The focus groups were used to obtain in-depth information about driver-perception, driver-system-interaction, and other related issues. The three focus groups were drivers, operation managers, and members of the Project Management Committee (PMC) /Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). This Pilot Study used commercially available equipment that did not meet the system reliability standards promised by the contracting team and required for this particular application. False alerts ruined the trust of the drivers and the project team for the <b>In-Vehicle</b> <b>Receiver</b> (IVR) system. The driver's interest was reduced due to repeated false alerts, the long development period before deployment, and annoying noise when the IVR was activated (beeping). A lot of drivers did not report the fals...|$|E

50|$|EchoStar Mobile {{was set up}} in 2008 as Solaris Mobile, a {{joint venture}} company between SES and Eutelsat Communications to develop and commercialize the first {{geostationary}} satellite systems in Europe for broadcasting video, radio and data to <b>in-vehicle</b> <b>receivers</b> and to mobile devices, such as mobile phones, portable media players and PDAs. In January 2014 all stock in Solaris Mobile was acquired by EchoStar Corporation and in March 2015 the company was renamed EchoStar Mobile.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to collect real world travel route data using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and to develop the models needed to use these data in route choice and other travel behavior research. To achieve the goal three specific analyses are conducted. First, a GIS model was developed to divide the data stream recorded by the <b>in-vehicle</b> GPS <b>receivers</b> into individual trips with the start and end point of the trip being specifically identified. Second, a spatial model was developed to change the typology of the routes (or trips) from representation as a series of points into a series of continuous network links. Automating this data processing will allow analysis of larger datasets for more generalizable results. Third, travel time on each road link in the entire network was estimated using the sparse sample of GPS travel data (256 vehicles each for 10 days spreading over the 18 month study period) as travel time probes. This model is necessary so that the link travel times on each alternative routes faced by the drivers for each trip are known by researchers. This knowledge of the full network travel times, which has not been available in any previous research, will allow for the generation of alternative routes and comparison with the chosen routes to determine the relative influences of different factors on route choice. ^ One specific unique aspect of this work is that data for calibration and evaluation of models were available. The evaluations of the models indicated which combination of parameters was best. The trip dividing model correctly identified 94 % of the trips. The accuracy level of the point-to-link data conversion model was 95 %. The average difference between the GPS recorded travel time and the estimated travel time for a trip is 70. 8 seconds for the 12, 767 trips (average trip length 5, 226 meters). Overall, this research provides the first highly reliable and fully evaluated series of GIS models to automatically process GPS collected travel route data. The results will increase the confidence and reliability of GPS usage for route choice research and other transportation planning exercises. ...|$|R
