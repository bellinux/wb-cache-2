500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E

2500|$|Bill Lidderdale, a {{district}} {{executive in the}} Monterey Bay Area Council during the 1960s, was the Esselen Lodge staff adviser for several years. Former Chief Scout Executive Robert Mazzuca, an alumnus of Troop 428 in San Juan Bautista, [...] credited Lidderdale as the reason he became a Scout executive. [...] "I just worshiped this guy. He was my hero. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> professional Scouting and said he thought I would do a good job." [...] Mazzuca later achieved the Brotherhood Honor {{as a member of}} Esselen Lodge during the 1960s and served on Pico Blanco camp staff for two summers. The Lodge observed its 50th anniversary at Pico Blanco camp from August 17–19, 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "He 'ad a {{nice little}} cottage, <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about,</b> near Hull, and 'is wife's father, a man of pretty near seventy, lived with 'em. Well-off the old man was, and, as she was his only daughter, they looked to 'ave all his money when he'd gorn. Their only fear was that 'e might marry agin, and, judging from wot 'e used to tell <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the old man, I thought it more than likely.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{properly}} understood," [...] said Isbister, [...] "what it {{was brought}} this on. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> overstudy. I've often been curious." ...|$|R
6000|$|You may {{remember}} a story <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> some anonymous friend. [...] "His latest," [...] said he now, [...] "is to send David a rocking-horse!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the massacre, when {{five hundred}} Poles {{were shot down}} by Cossacks in the market-place, merely because they sung their {{national}} hymn.|$|E
6000|$|... "But as you say, it is said. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it, {{not long}} afterwards, and I {{do not think}} he would have dared had there been anything--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack. That is, he {{has told}} me about a good many things. Of course I don't suppose <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> some of the tricks they played." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you have lost many things--last night, for instance, you lost Tommy, and when he slept with <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> much <b>about</b> you and--others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has made}} me most miserable," [...] she said. [...] "I thought I {{could not have been}} more miserable than I was before <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jim, thoughtfully. [...] "I've {{never left}} Canada, {{but a man}} I knew {{used to talk about}} Langrigg. I expect <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> these things; he is dead now." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} he had never really left San Gaudenzio. I asked him, 'Used you to think of it, the lake, the Monte Baldo, the laurel trees down the slope?' He tried to see what I wanted to know. Yes, he said--but uncertainly. I {{could see that he}} had never been really homesick. It had been very wretched on the ship going from Havre to New York. That <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about.</b> And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the gold-mines, the galleries, the valley, the huts in the valley. But he had never really fretted for San Gaudenzio whilst he was in California.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill {{are to be}} married, {{and that}} they have been privately engaged to one another this long while. How very odd!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that, too. They {{were going}} to swindle some folks, and Abe heard about it and gave the thing away. Abe won't stand for {{anything}} that ain't strictly honest." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{he was not}} discouraged. He practised {{every day}} except Sundays, and indeed {{he was the only}} person in the club who practised at night. When <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> this, I was a little surprised.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{understood}} that I was on his side in this question, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> a good sheep-dog he once possessed which {{he had to get}} rid of because he would not take a hare! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly he {{believed}} it. He was most kind and sympathetic. We {{had a nice}} chat. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> himself. <b>He</b> used {{to be very good}} at football. He doesn't play now, but he often thinks of the past.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Capadose {{appeared}} not {{to perceive}} {{it or not}} to heed it if she did. 'There was a person, not far from your door, whom Clement called my attention to. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> her but we were going the other way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only heard}} it {{yesterday}} evening, Mrs. Cunningham; after that {{shot through the}} window my father thought I ought to know all about it, for the attempt might be repeated more successfully. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> her, and about the treasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{paid them}} well," [...] he answered. [...] "At least I didn't do it myself. My servant comes from these parts, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{the place and}} {{arranged}} everything. I am hoping {{to be able to}} buy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{painting}} a sweet one now," [...] Elma put in quickly, [...] "down here, close by, in Chetwood Forest. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it; {{it must be}} simply lovely--all fern and mosses, with, oh! such a beautiful big snake in the foreground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess Davis didn't {{lay it on}} any {{too thick}} when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> you. Now see here, you'll begin {{the day with a}} regular course of training, working until nine o'clock, after which time you'll get down to a boy's business, see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] she said, and laughed, {{a little}} too carelessly. [...] "You see a beau for me in every bush, Ellen. Why <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> his wife to-night--how much she was to him--how empty her death had left the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw a nold gent, Uncle--perfect gentleman. And <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it. Mos' respectable 'e was.

6000|$|... "That's it. I didn't {{know it at}} the time, {{because he}} went {{to another part of the}} barn where I couldn't see him. But later on, when he brought the uniform back, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it. <b>He</b> thought he had been wonderfully slick." ...|$|R
