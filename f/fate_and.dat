5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk.

The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

Estimates for that period place {{the total population of}} Bukovinan and Transylvanian Romanians in such facilities, throughout Russia, at 120,000 or 130,000. Meanwhile, in Romania itself there were several thousand Romanian refugees from Austria-Hungary who immediately signed up for service in the Romanian Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|Ifs origins can {{be traced}} to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two {{magazines}} while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: <b>Fate</b> <b>and</b> Other Worlds. Fate published articles about occult and supernatural events, while Other Worlds was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled Strange; the other was If.|$|E

5|$|After Mercyful Fate {{broke up}} in 1985, King Diamond, along with Michael Denner and Timi Hansen, formed the eponymous King Diamond band.

They were {{replaced}} by Mike Moon and Hal Patino, respectively, and King Diamond continued releasing albums even after Mercyful Fate had reformed. After leaving King Diamond, Michael Denner opened up a recordshop in Copenhagen, until 1988, when he formed the band Lavina (which would later become Zoser Mez), along with former bandmate Hank Shermann. Hank Shermann had formed the hard rock band Fate in 1985, after having left Mercyful Fate. With Fate, Shermann released two albums: 1985's <b>Fate</b> <b>and</b> 1986's A Matter of Attitude. After leaving the band, Shermann joined-up with Michael Denner to form Lavina.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her <b>fate,</b> <b>and</b> offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
