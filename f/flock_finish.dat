50|$|Tim <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> 5th in NASCAR’s inaugural Strictly Stock race at Charlotte, North Carolina in 1949. NASCAR's first {{official}} season ended with Tim in eighth, Tim's brother Fonty Flock in fifth, {{and his other}} brother Bob Flock in third in the overall points standing. Tim sat out the 1950 NASCAR season recovering from a four car pile up at Charlotte.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of flocking done worldwide uses finely cut natural or synthetic fibers. A <b>flocked</b> <b>finish</b> imparts a decorative and/or functional characteristic to the surface. The {{variety of materials}} that are applied to numerous surfaces through different flocking methods create {{a wide range of}} end products. The flocking process is used on items ranging from retail consumer goods to products with high technology military applications.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was leading}} {{by more than}} a minute at the 1953 Daytona Beach Road Course race, but ran out of gas taking the white flag {{at the start of the}} final lap. Flock's {{teammate}} pushed his car into the pits. Bill Blair passed to win the race in a 1953 Oldsmobile. <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> second by 26 seconds. He had four wins, 17 Top-10 finishes, and three poles to finish fourth in the final points.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Speedweeks" [...] {{weekend is}} {{expanded}} to three events, the [...] Sportsmen race, the [...] Modified race, and the [...] main event. Dick Joslin and Cotton Owens win the preliminaries, respectively. Tim <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> {{the main event}} first, but was disqualified on a minor technicality. Second place finisher Lee Petty edged out Buck Baker, and Petty was declared {{the winner of the}} [...] contest. Flock became the first driver to have radio contact with his crew.|$|R
2500|$|Polesitter Bob Pronger [...] {{and second}} place starter Fonty Flock had a bet {{as to who}} would lead the first lap. They both raced wildly into the north corner. Pronger went too fast into corner, and wrecked his car. Flock had over a one-minute lead in the race, but {{ran out of gas}} taking the white flag {{at the start of the}} final lap. Flock’s {{teammate}} pushed his car into the pits. Bill Blair passed to win the race in a 1953 Oldsmobile. <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> second by 26seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The forty-first {{and last}} {{race of the}} 1951 season was held on November 25 at the [...]750 mile dirt New Mobile Speedway. Frank Mundy won the pole. Herb Thomas {{finished}} 21st and went home as 1951 NASCAR Grand National Champion. Fonty and Tim <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> fourth and second respectively to eventually finish second and third in the Championship, and their brother Bob Flock got in a massive accident and broke his neck when the roof collapsed. Frank Mundy's win at New Mobile propelled him to fifth in the final standings, while Lee Petty, winner of just one race at the Monroe County Fairgrounds, finished 16th {{in the race to}} claim fourth in the standings.|$|R
5000|$|The Wilkes 200 in 1952 {{turned into}} a battle between {{brothers}}. Two sets of brothers competed in the race, and they took the top four spots at the <b>finish.</b> The <b>Flock</b> Brothers (Fonty Flock and Tim Flock) were strong, but the Thomas brothers (Herb Thomas and Donald Thomas) had the better outcome. Herb Thomas, driving his 1952 [...] "Fabulous" [...] Hudson Hornet, won the pole, led 192 of the 200 laps, and grabbed the victory. Fonty Flock led the first eight laps and finished the race second. Donald Thomas, also in a 1952 [...] "Fabulous" [...] Hudson Hornet, finished third, and Tim <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> fourth. Eleven of the 27 cars entered in the race finished. Six of the top nine positions were driving Hudson Hornets.|$|R
5000|$|Turner {{continued}} to race under other sanctioning bodies, including the Midwest Association for Race Cars (MARC), even promoting his own 100-mile event {{on the dirt}} at Lakewood Speedway, Georgia, in October 1961. Tim <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> second in that event. Turner and Flock sued NASCAR and its president Bill France [...] "seeking $200,000 punitive damages each and restitution for loss of earnings." [...] "Attorneys for the drivers claim the ban represents a violation of state right to work laws because test driving contracts involving $150 a day plus expenses were canceled {{as a result of}} the action. NASCAR and France's attorneys contended the ban isn't a right to work violation because it doesn't involve an employer-employee relationship. They said Flock and Turner are individual contractors and not employees of NASCAR or any track." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1966 Barris {{was asked}} to design a theme car for the Batman {{television}} series. Originally the auto stylist Dean Jeffries was contracted to build the car for the show in late 1965, but when the studio wanted the car faster than he could deliver, the project was given to Barris. With the short notice, Barris thought the Futura might work well, and using Jeffriess initial car, decided that its unusual winged shape would be an ideal {{starting point for the}} Batmobile. Barris hired Bill Cushenberry to modify the cars metalwork.Barris went on to build three fiberglass replicas using the frames and running gear from 1966 Ford Galaxie cars for the show circuit, three of which were covered with a felt-like <b>flocking</b> <b>finish</b> in the 1970s. Barris later acquired a fourth replica, a metal car built on a 1958 Thunderbird.|$|R
40|$|A profit {{maximization}} model and an ARIMA model {{were developed to}} forecast water demand for broiler production. Broiler production decisions are made in three successive stages [...] primary broiler breeding flock, hatchery <b>flock,</b> and <b>finishing</b> broiler production. The forecasted numbers of broilers from structural and ARIMA models depart significantly from a USGS physical model. Analysis indicates 15 % slippage in water demand forecasting related to disregarding the role of economic variables. We also found that an appropriate lag structure can fully capture the information used in structural models, assuming no structural change. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Flocking {{involves}} {{the application of}} fine particles to adhesive coated surfaces. The majority of flocking is done using finely cut natural or synthetic fibers. <b>Flocked</b> <b>finishes</b> impart a decorative and/or required characteristics to functional surfaces such as fabrics, plastic films and sheet metals. Flock fibers are usually applied to adhesive coated surfaces mechanically, electrostatically, or {{by a combination of}} both techniques. The focal points of this year investigation are: (1) experimental verification of a mathematical model for flock fiber motion in an electric field and (2) objective color measurement of loose flock fibers and flocked surfaces. Flock motion in an DC flocking zone was investigated using a high speed digital CCD camera and an image analysis software package. The experimental evidences show that flock motion is influenced by the net charge on a flock fiber, relative humidity conditioning of flock fibers, and applied electric field strength. A color measurement protocol for loose flock fiber was also developed. PROJECT OBJECTIVE 1. Develop a fundamental understanding of flock motion in electrostatic, gravitational and pneumatic force field during the flocking process. 2. Establish an understanding of textile based flock materials and processes from the standpoint of test procedures as they pertain to materials processing properties such as electrical conductivity, fiber motion. 3. Develop a fundamental understanding of some of the functional properties of flocked materials such as surface durability, coloration and color measurement. 4. Understand fundamentals of controlling transport phenomena through flocked surfaces and assemblies...|$|R
50|$|The top ten {{finishers}} were: Speedy Thompson (defeating Flock by two laps), Fonty <b>Flock,</b> Ray Duhigg (<b>finished</b> {{in a car}} {{owned by}} Julian Petty), Bob Welborn, Lee Petty (father of Richard Petty who started his NASCAR career six years later), Buck Baker, Bill Blair, Joe Eubanks, Jimmie Lewallen, and Bub King. Ralph Dutton was the last-place finisher of the race.|$|R
40|$|Free {{range and}} organic systems expose the laying hen more to {{unexpected}} events and adverse climatic conditions than barn and cage systems. In France, The Netherlands and Switzerland {{the requirements for}} a hen suitable to produce in free range and organic systems were discussed with farmers. The farmers preferred for these systems a more ‘robust’ hen, more specifically defined as a heavier hen with good eating capacity. Benchmarking of flocks in a web-based management program in The Netherlands from layer <b>flocks</b> <b>finished</b> in 2008 – 2013 indicated that in earlier years indeed mortality among organic {{and to a lesser}} extent free range hens was higher than among barn or cage hens. Feed conversion (kg feed/kg eggs) is higher, but the gap is closing. Improvements in management of the hens during rearing and in the layer phase in free range and organic systems seem to be important. Breeding companies take behaviour and performance in non-cage systems into account in their selection programs. Heavier hens need a diet with a lower protein to energy ratio. From model calculations we concluded that in organic systems a heavier hen might be economically profitable, as total feed costs are lower for the heavier hen then for a hen with a lower body weight requiring a diet with a high protein content. For conventional free range hens this is not the case as then the protein content can be adapted by synthetic amino acids. Field studies and cooperation between farmers and breeding organisations will have to show if a strain of heavier hens will be successful in the rather small organic market...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{race of the}} 1950 {{season was}} run on April 2 at Charlotte Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina. Red Byron won the pole.Tim Flock, {{wheeling}} the same Lincoln that carried Harold Kite to victory at Daytona, drove around Red Byron in the 48th lap and stormed to victory in the 150-mile Grand National race at Charlotte Speedway. It was Flock's first win on the NASCAR major league tour. Bob <b>Flock</b> <b>finished</b> second, a half lap behind his younger brother. Clyde Minter wound up third, Byron came in fourth and Bill Snowden was fifth. Byron's fourth-place effort, coupled with his runner-up finish at Daytona, enabled him {{to move to the}} top of the Grand National point standings, 2.5 points ahead of Tim Flock. A crowd of 13,000 was on hand to watch Bob Flock lead the opening laps in his Oldsmobile. Pole sitter Byron then charged past and led for 42 laps on the three-quarter mile dirt track. Tim surged past Byron in the 48th lap and led the rest of the way. Lash LaRue, Western movie star, greeted Flock in victory lane. [...] "This is my biggest win," [...] said the happy Flock. [...] "To win a Grand National race is a dream come true." [...] June Cleveland was running in the top five when he flipped his Buick in the 85th lap. The roof was pancaked, and Cleveland was transported to a Charlotte hospital with cuts. He was reported not to be seriously injured. His crash occurred in the exact spot where Virginia driver Jesse Elmo [...] "Hank" [...] Stanley was killed a few weeks earlier in a Modified Sportsman race. Curtis Turner, Lee Petty, Buck Baker, Fonty Flock and Bill Blair—all rated as pre-race threats—failed to finish the 200-lap grind.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawing room}} was {{decorated}} in blue <b>flock</b> paper (silk <b>finished</b> paper overlaid with velvet designs). The family {{was given a}} green and white marble fireplace for the drawing room from the father of Davina's aunt, Alice Crichton. He had bought it from the Crichtons home in Dublin {{in exchange for a}} bottle of whisky. In the library, the red flock paper was removed and the current panelling was installed by the great decorators of that era, Lenygon.|$|R
50|$|Bob Flock won the pole. Glenn Dunaway was {{declared}} the original winner, but a post-race inspection revealed that {{his car was}} fitted with illegal springs, causing NASCAR to disqualify him.

Other famous drivers to finish in the Top 10 include: Fonty Flock, Red Byron, Tim Flock, and Curtis Turner. Famous drivers to finish outside of the Top 10 include: Buck Baker, Jack Smith, Lee Petty, Herb Thomas, and Bob <b>Flock.</b> Sara Christian <b>finished</b> 14th {{to become the first}} female to start in a NASCAR race.|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} October 1996 through December 2000, {{a total of}} 7163 pooled faecal samples of laying hen and broiler flocks, finishing-pig herds and veal herds were {{examined}} {{for the presence of}} Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O 157 as part of a national monitoring programme in The Netherlands. Isolates were tested for eae and VT genes. Risk factors for Dutch veal herds were quantified. For all herd/flock types, faecal samples were cultured for E. coli O 157. Of broiler flocks, laying <b>flocks</b> and <b>finishing</b> pig herds, respectively, 1. 7 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 4 % were E. coli O 157 positive. In total, 42 of the 454 veal herds (9. 3 %) showed at least one positive pooled sample. E. coli O 157 -positive herds were compared (with logistic regression) to negative herds, regarding variables obtained from the questionnaire taken from the farm manager. To account for season, a sine function was included in the logistic regression as offset variable. In the final model, `pink-veal production¿ (compared to white-veal production), `group housing of the sampled herd¿ (compared to individual housing), `more than one stable present¿ (compared to one stable present), `hygienic measures regarding visitors¿ (compared to no hygienic measures), `interval arrival-sampling of a herd of > 20 weeks¿ (compared to ¿ 10 weeks), and `presence of other farms within 1 km¿ (compared to no presence of farm...|$|R

The event was staged {{on the same day}} as the Indianapolis 500 — hence the {{ironically}} title [...] "Poor Man's 500". Jimmy Florian won the pole. Bill Rexford of Conewango Valley, New York stalked Curtis Turner for over half the race, then took command to win the [...] "Poor Man's 500", a 100-miler at Canfield Speedway.Rexford took the lead in the 121st lap and went on to beat runner-up Glenn Dunnaway by two laps. Lloyd Moore finished third and took the lead in the Grand National point standings by 36.5 points over Tim <b>Flock,</b> who <b>finished</b> ninth. Lee Petty crossed the finish line in fourth place and Bill Blair took fifth. The promoters did pay some lap money, with $5 going to the leader of each lap from the 101 through the 200. Rexford's earnings came to $1,400 with the lap money.Turner led the first 120 laps before his engine went sour. He departed after 133 laps and wound up 19th. A crowd of 11,000 showed up on Memorial Day and watched Al Gross, former stunt car driver for the Jimmy Lynch Thrill Show, flip his Olds in the ninth lap. Gross suffered a broken back and was taken to the hospital for an extended stay.Frank Canale posted the second fastest qualifying time but overheating problems forced him to the sidelines after 74 laps. Joe Merola was on hand with a new radically designed 1948 Tucker Torpedo, {{one of the most controversial}} and advanced automobiles ever to hit the market.
