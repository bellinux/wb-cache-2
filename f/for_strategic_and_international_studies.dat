25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center <b>for</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>and</b> <b>International</b> <b>Studies</b> in Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but {{there is a lack of}} trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to any hint of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E

Despite {{the global financial}} crisis that began in 2008, research by CSIS has shown that many Asian countries experienced relatively low fiscal distress and continued to increase their level of involvement in global affairs during the crisis. Today, several Asian countries are already among the largest defense spenders in the world. In addition, unlike defense budgets in many other regions, including the West, Asian defense spending continues to increase...|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main {{reason for this is}} the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center <b>for</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>and</b> <b>International</b> <b>Studies</b> (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E
