One of his biggest successes was The <b>Golden</b> <b>Shot</b> from 1967 until 1972 and again in 1974. This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers.

He returned in 1974 after comedians Norman Vaughan and Charlie Williams were found wanting. The dozens of other shows Monkhouse presented included Celebrity Squares, Family Fortunes and Bob's Full House. Audiences regularly topped 15 million. In the late 1980s he hosted two series of the revival of the talent show Opportunity Knocks, which aired as Bob Says Opportunity Knocks. He then moved to ITV to front two more game shows, Bob's Your Uncle and the $64,000 Dollar Question, neither of which were popular successes.|$|E
