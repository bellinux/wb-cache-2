500|$|Revenge was {{mentioned}} {{after the game}} by Flyers Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. During a post-game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), he commented that [...] "someday, someone's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> eat his lunch. This is something, in my opinion, that the players should take care of." [...] Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during {{an interview with the}} CBC. [...] "It doesn't surprise me coming from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," [...] said Recchi.|$|E
500|$|During Microsoft's early history, Gates was {{an active}} {{software}} developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role {{in most of the}} company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, [...] "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E

Tommy bore it, and, still escorted by Nat and Demi, marched up to unsuspecting Dan, who stared at them as if {{he thought they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of <b>him.</b> Tommy had prepared an elegant and impressive speech for the occasion, but when the minute came, it all went out of his head, and he just said, straight from his kindly boyish heart, ...|$|R
500|$|Homer's {{behavior}} {{has changed a}} number of times through the run of the series. He was originally [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further explored. In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious about how he was perceived by others. In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as executive producer (seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001), he became more of [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf". Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset [...] now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck." [...] Fans have dubbed this incarnation of the character [...] "Jerkass Homer". At voice recording sessions, Dan Castellaneta has rejected material written in the script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is [...] "boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose." [...] When editing The Simpsons Movie, several scenes were changed or otherwise toned down to make Homer more sympathetic.|$|E
2500|$|Hope {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Educational Pictures of New York for six short films. The first was a comedy, Going Spanish (1934). He was not happy with it, and told [...] newspaper gossip columnist Walter Winchell, [...] "When they catch [...] John Dillinger, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> sit through it twice." [...] Although Educational Pictures dropped his contract, he soon signed with Warner Brothers, making movies during the day and performing in Broadway shows in the evenings.|$|E
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> blind. And , 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
5000|$|Burroughs {{decided that}} he needed {{immediate}} money and that Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it for <b>him</b> after all. He re-optioned MGM's contract for a third Weissmuller film and approved the sale of three of Sol Lesser's remaining four options to MGM, who agreed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a large [...] "authorisation payment" [...] to Burroughs. (Sol Lesser had acquired options for five Tarzan productions from a defunct company, {{the first of which}} he used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Tarzan the Fearless in direct competition with MGM's films.) MGM paid Lesser $500,000 for his options and paid Burroughs $25-50,000 per film.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{the writers}} began {{exploring}} Nathan's past by revealing {{that he was}} once married to a woman named Claudette—something he had chosen to keep from Maxie—and everyone else. In the meantime, Maxie and Nathan become engaged. In May 2016, {{it was announced that}} Bree Williamson had been cast in the role of Claudette and was set to debut in July 2016. Though there seems to be more to the story than Nathan is willing to admit, according to Ryan Paevey, it is Nathan's honest nature that forces him to come clean. Nathan [...] "recognizes how glaringly out of character" [...] the consistent lying is. Though he has some encouragement from Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen), Paevey insisted that Nathan would've eventually came clean on his own—but confiding in the doctor-priest helped hasten his decision. Despite the lie, Nathan fears that [...] "knowing all these things is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Maxie view <b>him</b> as someone that she doesn't want to be with." [...] Nathan doesn't have any cards left to play once he comes clean. He confesses and hopes [...] "their feelings are strong enough to carry them through this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think it's time I {{told you}} about myself,' he said. 'Am I sure I can get work in Chicago? I am, worse luck. Darling, have you in your more {{material}} moments ever toyed with a Boyd's Premier Breakfast-Sausage or kept body and soul together with a slice off a Boyd's Excelsior Home-Cured Ham? My father makes them, and the tragedy of my life is that {{he wants me to}} help him at it. This was my position. I loathed the family business as much as dad loved it. I had a notion--a fool notion, as it has turned out--that I could make good in the literary line. I've scribbled in a sort of way ever since I was in college. When the time came for me to join the firm, I put it to dad straight. I said, [...] "Give me a chance, one good, square chance, to see if the divine fire is really there, or if somebody has just turned on the alarm as a practical joke." [...] And we made a bargain. I had written this play, and we made it a test-case. We fixed it up that dad should put up the money to give it a Broadway production. If it succeeded, all right; I'm the young Gus Thomas, and may go ahead in the literary game. If it's a fizzle, off goes my coat, and I abandon pipe-dreams of literary triumphs and start in as the guy who put the Co. in Boyd & Co. Well, events have proved that I am the guy, and now I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep my part of the bargain just as squarely as dad kept his. I know quite well that if I refused to play fair and chose to stick on here in New York and try again, dad would go on staking me. That's the sort of man he is. But I wouldn't do it for a million Broadway successes. I've had my chance, and I've foozled; and now I'm <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> happy by being a real live member of the firm. And the queer thing about it is that last night I hated the idea, and this morning, now that I've got you, I almost look forward to it.' ...|$|R

But {{it was all in}} vain. The ploughman had clearly the dread of perjury for ever before his eyes, and wouldn't go back for any consideration upon his first sworn statement.

5000|$|Clifton {{concluded}} {{his professional}} baseball career in 1943, playing 150 {{games for the}} Minneapolis Millers in the American Association. Clifton compiled a [...]282 batting average and 56 RBIs for the 1943 Millers. [...] Clifton retired from baseball when an offer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> manager in Minneapolis was revoked: [...] "I {{had a really good}} year. They were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me manager, but then they gave it to Zeke Bonura, who was coming out of the service. I said the hell with it. I had three kids and I didn't like to travel. I started in the insurance business, another career." ...|$|R
