25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> yet been made.|$|E
60|$|Our {{soldiers}} have been more merciful than our Hague diplomatists, for {{in spite of the}} reservation of the right to use this ammunition, <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been made to exclude it from the firing line. An unfortunate incident early in the campaign gave our enemies some reason to suspect us. The facts are these.|$|E

At the same time the more ammunition he carries on his person the better. Mules laden with cartridge-boxes are very likely to be shot, and {{fall into the hands of}} the enemy. In this manner over 6000 rounds were lost on the 16th of September by the two companies of Sikhs whose retirement I have described.|$|E

60|$|The delay {{which had}} {{occurred}} {{had not been}} without advantages for the British army, although the shortness of provisions was greatly felt. <b>Every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>had</b> been made to strengthen the position. Deep trenches had been dug and palisades erected around it, and the carts and baggage train had all been moved round so as to form a protection on the weakest side of the camp, where also a rampart had been constructed.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year Eden resigned, exasperated by the continued interference of the Prime Minister {{in foreign affairs}} and his increasingly determined policy of appeasement (particularly of Benito Mussolini, whom Eden regarded as an untrustworthy gangster). For Halifax, as for Chamberlain and the Chiefs of Staff, <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>had</b> {{to be made to}} prevent an alignment of the three great threats to peace and the British Empire: Italy, Germany, and Japan. Halifax replaced Eden as Foreign Secretary in February 1938.|$|R
60|$|The Budget {{is through}} Committee. We have had not merely an {{exhaustive}} but an exhausting discussion. I am told by ingenious calculators {{in the newspapers}} that over six hundred hours, from some of which I confess I have been absent, of debate have been accorded to the Committee stage. No guillotine closure has been applied. Full, free, unfettered debate has been accorded--has been accorded with a patience and with a generosity unprecedented in Parliamentary annals, and which in effect has left a minority not merely satisfied in all the conditions of reasonable debate, but unable even on grounds of the most meticulous partisanship to complain that the fullest opportunity has not been accorded to them. In all this long process of six hundred hours and upwards we have shown ourselves willing to make concessions. They are boasting to-day that they, forsooth, are in part {{the authors of the}} Budget. <b>Every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been made to meet honest and outspoken difference; <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been made to gather for this Budget--the people's Budget, as they know full well it is--the greatest measure of support not only among the labouring classes, but among all classes in our vast and complicated community.|$|E
60|$|The {{purpose of}} this series of stories is to show the children, and {{even those who have}} already taken up the study of history, the home life of the colonists with whom they meet in their books.

6000|$|It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} {{to add that}} <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> {{been made by the}} editor to bring into these volumes whatever material may there properly belong, material much of which is widely scattered in public libraries and in private collections. He has been fortunate in securing certain interesting correspondence and papers which had not before come into print in book form. Information concerning some of these papers had reached him too late to enable the papers to find place in their proper chronological order in the set. Rather, however, than not to present these papers to the readers they have been included in the seventh volume of the set, which concludes the [...] "Writings." ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} January 1946, during the case against Admiral Raeder at the Nuremberg trials, that a {{statement}} by Admiral Dönitz was read in which he finally admitted that Athenia had been torpedoed by U-30 and that <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>had</b> been made to cover it up. Lemp, who claimed he had mistaken her for an armed merchant cruiser, took the first steps to conceal the facts by omitting to make an entry in the submarine's log, and swearing his crew to secrecy.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{remained}} at Richmond until {{the beginning of}} March, when Vincent took her home to Georgia again, and a week after his return rejoined the army on the Rappahannock. <b>Every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>had</b> been made by the Confederate authorities to raise the army of General Lee to a point that would enable him to cope with the tremendous force the enemy were collecting for the ensuing campaign.

5000|$|One of {{the factors}} that helped the {{development}} gain planning permission was the inclusion of a green roof in the design. The 4000sqm state-of-the-art green roof was designed to disguise the new service station as part of the landscape. With the Cotswolds on one side and Robinswood Hill on the other, <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>had</b> to be made to reduce the aesthetic and biological impact the project had. A bespoke seed mix was used which was intended to mimic the natural vegetation of the surrounding landscape. Species such as birdsfoot trefoil and yellow rattle were included to attract UK native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} {{that there was}} some carelessness in permitting sporting ammunition ever to get to the front at all. When the Derbyshire Militia were taken by De Wet at Roodeval, a number of cases of sporting cartridges were captured by the Boers (the officers had used them for shooting springbok). My friend, Mr. Langman, who was present, saw the Boers, in some instances, filling their bandoliers from these cases on the plausible excuse that they were only using our own ammunition. Such cartridges should never have been permitted to go up. But in spite of instances of bungling, the evidence shows that <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been made to keep the war as humane as possible. I am inclined to hope that a fuller knowledge will show that the same holds good for our enemies, and that in spite of individual exceptions, they have never systematically used anything except what one of their number described as a 'gentlemanly' bullet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Its {{importance}} {{can hardly}} be exaggerated. It {{has been the most}} jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington's operation. Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. <b>Every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been made to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London. From an official point of view it's simply awful." ...|$|E

50|$|As a result, the DOJ {{must wait}} 49 days after issuing a {{findings}} letter {{before they can}} file a suit against an institution.

This is to ensure that <b>every</b> <b>effort</b> <b>has</b> been exhausted before filing a complaint. Although Congress' intent was not to wait months or years to file suit, the attorney general has no timetable as to how long they must negotiate with institutions prior to filing suit, other than the 49-day period.

5000|$|Over {{the first}} fifty years nine volumes of Transactions were {{published}} recording the talks given, sometimes several short ones in an evening, and the expeditions to interesting places, but rising costs {{seem to have}} checked publication in the 1920s.
