Whereas fluid sinks exhibit complex rapidly changing behaviour such as is seen in vortices (for example water running into a plug-hole or tornadoes generated at points where air is rising), fluid sources generally produce simple flow patterns, with stationary <b>isotropic</b> <b>point</b> sources generating an expanding sphere of new fluid. If the fluid is moving (such as wind in air or currents in water) a plume is generated from the point source.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{state and}} elasto-plastic soil {{mechanics}} {{have been the}} subject of criticism ever since they were first introduced. The key factor driving the criticism is primarily the implicit assumption that soils are made of <b>isotropic</b> <b>point</b> particles. Real soils are composed of finite size particles with anisotropic properties that strongly determine observed behavior. Consequently, models based on a metals based theory of plasticity are not able to model behavior of soils that is a result of anisotropic particle properties, one example of which is the drop in shear strengths post peak strength, i.e., strain-softening behavior. Because of this elasto-plastic soil models are only able to model [...] "simple stress-strain curves" [...] such as that from isotropic normally or lightly over consolidated [...] "fat" [...] clays, i.e., CL-ML type soils constituted of very fine grained particles.|$|E
40|$|Temperature dependences of {{longitudinal}} and transverse dielectric permeability of KDP and DKDP crystals are {{studied at}} different values of hydrostatic pressure {{in order to}} determine the pressure behaviour of the <b>isotropic</b> <b>point</b> for these crystals.

In DKDP crystals the <b>isotropic</b> <b>point</b> is achieved at the temperature T i = 300 K (1 kHz) and T i = 253 K (1 MHz). The hydrostatic pressure increase results in the reduction of the <b>isotropic</b> <b>point</b> temperature with the pressure coefficients ∂T i / ∂p = - 4. 3 K/kbar for KDP and ∂ T i / ∂ p = - 2. 9 K/kbar for DKDP.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{detector}} aging in terms of increased dead layer thickness on detector efficiency has been studied using the Geant 4 toolkit. Variation of energy deposition in the detector dead layer with the dead layer thickness has been quantified for various values of incident g-ray energy considering <b>point</b> <b>isotropic</b> as well as extended sources including the circular disk source and cylindrical volume sources.

40|$|A branch cutting {{algorithm}} is proposed to solve the wrapped isoclinic causing isochromatic discontinuity and thus to decouple the isoclinic-isochromatic interaction of photoelastic phase maps. Rather than pixel by pixel, the branch-cutting isoclinic wrapped map is then restored by a modified regional approach and is {{proved to be more}} time-effective and less effort needed than the author's earlier algorithm. The decoupled isochromatic data can be handled easily afterward. Two type of simulated samples (i. e., specimens with and without <b>isotropic</b> <b>points)</b> are used to detail why and how isoclinic and isochromatic are interactive with each other and the decoupling method of the present study. Experimental works prove the effectiveness, robustness and simplicity of the newly developed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
