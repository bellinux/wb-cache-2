I'm only an old lady who can do little but sit by her window and knit, but eyes were made for seeing, and I use mine for that purpose. When I see the good and beautiful things--and a body need never look for the other kind, you know--the things God planned {{from the beginning and}} brought about in spite of the counter plans and schemes of men, I feel such a deep joy that I'm glad, even at seventy-five, to be alive in a world where such things come to pass. And if ever God meant and made two people for each other, those people were Doctor John and Marcella Barry; and that is what I always tell folk who come here commenting on the difference in their ages.

5000|$|When Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest {{he came to}} Sebastian's Sydney {{studio to}} record the rap. He already had two {{versions}} prepared, one with war themed lyrics. Sebastian decided to use that one without listening to the other one. Fiasco said {{he came into the}} studio with other rap pieces as well. One was the phrase [...] "Hope the wound heals but it never does, that's cause you're at war with love". He explained that he does not feel fully confident musically when collaborating with other artists, and he had been prepared to discard those lines if Sebastian didn't like them. Sebastian decided to use the phrase as the intro and also three times in the bridge with slight variations to some of the words. It became the second hook in the song. Fiasco said, [...] "I didn't recognise that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it as a filler and maybe it will work.

5000|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the typically single-issue team-up stories, the supporting cast of Spider-Man's other titles rarely appeared in Marvel Team-Up. The series often featured non-superhero characters in the co-star slot. A multi-issue time travel story arc began in issue #41 with Spider-Man and the Scarlet Witch traveling to the Salem witch trials in 1692, and pushed the barriers of continuity by having Spider-Man team up with characters who had no established connection to the mainstream Marvel Universe, such as Deathlok. Though the series did often team Spider-Man with other highly popular characters, it regularly gave the co-star slot to obscure characters that the average reader was unlikely to even recognize, particularly during writer J. M. DeMatteis's run. DeMatteis recounted, [...] "I was always attracted to the more obscure characters, mainly because they were ripe for exploration. You could crack them open and really develop them. ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> these fringe characters as more inviting than the mainstream, more established characters - who all had their set-in-stone continuity. I wanted room to play and those characters gave me all the room I wanted. And let's face it, our lead character was as mainstream as you can get, so the obscure ones made for a nice contrast." ...|$|E

He outranked me by far.He said, “You a fan Joan Baez?”I said, “How many records do you have to have to be a fan?”He said, “I guess three.”I said, “I guess I’m a fan. I’ve got five.”He said, “You have to get rid of the records or leave the building.”I couldn’t believe it.I said, “I can’t play the music I want, music that was made in the USA?”He said, “No, you’ll have to leave the building. That’s anti-military music.” She was singing “With God on Our Side”, I think, at the time.I said, “I think I agree with lyrics. I’m not anti-military, and I agree with what she’s singing in her songs.”He said, “You’ll have to leave the building.”I said, “Hey, it’s okay with me.”So he gave me a transfer…I went down to the Hilton Castille in Madrid and I stayed in one of the best rooms they had, and the government had to pick up the tab.|$|E
5000|$|Phil Manzanera {{has said}} of the title track, [...] "Avalon", [...] "When we were {{recording}} {{the third or fourth}} album in London we'd often be working in the same studio as Bob Marley, who'd be downstairs doing all of those famous albums.

We were actually mixing the album, and the version of the song that we'd done just wasn't working out, so as we were mixing we recut the entire song with a completely different groove. We finished it off the last weekend we were mixing. We put some percussion on and some drums on, and then on the Sunday, in the quiet studio time they used to let local bands come in to do demos, Bryan and I popped out for a coffee, and we heard a girl singing in the studio next door. It was a Haitian band that had come in to do some demos, and Bryan and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other and went 'What a fantastic voice!' That turned out to be Yanick Etienne, who sang all the high stuff on 'Avalon'. She didn't speak a word of English. Her boyfriend, who was the band's manager, came in and translated. And then the next day we mixed it." ...|$|E
