60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> {{patted his}} hair, and resumed his peregrination. Damn the Roman Forum; he hated those dreary photographs.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> {{taking his}} arm off her shoulder, and confronted Almayer, {{who looked at}} them both with an {{expression}} of concentrated fury.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no use for}} him, Comrade Brady," [...] he said. [...] "Our ride {{together}} gave me as much of his {{society as}} I desire for to-day. Unless you or either of your friends are collecting Parkers, I propose that we leave him where he is. We may as well take the gun, however. In my opinion, Comrade Parker is not the proper man {{to have such a}} weapon. He is too prone to go firing it off in any direction at a moment's notice, causing inconvenience to all." [...] He groped {{on the floor of the}} cab for the revolver. [...] "Now, Comrade Brady," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>straightening</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> [...] "I am at your disposal. Shall we be pushing on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--no!" [...] he said slowly. [...] "I--didn't--go--with--no--Bill--to--help--clear--the road! I--don't--reckon--TO go--with--no--Bill--to--clear--ANY road! I've just whittled {{this thing}} {{down to a}} pint, and it's this--I ain't no stage kempany's nigger! So far as turnin' out and warnin' 'em agin goin' to smash over a fallen tree, and slap down into the canyon with a passel of innercent passengers, I'm that much a white man, but I ain't no NIGGER to work {{clearing}} things away for 'em, nor I ain't no scrub to work beside 'em." [...] <b>He</b> slowly <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> again, and, with his former apathetic air, looking down upon {{one of the women}} who was setting a coffee-pot on the coals, added, [...] "But I reckon my old woman here kin give you some coffee and whiskey--of you keer for it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> suddenly, with {{a little}} {{forceful}} gesture.|$|R
60|$|But when Theseus {{heard the}} story, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> {{so that he}} seemed taller than ever before; and as for his face it was indignant, despiteful, bold, tender, and compassionate, all in one look.|$|E
6000|$|Burton Ellis's handsome, boyish {{face flushed}} darkly crimson {{to the roots}} of his curly black hair. Something in the father's tone roused anger and {{rebellion}} in the son. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> from the turnip row he was hoeing, looked his father squarely in the face, and said quietly, ...|$|E
60|$|Charles Gould walked rapidly {{round the}} table, and, seizing her hands, bent down, {{pressing}} {{them both to}} his lips. Before <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> again to his full height she had disengaged one to smooth his cheek with a light touch, {{as if he were}} a little boy.|$|E
60|$|There was consternation in Waynefleet's face, but <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> with an effort.|$|R
60|$|Thorne laughed rather strangely as, with {{a little}} instinctive movement, <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Max {{watched her}} for some moments. Then {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself,</b> pushed back his brown hair that was brushed {{up in the}} German fashion, and crossed himself, dropping his knee as before an altar; crossed himself and dropped his knee once more; and then a third time crossed himself and inclined before the altar. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> again, and turned aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{feel very}} bad {{if the old}} woman served me in the same way," [...] Master Plummer said, with a long-drawn sigh, as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> in the wooden chair. [...] "I'd rather lay right {{down on the floor}} an' go to sleep than do {{anything}} else I know of." ...|$|E
60|$|But if {{he thought}} but little of his visitor's {{appearance}} at first, he soon changed his sentiments toward him, for Tom had not spoken twenty words when Mr. Chillingsworth's whole aspect changed. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> in his seat, laid aside his pipe, pushed away his glass of Madeira, and bade Tom take a chair.|$|E
60|$|With obliging alacrity Babalatchi {{put some}} dry {{brushwood}} on the coals from a handy pile, keeping {{all the time}} a watchful eye on Willems. When <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> his hand wandered almost involuntarily towards his left side to feel the handle of a kriss amongst the folds of his sarong, but he tried to look unconcerned under the angry stare.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> {{and stood}} {{regarding}} her. The basket of roses lay overturned between them.|$|R
60|$|Charlie <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> {{as if with}} an effort, {{and raised}} his cudgel.|$|R
60|$|Tony {{rose and}} stooped over her chair, {{but the girl}} made a little {{restraining}} gesture, and <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|Adam bent himself double, {{and with}} an almost motherly {{tenderness}} stroked her bright red hair. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> spat modestly in the dust, and, with face still mottled by our recent experience, expressed the opinion {{that the man was}} [...] "one of them low blackguards--excusing plain English, miss--who'd steal your chickens out of the very saucepan." [...] As for the woman--words failed him.|$|E
60|$|A twisted {{flash of}} pain shot across the painter's face. He {{paused for a}} moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right had he to pry {{into the life of}} Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> {{and walked over to the}} fireplace, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frost-like ashes and their {{throbbing}} cores of flame.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was almost}} a petrifying surprise. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> {{in his chair and}} {{deliberately}} and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows, first one and then the other. At last he softly pushed his plate away, set his glass directly in front of him, held on to it with his left hand, and proceeded to pour with his right. This time he observed that nothing came. He turned the bottle clear upside down; still nothing issued from it; a plaintive look came into his face, and he said, as if to himself, ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself.</b> His {{back was}} towards her. She put her two {{hands on his}} sides, and ran them quickly down.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightens</b> <b>himself,</b> recoils a step, {{and looks}} down at her in a dread amazement; for he seems to know her.|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. Not an Irishman! [He is so {{amazed by}} the {{statement}} that <b>he</b> <b>straightens</b> <b>himself</b> and brings the stool bolt upright].|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> with a jerk that {{threatened}} {{the integrity of}} his neck and made his teeth snap, lurched heavily to the other side, oscillated critically for a few moments, and muttered: [...] "Brdgtpnd--." [...] It was too much for him; he went down into his pocket, fumbled feebly round, and finally drawing out a paper of purely hypothetical tobacco, conveyed it to his mouth and bit off about two-thirds of it, which he masticated with much apparent benefit to his understanding, offering what was left to me. He then resumed the conversation with the easy familiarity of one who has established a claim to respectful attention: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You're a dear!' he says; {{and with}} that I took up his hand and kissed it, for I {{remember}} his poor dear mother so well, that was dead only a year. Well, with that {{he turned his head}} away, and when I took him by the shoulders and turned him round--he is only a young boy, ma'am, for all he is so big--I saw that the tears were rolling down his cheeks. With that I laid his head on my breast--I've had children of my own, ma'am, as you know, though they're all gone. He came willing enough, and sobbed for a little bit. Then <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> and I stood respectfully beside him.|$|E
6000|$|But if {{he thought}} but little of his visitor's {{appearance}} at first, he soon changed his sentiments towards him, for Tom had not spoken twenty words when Mr. Chillingsworth's whole aspect changed. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> in his seat, laid aside his pipe, pushed away his glass of Madeira, and bade Tom take a chair. He listened without a word as Tom Chist told of the buried treasure, of how {{he had seen the}} poor negro murdered, and of how he and Parson Jones had recovered the chest again. Only once did Mr. Chillingsworth interrupt the narrative. [...] "And to think," [...] he cried, [...] "that the villain this very day walks about New York town as though he were an honest man, ruffling it with the best of us! But if we can only get hold of these log-books you speak of. Go on; tell me more of this." ...|$|E
60|$|Courthorne {{glanced down}} at the deerskin jacket and smiled as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> into a {{caricature}} of Winston's mounted attitude. It was done cleverly.|$|R
60|$|I {{had only}} a glimpse of him as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> {{and walked out of}} the pool of light into the Square, but it was enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only eight-twenty," [...] grumbled the fellow, slowly. [...] "I {{knew you}} was off. You don't--What's up?" [...] And {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> {{and stared at}} Walter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monday, {{there were}} the odd jobs about the house to be begun. He was by this time just sober enough to do his work, and just tipsy enough to take a spiteful {{pleasure}} in persecuting his wife. He {{went out and got}} the things he wanted, and came back and called for me. A skilled workman like he was (he said) wanted a journeyman under him. There were things which it was beneath a skilled workman to do for himself. He was not going to call in a man or a boy, and then have to pay them. He was going to get it done for nothing, and he meant to make a journeyman of me. Half tipsy and half sober, he went on talking like that, and laying out his things, all quite right, as he wanted them. When they were ready <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> and he gave me his orders what I was to do.|$|E
6000|$|Almayer called aloud for {{his wife}} and daughter, but {{receiving}} no response, stood listening intently. The murmur of the crowd reached him faintly, bringing with it the assurance of some unusual event. He glanced at the river just as he was going to leave the verandah and checked himself {{at the sight of a}} small canoe crossing over from the Rajah's landing-place. The solitary occupant (in whom Almayer soon recognised Babalatchi) effected the crossing a little below the house and paddled up to the Lingard jetty in the dead water under the bank. Babalatchi clambered out slowly and went on fastening his canoe with fastidious care, as if not in a hurry to meet Almayer, whom he saw looking at him from the verandah. This delay gave Almayer time to notice and greatly wonder at Babalatchi's official get-up. The statesman of Sambir was clad in a costume befitting his high rank. A loudly checkered sarong encircled his waist, and from its many folds peeped out the silver hilt of the kriss that saw the light only on great festivals or during official receptions. Over the left shoulder and across the otherwise unclad breast of the aged diplomatist glistened a patent leather belt bearing a brass plate with the arms of Netherlands under the inscription, [...] "Sultan of Sambir." [...] Babalatchi's head was covered by a red turban, whose fringed ends falling over the left cheek and shoulder gave to his aged face a ludicrous expression of joyous recklessness. When the canoe was at last fastened to his satisfaction <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> shaking down the folds of his sarong, and moved with long strides towards Almayer's house, swinging regularly his long ebony staff, whose gold head ornamented with precious stones flashed in the morning sun. Almayer waved his hand to the right towards the point of land, to him invisible, but in full view from the jetty.|$|E
6000|$|After Mrs. Almayer's {{retreat from}} the field of battle, Nina, with a contemptuous exclamation, [...] "It's only a trader," [...] had lifted the conquered curtain and now stood in full light, framed in the dark {{background}} on the passage, her lips slightly parted, her hair in disorder after the exertion, the angry gleam not yet faded out of her glorious and sparkling eyes. She took in at a glance the group of white-clad lancemen standing motionless {{in the shadow of the}} far-off end of the verandah, and her gaze rested curiously on the chief of that imposing cortege. He stood, almost facing her, a little on one side, and struck by the beauty of the unexpected apparition had bent low, elevating his joint hands above his head in a sign of respect accorded by Malays only to the great of this earth. The crude light of the lamp shone on the gold embroidery of his black silk jacket, broke in a thousand sparkling rays on the jewelled hilt of his kriss protruding from under the many folds of the red sarong gathered into a sash round his waist, and played on the precious stones of the many rings on his dark fingers. <b>He</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> quickly after the low bow, putting his hand with a graceful ease on the hilt of his heavy short sword ornamented with brilliantly dyed fringes of horsehair. Nina, hesitating on the threshold, saw an erect lithe figure of medium height with a breadth of shoulder suggesting great power. Under the folds of a blue turban, whose fringed ends hung gracefully over the left shoulder, was a face full of determination and expressing a reckless good-humour, not devoid, however, of some dignity. The squareness of lower jaw, the full red lips, the mobile nostrils, and the proud carriage of the head gave the impression of a being half-savage, untamed, perhaps cruel, and corrected the liquid softness of the almost feminine eye, that general characteristic of the race. Now, the first surprise over, Nina saw those eyes fixed upon her with such an uncontrolled expression of admiration and desire that she felt a hitherto unknown feeling of shyness, mixed with alarm and some delight, enter and penetrate her whole being.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tired by {{a bit of}} a step like this?' {{cried the}} boy, disdainfully, as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself,</b> and resumed his brisk tread. But it did not last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Squire Braile!" [...] {{she called}} to him, and as <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> and turned round toward her, she besought him, [...] "Do you believe there's any God?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then the {{certainty}} of the thing seemed to dawn upon the man, for he quivered, and his eyes half closed. After that <b>he</b> <b>straightened</b> <b>himself</b> with an effort.|$|R
