40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{molecular}} basis for seed dormancy, after‐ripening, and radicle emergence through the covering layers during germination. In tobacco, endosperm rupture occurs after testa rupture and is the limiting step in seed germination. Class I β‐ 1, 3 ‐glucanase (βGLU I), which is induced in the micropylar endosperm just prior to its penetration by the radicle, is believed to help weaken the endosperm wall. Evidence is pesented <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> site of βGLU I action during after‐ripening. Tobacco plants were transformed with antisense βGLU I constructs with promoters thought to direct endosperm‐specific expression. Unexpectedly, these transformants were unaffected in endosperm rupture and did not exhibit reduced βGLU I expression during germination. Nevertheless, antisense βGLU I transformation delayed the onset of testa rupture in light‐imbibed, after‐ripened seeds and inhibited the after‐ripening‐mediated release of photodormancy. It is proposed that βGLU I expression in the dry seed contributes to the after‐ripening‐mediated release of seed dormanc...|$|E

25|$|Following the battle, British {{forces were}} able to capture most of the German deserters. When the British {{occupied}} the fort at Banjo they {{found it to be}} a considerably strong position with sufficient ammunition and supplies for further resistance. On the summit the Germans had pigs, sheep and 226 cattle. The British victory at Banjo meant that German resistance in northern Kamerun was virtually over. The forces of Cunliffe in the north were now able to come into contact with those of Dobell, in the southwest. The capture of the German fort <b>here</b> allowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> assault on Jaunde and the German escape to the neutral Spanish colony of Rio Muni.|$|R

50|$|Mircea Eliade {{was born}} in Bucharest, Romania in 1907. Attending the Spiru Haret National College, he {{subsequently}} studied at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters from 1925 through to 1928. Traveling to India to study the country's religions, in 1933 he received his PhD <b>for</b> <b>a</b> thesis devoted {{to a discussion of}} Yoga. Writing for the nationalist newspaper Cuvântul, he spoke out against antisemitism but became associated with the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group. Arrested for his involvement in the far right, following his release in 1940 he gained employment as a cultural attaché to both the United Kingdom and then Portugal. Following the Second World War, Eliade moved to Paris, France, fearing the rise of a communist government in Romania. <b>Here,</b> he married <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu.|$|R
2500|$|... a tiny minority, {{from within}} the non-Iraqi British Muslim communities, reacted with {{violence}} on 7 July 2005. To interpret this simply as a [...] "nationalist struggle" [...] to remove occupation ignores the blatantly obvious fact that, first, the terrorists were not Iraqis, they were British-Pakistanis (though British Iraqis have lived <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time); <b>second,</b> {{the vast majority of}} the Stop the War protesters were non-Muslims, yet only a handful from among a minority of Muslims reacted to the war with terrorism. Even though occupation may have caused agitation among the 7 July bombers, these northern-born lads with thick Yorkshire accents confessed in their suicide tapes to considering themselves soldiers with a mission to kill our people (Britons) on behalf of their people (Iraqis). The prerequisite to such a disavowal of one's country of birth is a recalibration of identity; this is the undeniable role of ideological narratives.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillouin {{scattering}} {{experiments in}} air, N 2 and O 2 {{have been performed}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of temperatures and pressures at a wavelength of 403 nm and at a 90 degrees scattering angle. Measurements of the Rayleigh-Brillouin spectral scattering profile were conducted at high signal-to-noise ratio for all three species, yielding high-quality spectra unambiguously showing the small differences between scattering in air, and its constituents N 2 and O 2. Comparison of the experimental spectra with calculations using the Tenti S 6 model, developed in 1970 s based on linearized kinetic equations for molecular gases, demonstrates that this model is valid to high accuracy. After previous measurements performed at 366 nm, the Tenti S 6 model is <b>here</b> verified <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> wavelength of 403 nm. Values for the bulk viscosity for the gases are derived by optimizing the model to the measurements. It is verified that the bulk viscosity parameters obtained from previous experiments at 366 nm, are valid for wavelengths of 403 nm. Also for air, which is treated as a single-component gas with effective gas transport coefficients, the Tenti S 6 treatment is validated for 403 nm as for the previously used wavelength of 366 nm, yielding an accurate model description of the scattering profiles <b>for</b> <b>a</b> range of temperatures and pressures, including those of relevance for atmospheric studies. It is concluded that the Tenti S 6 model, further verified in the present study, is applicable to LIDAR applications for exploring the wind velocity and the temperature profile distributions of the Earth's atmosphere. Based on the present findings, predictions can {{be made on the}} spectral profiles <b>for</b> <b>a</b> typical LIDAR backscatter geometry, which deviate by some 7 percent from purely Gaussian profiles at realistic sub-atmospheric pressures occurring at 3 - 5 km altitude in the Earth's atmosphere...|$|R
6000|$|After {{standing}} still <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or two}} he turned {{and began to walk}} towards the gate. With the movement of his body, the excitement, the romance and the richness of life crowded into his brain. He shouted out a line of poetry, but the words escaped him, and he stumbled among lines and fragments of lines which had no meaning at all except for the beauty of the words. He shut the gate, and ran swinging from side to side down the hill, shouting any nonsense that came into his head. [...] "Here am I," [...] he cried rhythmically, as his feet pounded to the left and to the right, [...] "plunging along, like an elephant in the jungle, stripping the branches as I go (he snatched at the twigs of a bush at the roadside), roaring innumerable words, lovely words about innumerable things, running downhill and talking nonsense aloud to myself about roads and leaves and lights and women coming out into the darkness--about women--about Rachel, about Rachel." [...] He stopped and drew a deep breath. The night seemed immense and hospitable, and although so dark there seemed to be things moving down there in the harbour and movement out at sea. He gazed until the darkness numbed him, and then he walked on quickly, still murmuring to himself. [...] "And I ought to be in bed, snoring and dreaming, dreaming, dreaming. Dreams and realities, dreams and realities, dreams and realities," [...] he repeated {{all the way up the}} avenue, scarcely knowing what he said, until he reached the front door. <b>Here</b> he paused <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> and collected himself before he opened the door.|$|R
40|$|A cryocooled Compensated Sapphire Oscillator (CSO), {{developed}} for the Cassini Ka-band Radio Science experiment, and operating in the 8 K - 10 K temperature range was previously demonstrated to show ultra-high stability of sigma(sub y) = 2. 5 x 10 (exp - 15) for measuring times 200 seconds {{less than or equal}} to tau {{less than or equal to}} 600 <b>seconds</b> using <b>a</b> hydrogen maser as reference. We present <b>here</b> test results <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> unit which allows CSO short-term stability and phase noise to be measured for the first time. Also included are design details of a new RF receiver and an intercomparison with the first CSO unit. Cryogenic oscillators operating below about 10 K offer the highest possible short term stability of any frequency sources. However, their use has so far been restricted to research environments due to the limited operating periods associated with liquid helium consumption. The cryocooled CSO is being built in support of the Cassini Ka-band Radio Science experiment and is designed to operate continuously <b>for</b> periods of <b>a</b> year or more. Performance targets are a stability of 3 - 4 x 10 (exp - 15) (1 second less than or equal to tau less than or equal to 100 seconds) and phase noise of - 73 dB/Hz @ 1 Hz measured at 34 GHz. Installation in 5 stations of NASA's deep space network (DSN) is planned in the years 2000 - 2002. In the previous tests, actual stability of the CSO for measuring times tau less than or equal to 200 seconds could not be directly measured, being masked by short-term fluctuations of the H-maser reference. Excellent short-term performance, however, could be inferred by the success of an application of the CSO as local oscillator (L. O.) to the JPL LITS passive atomic standard, where medium-term stability showed no degradation due to L. O. instabilities at a level of (sigma) y = 3 x 10 (exp - 14) /square root of tau. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> CSO has now been constructed, and all cryogenic aspects have been verified, including a resonator turn-over temperature of 7. 907 K, and Q of 7. 4 x 10 (exp 8). These values compare to a turn-over of 8. 821 K and Q of 1. 0 x 10 (exp 9) for the first resonator. Operation of this <b>second</b> unit provides <b>a</b> capability to directly verify for the first time the short-term (1 second less than or equal to tau less than or equal to 200 seconds) stability and the phase noise of the CSO units. The RF receiver used in earlier tests was sufficient to meet Cassini requirements for tau greater than or equal to 10 seconds but had short-term stability limited to 2 - 4 x 10 (exp - 14) at tau = 1 <b>second,</b> <b>a</b> value 10 times too high to meet our requirements. A new low-noise receiver has been designed to provide approximately equal to 10 - 15 performance at 1 second, and one receiver is now operational, demonstrating again short-term CSO performance with H maser-limited stability. Short-term performance was degraded in the old receiver due to insufficient tuning bandwidth in a 100 MHZ quartz VCO that was frequency-locked to the cryogenic sapphire resonator. The new receivers are designed for sufficient bandwidth, loop gain and low noise to achieve the required performance...|$|R
