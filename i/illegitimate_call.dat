40|$|We call changeware {{software}} that surreptitiously modifies resources of software applications, e. g., configuration files. Changeware is developed by malicious entities which gain profit if their changeware is executed by {{large numbers of}} end-users of the targeted software. Browser hijacking mal-ware is one popular example that aims at changing web-browser settings such as the default search engine or the home page. Changeware tends to provoke end-user dissat-isfaction with the target application, e. g. due to repeated failure of persisting the desired configuration. We describe a solution to counter changeware, to be employed by ven-dors of software targeted by changeware. It combines several protection mechanisms: white-box cryptography to hide a cryptographic key, software diversity to counter automated key retrieval attacks, and run-time process memory integrity checking to avoid <b>illegitimate</b> <b>calls</b> of the developed API...|$|R

[...] What constitutes an undue burden is a value judgment, argued Scalia; it should therefore be no surprise that the Court split on whether the Nebraska statute constitutes an undue burden. Scalia moreover chastised Kennedy for feeling betrayed by the majority. Scalia declared that the Stenberg decision was not [...] "a regrettable misapplication of Casey," [...] - as Kennedy claimed - but [...] "Caseys logical and entirely predictable consequence".

50|$|Exon {{shuffling}} is {{a mechanism}} by which new genes are created. This can occur when two or more exons from different genes are combined together or when exons are duplicated. Exon shuffling results in new genes by altering the current intron-exon structure. This can occur {{by any of the}} following processes: transposon mediated shuffling, sexual recombination or non-homologous recombination (also <b>called</b> <b>illegitimate</b> recombination). Exon shuffling may introduce new genes into the genome that can be either selected against and deleted or selectively favored and conserved.|$|R

50|$|Prior to and {{throughout}} the duration of his marriage, Ludovico {{is known to have}} had mistresses, although it is thought that he kept only one mistress at a time. Bernardina de Corradis was an early mistress who bore him a daughter, Bianca Giovanna (1483-1496). The child was legitimized and later married to Galeazzo da Sanseverino in 1496. Cecilia Gallerani, believed to be a favourite, gave birth to a son named Cesare on 3 May 1491, in the same year in which he married Beatrice d'Este. Gallerani is identified as the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine - the ermine was the heraldic animal of Ludovico il Moro. Another mistress was Lucrezia Crivelli, who bore him another illegitimate son, Giovanni Paolo, born in the year of Beatrice's death. He was a condottiero. Ludovico also fathered a third <b>illegitimate</b> son, <b>called</b> Sforza, who was born around 1484 and died suddenly in 1487; the boy's mother is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson {{was born}} on 1 July 1901 to Robert Charles Wilson of Dublin, a stockbroker, and Frances Lucinda Kellett, a {{descendant}} of Sir Henry Kellett. He had two other siblings, an elder brother Charles Herbert, and a younger sister, Edna, {{who went on to}} marry Sir Charles Read. His family were connected to war correspondent Lady Sarah Wilson and First World War Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. His mother was alleged to have had an affair with Oscar Wilde, with whom she was a good friend, whilst in London, which would have made T.G. his illegitimate son. Weight was added to this claim by the fact that William Wilde, Oscar's father had an <b>illegitimate</b> son <b>called</b> Henry Wilson and that T.G. wrote the biography of Oscar's father. This gained T.G. the nickname 'Wilde bastard', leading T.G. to respond in 1942, after the publication of his book, 'I've often been called a bastard, but whatever I am I'm not a Wilde bastard.' ...|$|R
40|$|President Obama has {{repeatedly}} {{stated that he}} views a capacity for empathy as an essential attribute of a good judge. And conservatives have heaped mountains of scorn upon him for saying so—accusing him of expressing open contempt {{for the rule of}} law. To date, the debate has been surprisingly one-sided. One federal judge has recently noted that “President Obama’s statement that judges should have ‘empathy’ was met with strong criticism from his opponents and uncomfortable silence from his supporters. ” This Article seeks to offer a sustained defense of the President’s call for empathy in judging. Its argument is neither grounded in extralegal, touchy-feely notions of humanity and compassion nor based on some sort of radical vision of wealth redistribution through activist courts. Nor does it spring from a post-Realist rejection of “law” as a legitimate constraining force on judges. Quite to the contrary, the argument is grounded in a firm commitment {{to the rule of law}} and a deep-seated appreciation of—rather than rejection of—legal doctrine. Legal doctrine is permeated with reasonableness and balancing tests and other doctrinal mechanisms that cannot possibly be employed effectively unless judges are able to gain an empathic appreciation of the case from the perspective of all of the litigants. A judge can neither craft nor employ legal doctrine competently if she is not willing and able to understand the perspectives of, and the burdens upon, all of the parties. A judge who believes in the popular portrait of judges as umpires, and who rejects as <b>illegitimate</b> <b>calls</b> for judicial empathy, will fail to realize that, while she thinks that she is simply calling objective balls and strikes, she is in fact unwittingly giving disproportionate weight in her doctrinal calculus to the interests of those whose perspectives come most naturally to her. By contrast, a judge who has a talent for empathy and makes a conscious effort to empathize with all parties will not subconsciously undervalue the interests of those whose perspectives she does not instinctively appreciate. As such, far from being the enemy of judicial neutrality, empathy is in fact necessary to impartial judging...|$|R

2500|$|Regardless of gender, {{members of}} the maginoo class were {{referred}} to as Ginoo. This may have originated from the Visayan practice of <b>calling</b> <b>illegitimate</b> children of princesses as [...] "ginoo" [...] upon {{the death of their}} fathers. Proper names of the maginoo nobles were preceded by Gat for men and Dayang for women, the equivalent of Lord and Lady respectively. The title Panginoon was reserved for particularly powerful maginoo who ruled over a large number of dependents and slaves, owned numerous property, and whose lineage was impeccable. The shortened form of the title, Poon, is the basis for the modern word for respect in the Tagalog language: pô.|$|R

40|$|Linear {{hepadnavirus}} DNA {{in primary}} hepatocyte cultures efficiently participates in intra- and intermolecular nonhomologous recombination at its ends. The products of this recombination are (i) monomeric covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs) with deletions and insertions around {{the site of}} joining and (ii) oligomeric forms in which monomers are joined near the ends in random orientation. A fraction of monomeric cccDNAs can serve as intermediates in further DNA replication through at least five generations of nonhomologous recombination in a process we <b>call</b> <b>illegitimate</b> replication. We suggest that the monomeric and oligomeric linear DNAs produced by illegitimate replication may be precursors of the integrated and other high-molecular-weight hepadnaviral DNA forms seen in chronic infection...|$|R
40|$|A control {{hijacking}} attack exploits software vulnerabilities such as {{buffer overflow}} {{to seize the}} execution control of a server program, and uses the privileges of the victim program to make system calls to compromise the computer. In this dissertation, we first present a novel low overhead array bounds checking system called Cash that prevents buffer overflow from happening. Even if an attack can successfully hijack the execution control of a program, we present a defense system called Paid to prevent the attack from making <b>illegitimate</b> system <b>calls.</b> The Cash approach allocates a separate segment to each static or dynamic array, and generates instructions for array references {{in such a way}} that the segment limit check in X 86 ’s virtual memory protection mechanism performs the required array bounds checking for free. In those cases that hardware bounds checking is not possible, it falls back to software bounds checking. Paid is a system call based intrusion prevention system, which includes a comprehensive program analysis tool that can automatically derive an accurate application-specific system call model, which includes the information such as call sites, call stacks, call order, and their constant arguments...|$|R
