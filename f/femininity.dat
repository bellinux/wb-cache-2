This conflict colours the entire drama and sheds light on gender-based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of <b>femininity</b> with examples of what <b>femininity</b> meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{contribution}} towards gaining conceptual clarity {{with regard to}} the task of understanding masculinities and <b>femininities,</b> especially in the Zimbabwean Shona context. Our argument is that masculinities and <b>femininities</b> in Zimbabwean Shona society have what we term in this essay a â€˜supraâ€™ dimension that is spiritual, and it is this supra dimension that we submit has not been given attention in critical discourses on masculinities and <b>femininities,</b> especially as exemplified by the concept of hegemonic masculinity. Contrary to the generalised conceptualisation of the human being as the centre of the universe and the source of knowledge, which is implied in most western social and cultural theories, Mutsvairo (1983) and Vera (1993), as this paper sets out to demonstrate, present us with an alternative view of the human being, which is in harmony with the Zimbabwean Shona cosmology. The Shona world view does not perceive the human being as the centre of the universe. The paper, therefore challenges this understanding and submits that spirituality as attested by Mutsvairo and Vera is a very important constituent of masculinities and <b>femininities...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} ways in which notions of gender, sexuality, identity, and body are reified, destabilized, complicated, and in some cases, politicized by participants within two contemporary, female-dominated, leisure-based activities. I argue that neo-burlesque dance and flat-track roller derby offer women performative opportunities to transgress cultural norms regarding gender and sexual identities, and the appearance and performance of the physical body. My research investigates how neo-burlesque dancers and flat-track roller derby skaters negotiate their “alternative femininities” interactionally, performatively, corporeally, and rhetorically. Using a combination of ethnography, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and content analysis, I examine how <b>femininities</b> are constructed in subcultures created explicitly by and for women, how burlesque dancers and derby skaters embody and perform these potentially transgressive <b>femininities,</b> how <b>femininities</b> are “queered” and/or deconstructed rhetorically, and whether modern-day burlesque dancers and derby skaters view what they do as oppositional or political. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} aid our {{understanding}} of gendered inclusion by looking at how <b>femininities</b> are mobilised at work. Whilst within the popular press {{there is a growing}} neo-liberal discourse about women supporting other women in organisations, little consideration has been given to men’s reactions to women aligning with each other, in other words, women mobilising <b>femininities.</b> Furthermore, whilst studies of doing gender have considered this from an individual viewpoint, we are unclear about how the collective doing gender differs from individuals doing gender. The aim of the article is therefore two-fold. First we consider how, for women, the individual aspects of doing gender differ from the collective aspects of doing gender and in what situations doing gender, or in this case doing <b>femininities,</b> differs from mobilising <b>femininities.</b> Secondly, we consider how men respond when women mobilise <b>femininities</b> as a way to resist the gender order and as a challenge to hegemonic masculinity. This has implications for understanding the conditions and bases of inclusion in contemporary organisations. The gendered order of organisations exists for men when; patriarchy is in place, men are enacting hegemonic masculinities, and women are in a subordinate position. We call this a ‘gender harmony’ and suggest that when women challenge this, the impact is ‘discord in the gender harmony’; a ripple in the still water of the gender balance which makes men aware of women’s presence and that something is occurring which is out of place or unusual. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with women managers in a corporate bank, we show how men react to this discord by becoming threatened by women’s behaviour and seeking to create conflict among women, in this way men have the power to include and exclude. However, when women are aligning and supporting each other in ways which offers no challenge to hegemonic masculinity, this behaviour goes unnoticed and is seen as ‘women being women’. The article makes the following contribution. First, we suggest that women draw on each other as a source of support, which adds protection from mobilised masculinity within organisations. Furthermore, our research suggests that women actively seek to promote and support other women succeeding within organisations and, in this way, they are doing <b>femininities.</b> Secondly, we extend the literature away from doing gender as an individual practice to consider how women collectively are doing gender. However, we found that men react to women mobilising <b>femininities</b> as they become aware of a disruption to gender harmony by seeking to create conflict among the women and becoming threatened by women’s affiliative behaviour. Finally, we make a contribution by conceptualising how mobilising <b>femininities</b> looks in practice and how this occurs in response to men mobilising masculinities. This has implications for women when they are seeking intra-gender support to challenge gender inequality and confirms men’s power to include and exclude...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} our {{aim is to}} explore the {{construction}} of schoolgirl <b>femininities,</b> drawing {{on the results of}} an ethnographic study conducted in a high school in Ankara, Turkey. In this case study which tries to explore the complexities of gender discourses, we were initially motivated by the questions that have been put forward by critical and feminist literature on education which emphasize the necessarily conflicting and partial nature of both reproduction and resistance and the importance of gendered power relations in the school context. Drawing on this paradigm our research tries to address to a more specific question: how are multiple schoolgirl <b>femininities</b> constructed within the context of gendered school culture, and especially in relation to hegemonic masculinity? Our study reveals that the general framework of multiple <b>femininities</b> is engendered by a tension between two inter-related positions. The first one is different strategies of accommodation and resistance to the gender-related problems of education. The second one is the school experience of girls which is conditioned by their differential position vis-à-vis the masculine resistance culture that is dominant in the school.

40|$|Summary This paper {{contributes}} to research on leadership, by incorporating insights {{from the literature}} on men and masculinities. Empirically, the paper {{is based on the}} narratives of three Danish (male) leaders struggling with tensions in discourses of leadership in an interview context. Re-reading of the transcripts in a gender perspective revealed that an understanding of nascent intertwined discourses of charisma (masculinities) and participation (<b>femininities)</b> was implicitly constructed in the interviews. This gave rise to what could be labeled as a transformational leadership discourse, whereby masculinities in leadership while remaining, are blurred. In a broader perspective, a research implication is that while transformational leadership is most often introduced as being based on feminine and participative values, it should not be forgotten that male elements of leadership are still inherent in the concept, and generally in leadership of the 2000 s. A certain fashion and shared meanings characterizes leadership in Denmark, relating to participation, dialogue, equity, democracy, and ethics (<b>femininities).</b> At the same time, corporate discourses related to charisma, result-orientation, and authority (masculinities) are present although blurred.

40|$|Although most {{research}} linking health disadvantage with gender {{has focused on}} women, recent work indicates that hegemonic masculinities can also place the health of men at risk. The importance of comparing the experiences {{of women and men}} has been emphasised and this paper focuses on {{the ways in which the}} social constructions of <b>femininities</b> and masculinities affect how teenagers live with asthma or diabetes. The majority of girls incorporated these conditions and the associated treatment regimens into their social and personal identities, showing a greater adaptability to living with asthma or diabetes. However, this could have detrimental effects in terms of control, as girls sometimes lowered expectations for themselves. In addition, two aspects of the treatment regimens, diet and exercise, were found to disadvantage girls and advantage boys, because of contemporary meanings of <b>femininities</b> and masculinities. The social construction of <b>femininities</b> meant that these conditions were not seen as the threat that they were by the majority of boys interviewed, who made every effort to keep both conditions outside their personal and social identities by passing. The majority of boys maintained a 'valued' identity by feeling in control of their body and their condition. However, for the small minority of boys who were no longer able to pass the impact of chronic illness led to a 'disparaged' identity. The interaction of gender and health is seen as a complex two-way process, with aspects of contemporary <b>femininities</b> and masculinities impacting on the management of these conditions, and aspects of these conditions impacting in gendered ways upon the constructions of gender.
