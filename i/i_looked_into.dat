500|$|Moynahan {{moved to}} New York at age 18 and, a year later, began {{appearing}} in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely-known magazines. Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money. I liked being a model, but I knew it would never last, so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> acting." ...|$|E

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> his face. It was aglow with light, {{as the sea}} itself, and {{the eyes}} were {{flashing}} in the starshine.|$|E
60|$|An awful look flashed {{into his}} face, and, as he {{suddenly}} raised his arm, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> the dark muzzle of his revolver.|$|E

6000|$|TENNIN <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> {{the flat}} of heaven, peering; the cloud-road is all hidden and uncertain; we are lost in the rising mist; I have lost the {{knowledge}} of the road. Strange, a strange sorrow! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> his smug face, and I {{was within}} an ace of {{striking}} him. Then I controlled myself, and my will was snapped.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> {{her face}} now, {{straight}} into her transparent eyes, {{and it was}} plain {{to see that she}} had not yet guessed my meaning.|$|E
60|$|My heart thudded violently in that moment, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> that {{pale face}} of sorrow. Then Fra Gervasio {{began to speak}} very gently and softly.|$|E
