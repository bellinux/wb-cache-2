40|$|The {{multiplicity}} of forest products and their uses, and the conflicts it may cause among the stakeholders and various interests makes forestry planning in India to be considerably complex. The particular features of forestry, namely: its long gestation period and investment horizon (often not matching {{with the social}} time preference); the difficulty to distinguish between forest capital and incremental growth (often leading to over-exploitation and capital consumption); and {{the high level of}} externalities further add to its complexity. Environmental balance is the prime objective of the management of the forests simultaneously harvesting the increment on sustainable basis {{to meet the demands of}} the local people and the society. The conventional method of making inputs for management or working plans in India using ground survey is tedious process and time consuming. The treatment map, for example, which prepared based on ocular estimation results in rather inaccurate and inconsistent treatment types and more than this each division has hundreds of coupes due for working each year hence the above task is assigned to many persons with varying degrees of experience and knowledge. All the treatments are supposed to be carried out according to these treatment maps. Hence the weakness of the present practice is self-evident. The present study analysed the feasibility of using remote sensing and GIS in generation of inputs for forest working plan preparation and the further use of these geospatial database in sustainable forest management. It has been demonstrated that the generation of forest type map; treatment map; stock map; updation of compartment boundary, segregation of working circles, <b>felling</b> <b>series</b> and coupes and site suitability assessment for silvicultural practices and soil & moisture conservation works can be achieved quickly with much more accuracy; consistency and cost-effectiveness by using remotely sensed data in GIS environment.

This {{was one of}} the first national parks to be established in the United Kingdom, in 1951. The highest peak is Scafell Pike, 978 m, and at least three other summits exceed 3,000 ft making them Furth Munros. The mountains are chiefly Ordovician slates and volcanic rocks, with some limestone and outcrops of other rock types. The peaks were catalogued and described in Alfred Wainwright's seminal Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland <b>Fells</b> <b>series</b> of books, which listed 214 summits, which have subsequently become known as ...|$|R

50|$|The most {{influential}} of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland <b>Fells</b> <b>series</b> has sold {{in excess of}} 2 million copies, being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the fells into seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary — and later writers have deviated {{to a greater or}} lesser extent from this blueprint — Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the fells into 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Far Eastern Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 2 of Wainwright's work.|$|R
