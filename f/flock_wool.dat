40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Saddle fit is well recognised {{as an important}} factor for the health and performance of riding horses. However, only few studies have addressed general effects of different saddle construction details within a group of horses. Objective: To assess the influence of girth strap placement, traditional vs. v-system, and panel <b>flocking</b> material, <b>wool</b> vs. synthetic foam, on the saddle pressure pattern during riding. Methods: Six horses were ridden by 3 riders in sitting and rising trot and sitting canter. Saddle pressure was measured with 3 different saddle variants: 1) <b>wool</b> <b>flocked</b> panels and traditional girthing (baseline); 2) <b>wool</b> <b>flocked</b> panels and v-system girthing; and 3) foam filled panels and traditional girthing. From the pressure data, a number of descriptive variables were extracted. These were analysed using ANCOVAmodels with horse, rider, saddle, seat (sitting/rising, trot only) and speed as independent variables. Results: With foam filled panels stride maximum pressures under the hind part of the saddle increased by 7 – 12 % and the area under the saddle with a stride mean pressure > 11 kPa increased by 114 cm 2 in trot and 127 cm 2 in canter. With v-system girthing, the latter variable also increased, but only by 53 and 38 cm 2 in trot and canter, respectively. In addition, stride maximum pressures under the front part of the saddle tended to increase (! 9 %). Conclusions: Both flocking material and girthing have a significant influence on the saddle pressure and should thus be considered in saddle fitting. Wool seems a better flocking material than foam of the type used in the current study. For girthing, traditional placement seems equally good if not better than the v-system. However, further {{studies are needed to}} show if these results are valid for a larger population of riding horses...|$|R
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color.

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial <b>flocks.</b> Long <b>wool</b> breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} explore the {{importance}} of wool {{in the emergence of}} complex societies during the Bronze Age in the Aegean. The 2 nd millennium BC Aegean witnesses the emergence of a highly particular system of wool economy, beginning with the Minoan and followed by the Mycenaean centralized palace economies with strict administration of <b>flocks,</b> herders, <b>wool,</b> and textile production by thousands of women and children. This system monitors annual production targets and surplus production, and production strategies ensuring that the palaces’ needs are met. Textile production is the largest sector of the palace economy and employs the highest number of people, organized according to a strict division of labour. At Knossos, it is entirely focused on wool for a quite standardised textile production; other secondary products, such as milk, skins, horn, lanolin, and meat did play a role as well but they only occur sporadically in the palace records. Regrettably, textiles, as other organic remains, are rarely preserved in the Aegean, so we must rely on the written documents in order to assess the textile production and consumption. This can be combined with experimental archaeology and studies of the numerous Bronze Age textile tools: loom weights and spindle whorls. The standardised mono-fibre and industry-like production controlled by the palaces can be contrasted with a wider range a fibres found archaeologically, a diversity of techniques and variety of patterns and decorations depicted in Bronze Age iconography...|$|R
50|$|From 1842-1868 any {{cultivation}} {{was limited}} to paddocks lower than the house {{and closer to the}} creek. After 1868, Deuchar's pump, installed to deliver water to the house, was used to irrigate nearby fields. After 1880, the benefit of lucerne as a fodder crop was recognised and the cultivation of wheat and other grains began to assume importance. For the following 80 to 90 years, many of the paddocks above and near the house were cultivated for crops, and much soil was washed away.William Ball Slade (1843-1938) was born in Somerset, England, and after some legal training migrated to Sydney in 1861 where his elder brother was practising as a solicitor. After pastoral experience in New South Wales and Queensland, Slade married Sophia Thompson on 1 March 1873 at St Mark's Church of England Warwick, and that year became manager and partner of Glengallan. Deuchar had established notable Shorthorn and Merino studs, and between the droughts of 1872 and 1902 Slade developed the Shorthorn stud to over one thousand pedigree females, {{one of the largest in}} the world. The Merino stud had such prestige that Slade maintained a closed flock until 1916. During that time he developed a heavier-fleeced <b>flock,</b> with <b>wool</b> that was stronger, of greater length and often brighter. He kept another line of Merinos of Vermont strain, separate from the Glengallan foundation stock, and also bred Lincolns. He exported stud Merinos to the Cape of Good Hope in 1888, a connection which was long continued.|$|R
40|$|After the {{formation}} of the reservation in 1868, the government issued licenses to regulate trade in wool, textiles, and pelts that traders acquired from Navajos. In 1890, blanket sales were 10 % of wool sales; by 1930, weavers processed one-third of the clip, their textiles were valued at $ 1 million, and provided one-third of reservation income. Only Navajos raised hardy coarse-wooled churros whose wool is ideal for hand processing. Recently analyzed archival evidence reveals that blankets were transformed into rugs when tariff removal (1894 - 97) triggered imports of one billion pounds of duty-free wool, much of it from China. Thus Navajos underwent a unique kind of structural adjustment not experienced by other American growers subject to tariff protection for clothing wools after 1898. Government officials viewed weaving {{as an extension of the}} livestock industry; haphazard attempts to “breed up” Navajo <b>flocks</b> compromised <b>wool</b> quality for hand weavers and textile manufacturers. For decades weavers’ productivity provided a secure means of diversification as traders marketed wool in the form of rugs to cope with volatile fluctuations in the global wool markets. Evidence confirming the consequences of free trade is contained in correspondence among eastern wool brokers and southwest wholesalers, government officials and reservation traders. Their business records reveal that nearly all weaving was marketed by weight until the 1960 s, with weavers receiving three to six times current wool values.

Corn was grown in these vales (through which no carriage-road had yet been made) sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family, and no more: notwithstanding the union of several tenements, the possessions of each inhabitant still being small, in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops; and the plough was interrupted by little rocks, mostly overgrown with wood, or by spongy places, which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land. The storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone, as places of shelter for their sheep, where, in tempestuous weather, food was distributed to them. Every family spun from its own <b>flock</b> the <b>wool</b> with which it was clothed; a weaver was here and there found among them; and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn, which they carded and spun in their own houses, and carried to market, either under their arms, or more frequently on pack-horses, a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town. They had, as I have said, their rural chapel, and of course their minister, in clothing or in manner of life, in no respect differing from themselves, except on the Sabbath-day; this was the sole distinguished individual among them; every thing else, person and possession, exhibited a perfect equality, a community of shepherds and agriculturists, proprietors, for the most part, of the lands which they occupied and cultivated.|$|R

Approximately 197, 000 Merino rams are sold annually, of which 157, 000 are horned and 40, 000 are polled. The Australian Merino is above all a producer of premium quality white wool. The major determinant of wool income is weight, but the price per kilogram is influenced mainly by fibre diameter. Recording in Merino stud flocks is minimal. Sires are sometimes identified but dam identities are not routinely recorded. Neither are required for registration purposes. Subjective grading of breeding stock is still the main selection criterion, but there is an increasing emphasis on wool testing data. Several past attempts to design and establish recording services aimed at flocks with some pedigree information have been largely ignored by Merino breeders.

40|$|A major {{accident}} occurred in an Italian wool factory in 2001, culminating {{with a severe}} explosion, despite that wool is recognized as the most flame-resistant among the natural textile fibers. The analysis of this exceptional event suggests that, in addition to classical explosion parameters, three key phenomena related to the process jointly contributed to trigger the otherwise unexpected combustion of <b>wool</b> <b>flock</b> suspensions. The first and more important phenomenon {{is represented by the}} segregation of dust mixtures occurring during processing of textile fibers and storage of byproduct. Segregation may isolate and concentrate the lighter component of wool processing byproduct as a flammable dust. The main conclusion of our analysis is that, when performing risk assessment, sampling of all materials is a necessary step, since flammability and explosivity of raw materials may not be representative of the safety of the whole process. The second phenomenon is the enhancement of the combustion of the flammable dust layered on nets as they are subjected to cross-flow of air. The enhancement may be such as to promote transition from smoldering to flaming combustion of the dust layer. The third phenomenon is related to the interaction among the flame, the induced turbulence, dust dispersion into clouds and the layout of the plant. The combination of these phenomena promoted a deflagration of unexpected severity. In this paper, the dynamics of the explosion is analyzed {{in the light of the}} occurrence of the above cited phenomena. Purposely designed experimental tests have been performed to support the key role of segregation, formation, and ignition of the flammable cloud. Results clarify that real-world dust explosion accidents may be more severe than it could be anticipated on the basis of standard laboratory tests.

40|$|In the field, {{we found}} that lamb {{mortality}} was lower (P < 0. 01) in a <b>flock</b> selected for <b>wool</b> staple strength (SS+) than in a flock selected against staple strength (SS-), or a random-bred control flock (R); mortality rates calculated from 4200 records were 17. 0, 22. 8, and 24. 1 %, respectively. The proportion of twins was similar in all flocks, but birth weights differed (P < 0. 01), being 4. 40, 4. 25, and 4. 14 kg, respectively. Biochemical profiles were measured in lambs from 20 ewes from each flock {{around the time of}} birth in an animal-house study, to define potential causes of the genetic difference in survival. In the intensive study, birth weight was similar for all groups; however, gestation length was slightly shorter in the SS+ lambs (P < 0. 05 for SS+ v. R). All lambs had low plasma concentrations of the essential amino acids and glucose at birth, compared with after suckling. Plasma concentrations of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at birth differed between lambs from the flocks with the greatest difference in mortality (i. e. SS+ v. R); that is, SS+ lambs had higher concentrations of glucose (1. 84 v. 1. 23 mM; P < 0. 01) and NEFA (1. 52 v. 1. 08 mM; P < 0. 05), and lower concentrations of BUN (7. 7 v. 9. 7 mM; P < 0. 01) at birth, and for the next 9 h. The semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscle of the SS+ lambs also had lower concentrations of ATP (7. 4 v. 5. 0 μmol/g, respectively) compared with lambs from the other flocks, immediately post-partum. Muscle phosphocreatinine was also slightly lower in the SS+ lambs. No differences between the genotypes were observed in reserves of glycogen, carcass fat, brown adipose tissue, or in neonatal thyroid hormones. In summary, sheep selected for high wool staple strength had lower lamb mortality than the other 2 flocks. This was accompanied by metabolic differences at birth that can be associated with greater metabolic maturity, rather than greater energy reserves...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{programs}} for livestock require economic weights for traits {{that reflect the}} most profitable animal in a given production system. Economic weights are commonly based on average conditions. In pasture based livestock production systems the cost of feed is an important profit driver, but availability of feed from pasture can vary greatly within and between years. Additionally, the price of supplementary feed during periods of feed shortage and the prices for meat and wool vary between years. Varying prices and pasture growth can change the optimal management of the flock affecting profitability. This paper investigates how variation in commodity prices and pasture growth affect the economic values of traits in the breeding objective. We modelled a sheep farm with a self-replacing Merino <b>flock</b> bred for <b>wool</b> and meat in a Mediterranean environment. We optimised management decisions across 5 years using dynamic recursive analysis to maximise profit when commodity prices and pasture growth varied annually. Actual pasture growth and wool, meat, and grain prices from 2005 to 2009 were used. Management could adapt to varying pasture growth and commodity prices by changing sheep numbers, age structure of the flock and amount of grain fed to sheep. The economic value of seven traits in the breeding objective were compared for a scenario with average pasture growth and commodity prices over years and a scenario with varying pasture growth and commodity prices over years. Variation in pasture growth and commodity prices decreased average profit and increased the economic value of all breeding goal traits compared to the average scenario. The order of importance of traits stayed the same between varying and average scenarios but {{the relative importance of}} traits changed. The economic values that increased the most were for traits that had increased profit with the smallest impact on energy requirements such as yearling live weight, longevity and fibre diameter. Our results showed {{that it is important to}} account for variation in feed availability and commodity prices when determining the expected profit and economic values for traits. The results also suggest that whereas variation in pasture growth and commodity prices between years makes the farming operations less profitable, these changing conditions increase the genetic variation in profitability of sheep. Therefore, genetic improvement has more value relative to scenarios where pasture feed supply and prices are constant...|$|R
40|$|Baiting with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) {{to protect}} lambs (Ovis aries) from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) {{has become more}} {{frequent}} in NSW {{and other parts of}} Australia during the last 10 years despite the lack of reported evidence evaluating the effects of fox baiting on lamb survival. NSW Agriculture has developed fox control recommendations aimed at minimising impact, but these guidelines have not been tested experimentally. Defining the extent of a pest problem and the effectiveness of pest control are key components of a strategic approach to vertebrate pest management as it is the damage of pests that justifies their control. This thesis describes an experimental evaluation of the recommended practice of fox control in NSW. The effects of three levels of fox control were tested in the experiment; no treatment, baiting once a year before lambing (the recommended practice) and baiting three times a year (thought to be the maximum farmers would instigate). Each treatment had two replicates. No previous manipulative experiment using synchronous controls and matched replicates has been undertaken to test the effects. The study quantifies the level of fox predation on healthy lambs and the level of predation on lambs that had other causes including illness and mismothering contributing to this fox predation. It also examines the response of the fox population, lamb predation and lambing outcomes to different levels of fox control. The cost effectiveness of fox control is examined in relation to lamb predation and an investigation of the optimum level of fox control is begun. The experiment also provides the first chance to consider the examination of multiple response variables and the scale of field ecology experiments required to recognise a significant response and avoid a Type II error due to between replicate variability even with tightly controlled site selection criteria to standardise experimental sites, and with the synchrony of experimental control and treatment surveys. The study occurred on five sheep properties near Boorowa (3428 'S, 14832 'E) and Murringo (3418 'S, 1483 1 'E) in south-eastern Australia. The terrain was undulating to hilly with a maximum elevation of 660 m above sea level. The main agricultural enterprises in the district are Merino wool, fat lamb and beef cattle production and winter cereal cropping. The native vegetation of Eucalyptus woodland has been mostly cleared, though remnant patches occur. Most of the area is now sown with pasture of Phalaris tuberosa, Lolium spp. and clover Trifolium spp [...] The experimental properties grazed self-replacing Merino <b>flocks,</b> primarily for <b>wool</b> production, so lamb survival was vital to the economic operation of the farm. Over 50 selection criteria including lamb survival rates, ewe fertility and bloodline, sheep management practices, climate and habitat features that affect lamb survival, past fox control practices and prey species were used to select sites Sites were representative of most sheep farming properties in the region, but were also extremely similar in factors that affected fox abundance and ewe and lamb survival, thus minimising variation between replicate sites. The manufactured meat baits used to poison foxes contained 3 mg of sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080). A replacement baiting program was carried out in 1995 and 1996. Fox control programs were carried out over the experimental units and adjacent buffer zones covering approximately two fox territories, approximately 6 km 2, around the lambing paddock under study. The recommended fox control practices described by NSW Agriculture also included neighbouring farmers taking part in an extended group baiting program. In all the area baited at varying intensities totalled 3400 km 2. Synchronised lambing with neighbours was a further recommended practice to reduce fox predation and was carried out on these sites. Lambing occurred during a six to eight week period in late winter on all sites, a practice known as 'spring lambing', and on many surrounding properties so a surplus of lambs was available to foxes over a relatively short time. The benefits of fox control were measured directly as enhanced lamb survival derived from differences in lamb marking rates between ultrasounded flocks of approximately 1000 ewes and the predation of lambs was measured from over 2000 lamb carcases post-mortemed in 1994, 1995 and 1996. A mean of 138 lambs were expected at ultrasounding from 100 ewes and 113 lambs per 100 ewes were alive at lamb marking. There was no significant (P> 0. 05) effect of fox control on lambing performance (the number of lambs per 100 ewes that lambed) Fox predation was inferred as the cause of lamb death in a minimum of 0. 8 % and a maximum of 5. 3 % of lamb carcases during 1995 and 1996. There was a significant (P< 0 05) effect of fox control on the minimum possible percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes, with the percentage declining from 1. 50 % (no fox control), to 0. 90 % (fox control once per year) to 0. 25 % (fox control three times per year). There was also a significant (P< 0. 005) effect of fox control on the maximum possible percentage of lamb carcases classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes with the percentage declining from 10. 25 % (no fox control), to 6. 50 % (fox control once per year) to 3. 75 % (fox control three times per year). The observed results were used to estimate the number of treatment replicates needed to be confident of detecting an effect of predator control on lamb marking performance. The estimated numbers were very high if small effects were to be detected. No significant correlation between the fox density and the minimum and maximum possible number of lambs carcases classified as killed by foxes was found. Bait uptake was monitored as were the costs of fox control...|$|R
