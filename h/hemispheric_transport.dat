40|$|Based on a 10 -yr {{simulation}} {{with the}} global air quality modeling system GEM-AQ/EC, the inter-annual and seasonal variability {{as well as the}} mean climate of <b>hemispheric</b> aerosol <b>transport</b> (HAT) was investigated. The intercontinental aerosol transport is predominant in the zonal direction from west to east with the magnitudes of inter-annual variability between 14 % and 63 %, and are 0. 5 – 2 orders of magnitude weaker in the meridional direction but with larger inter-annual variability. The HAT is found to fluctuate seasonally with a factor of 5 – 8 between the maximum in late winter and spring and the minimum in late summer and fall. Three meteorological factors controlling the inter-annual aerosol variations in the source-receptor (S-R) relationships are identified from the modeling results: (1) Anomalies in the mid-latitude westerlies in the troposphere. (2) Variations of precipitation over the intercontinental transport pathways and (3) Changes of meteorological conditions in the boundary layer. Changed only by the meteorology, the aerosol column loadings in the free troposphere over the HTAP-regions vary inter-annually with the highest magnitudes of 30 – 37 % in January and December and the lowest magnitudes of 16 – 20 % in August and September, and the magnitudes of inter-annual variability within the boundary layer influencing the surface concentrations over the HTAP-regions are 30 – 70 % less than in the free troposphere and more region-dependent. As the strongest climatic signal, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can lead the anomalies in the S-R relationships for intercontinental aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) with the strong/weak transport in the mid-latitude westerlies and the low latitude easterlies for the HAT in El Niño/ La Niña-years...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{transport}} models (CTMs) {{are important}} tools used to explore pollution transport pathways {{and to assess}} the impact of long-range transport on air pollutant concentrations in specific regions. There is growing interest in estimating the contribution of emission sources both near and far on ambient pollution levels. However, quantification requires methods for the diagnosis and analysis of intercontinental transport and dispersion, as well as procedures to track the contributions of specific source regions to pollution levels over regions of interest (i. e. the source-receptor (S/R) relationships). Such analyses are being done with regional and global scale CTMs. In this chapter we discuss the various modelling methods and approaches being used to predict pollution levels over regional and global scales, with a focus on issues related to estimating S/R relationships.

An increasing trend for CO by 0. 33 ppb yr - 1 {{in the past decade}} at Ascension Island is attributed to the combined effects of Latin American/Southern Africa burnings and increase of CH 4 level. Changes in water vapour and UV over Southern Atlantic Ocean (SAO) in future January have dominated effects on the O 3 distribution. More than 55 % of O 3 concentrations over SAO in both present-day and future September are not directly affected by the emissions (including lightning) over the adjacent two continents but attributable to transport of O 3 from outside due to CO and CH 4 oxidation and stratospheric intrusion. High NO x emissions in both continents in future increase the PAN concentrations over remote oceans at higher southern latitudes (> 35 ° S) as far as those near Australia, affecting the O 3 budget over there. Future changes of biomass burning and anthropogenic NO x emissions in Southern Africa lead to a new area of O 3 maximum near South Africa. The resulted O 3 outflow to the Indian Ocean is pronounced due to the effects of the persistent anti-cyclone.

40|$|Understanding the {{exchange}} processes between the atmospheric boundary layer {{and the free}} troposphere is crucial for estimating <b>hemispheric</b> <b>transport</b> of air pollution. Most studies of hemispheric air pollution transport have taken a large-scale perspective: using global chemical transport models and focusing on synoptic-scale export events. These global models have fairly coarse spatial and temporal resolutions, and thus have a limited ability to represent boundary layer processes and urban photochemistry. In support of United Nations Task Force on <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Transport</b> of Air Pollution (TF HTAP; 3 to the upper troposphere during cold frontal passages is twice as great in the WRF-Chem model {{as compared with the}} MOZART model. The TRACE-P aircraft measurements indicate that the pollution plumes in MOZART are too weak and too low in the altitude, which we attribute to the global model's inability to capture rapid deep convection that develops along {{the leading edge of the}} convergence band during frontal events. In contrast to pollution export from Asia, we find little difference in the regional vs. global model transport of European (EU) pollution into surface air over East Asia (EA). Instead, the local surface characteristics – sensitivity – strongly influence surface O 3 responses. For instance, the O 3 response to 20 % decreases in EU emissions imported into our regional model domain is strongest (0. 4 – 0. 6 ppbv) over mountainous regions and weakest (0. 1 – 0. 3 ppbv) in megacities. The spatial averaged O 3 response over EA estimated by our regional models is ~ 0. 1 ppbv lower than global model estimates. Our results suggest that global models tend to underestimate the total budget of Asian pollutants exported to the free troposphere given their limited ability to properly capture vertical convection and lifting. Due to the compensating effects on surface O 3 responses over downwind continents, future high-resolution hemispheric model analysis should provide additional insights into how the export and import processes interact, and will help to narrow the uncertainty of intercontinental source-receptor relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} the thermosphere mass density response to geomagnetic disturbances is of critical importance in understanding how energy deposited in the thermosphere affects satellite drag. The response {{is dependent on the}} state of the thermosphere prior to geomagnetic activity. The recent extreme solar minimum of 2008 results in the preconditioned thermosphere to be a cold and contracted multiconstituent gas. The associated reduced constituent scale heights led to more concentrated transitions of heavy species to light species with altitude. This dissertation focuses on investigating the effects of composition on the thermosphere mass density change during geomagnetic activity, with particular emphasis on conditions of the recent extreme solar minimum. A study of the mass density response to geomagnetic activity demonstrated complex behavior in the region near the oxygen to helium transition near 450 km. This study was expanded to explore the altitude variation of mass density response throughout the thermosphere and identified the helium / oxygen transition to have the greatest impact. Further analysis related the mass density peturbation with changes in the density scale height. It was found that the molecular weight scale height perturbation near the helium / oxygen transition region contributed significantly to the mass density response. The significant role of helium on mass density response warranted the extraction of helium number densities from the CHAMP and GRACE satellite measurements. A comparison between the derived helium concentration from satellite and the NRL-MSISE 00 estimate indicated more helium was present in the winter polar regions than represented by MSIS. Physical models of the thermosphere in general do not include helium. A helium module was implemented into the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). A comparison between TIEGCM modeling with helium and without helium illustrated the need to include helium in order to reproduce the observations. The mechanism for the winter helium bulge formation was also revisited in this work. It was found that vertical advection of helium dominates its formation while <b>hemispheric</b> horizontal <b>transport,</b> once considered the primary process, is of secondary importance...|$|R

An increasing trend in CO by 0. 33 ppb yr − 1 {{in the past decade}} at Ascension Island is attributed to the combined effects of South American/southern Africa burnings and the increases in CH 4 level. Compared to Easter Island and Ascension Island, much less contribution from biomass burning to atmospheric CO is found at the island of Mahé (western Indian Ocean), where the total CO peaks in January–February, reflecting the contributions of anthropogenic emissions from India. We also examine the 2000 – 2050 changes in atmospheric {{composition in}} the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere driven by future changes in emissions and climate. Changes in solar radiation (UV) over South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) in future January have dominant effects on the O 3 distribution.

The sum of the O 3 responses to NOx, CO, and NMVOC perturbations is approximately equal to that with all three precursors reduced together, and we focus here on the response to combined reductions. The most robust annual mean responses across the models are that surface O 3 concentrations over EU are most influenced by anthropogenic emissions reductions over NA (ensemble mean: 0. 4 ppb; inter-model range: 0. 2 - 0. 5 ppb), and that emissions reductions over SA have the smallest effect on the other receptor regions (< 0. 2 ppb). Emission reductions in the three foreign regions decrease annual mean surface O 3 over the Asian regions by 0. 2 - 0. 4 ppb each, and reductions in EA and EU decrease annual mean O 3 by 0. 2 ppb each over NA, although the relative impacts vary by model. Applying these ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O 3 of about 0. 1 ppb yr- 1, {{at the low end}} of the 0. 1 - 0. 5 ppb yr- 1 derived from observations. The ensemble mean surface O 3 response to emission reductions in the 3 foreign regions combined is largest in spring and late fall (~ 0. 8 ppb in all regions). We define an import sensitivity to gauge the relative contribution of foreign versus ¿domestic¿ (i. e., over the source region itself) emission changes for each region. This ratio ranges from 0. 5 to 1. 1 during the months of maximum foreign influence, and from 0. 2 to 0. 5 when domestic influence is largest. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20 % reductions in regional anthropogenic methane emissions would yield an O 3 response over foreign receptor regions roughly equal to that produced by 20 % reductions of anthropogenic NOx, NMVOC and CO emissions.

40|$|Understanding {{the surface}} O- 3 {{response}} over a "receptor" region to emission changes over a foreign "source" region {{is key to}} evaluating the potential gains from an international approach to abate ozone (O- 3) pollution. We apply an ensemble of 21 global and <b>hemispheric</b> chemical <b>transport</b> models to estimate the spatial average surface O- 3 response over east Asia (EA), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and south Asia (SA) to 20 % decreases in anthropogenic emissions of the O- 3 precursors, NOx, NMVOC, and CO (individually and combined), from each of these regions. We find that the ensemble mean surface O- 3 concentrations in the base case (year 2001) simulation matches available observations throughout the year over EU but overestimates them by > 10 ppb during summer and early fall over the eastern United States and Japan. The sum of the O- 3 responses to NOx, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental-scale "import sensitivity" as {{the ratio of the}} O- 3 response to the 20 % reductions in foreign versus "domestic" (i. e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0. 6 ppb over EU (0. 4 ppb from NA), less than the 0. 8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0. 7. The ensemble mean surface O- 3 response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0. 7 - 0. 9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0. 8 - 1. 6 ppb). High O- 3 values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0. 2 to 0. 3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O- 3 levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8 -h average O- 3 above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region(< 10 - 20 % of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50 % of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O- 3 of about 0. 1 ppb a(- 1), {{at the low end of}} the 0. 1 - 0. 5 ppb a(- 1) derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20 % reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O- 3 response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20 % reductions of anthropogenic NOx, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign sourc...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the effect of}} pollution transport between East Asia and South Asia on tropospheric ozone (O 3) using model results from the Task Force on <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Transport</b> of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). Ensemble mean O 3 concentrations are evaluated against satellite-data and ground observations of surface O 3 at four stations in India. Although modeled surface O 3 concentrations are 1020 ppb higher than those observed, the relative magnitude of the seasonal cycle of O 3 is reproduced well. Using 20 % reductions in regional anthropogenic emissions, we quantify the seasonal variations in pollution transport between East Asia and South Asia. While {{there is only a}} difference of 0. 05 to 0. 1 ppb in the magnitudes of the regional contributions from one region to the other, O 3 from East Asian sources affects the most densely populated parts of South Asia while Southern Asian sources only partly affect the populated parts of East Asia. We show that emission changes over East Asia between 2000 and 2010 had a larger impact on populated parts of South Asia than vice versa. This study will help inform future decisions on emission control policy over these regions...|$|E
40|$|Surface-based {{measurements}} {{from the}} EMEP network {{are used to}} estimate the changes in surface ozone levels during the 1995 – 2014 period over Europe. It is shown that a significantly decreasing trend in the 95 th percentile ozone concentrations has occurred, especially during noontime (0. 9 [*]µg/m 3 /y), while the 5 th percentile ozone concentrations continued to increase with a trend of 0. 3 [*]µg/m 3 /y during the study period. With the help of numerical simulations performed with the global chemistry-climate model EMAC, the importance of anthropogenic emissions changes in determining these changes are investigated. The EMAC model is found to successfully capture the observed temporal variability in mean ozone concentrations, {{as well as the}} contrast in the trends of 95 th and 5 th percentile ozone over Europe. Sensitivity simulations and statistical analysis show that a decrease in European anthropogenic emissions had contrasting effects on surface ozone trends between the 95 th and 5 th percentile levels, and that background ozone levels have been influenced by <b>hemispheric</b> <b>transport,</b> while climate variability generally regulated the inter-annual variations of surface ozone in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{exchange}} processes between the atmospheric boundary layer {{and the free}} troposphere is crucial for estimating <b>hemispheric</b> <b>transport</b> of air pollution. Most studies of hemispheric air pollution transport have taken a large-scale perspective using global chemical transport models with fairly coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. In support of United Nations Task Force on <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Transport</b> of Air Pollution (TF HTAP; www. htap. org), this study employs two high-resolution atmospheric chemistry models (WRF-Chem and CMAQ; 36 &times; 36 km) driven with chemical boundary conditions from a global model (MOZART; 1. 9 &times; 1. 9 &deg;) to examine the role of fine-scale transport and chemistry processes in controlling pollution export and import over the Asian continent in spring (March 2001). Our analysis indicates the importance of rapid venting through deep convection that develops along {{the leading edge of}} frontal system convergence bands, which are not adequately resolved in either of two global models compared with TRACE-P aircraft observations during a frontal event. Both regional model simulations and observations show that frontal outflows of CO, O 3 and PAN can extend to the upper troposphere (6 – 9 km). Pollution plumes in the global MOZART model are typically diluted and insufficiently lofted to higher altitudes where they can undergo more efficient transport in stronger winds. We use sensitivity simulations that perturb chemical boundary conditions in the CMAQ regional model to estimate that the O 3 production over East Asia (EA) driven by PAN decomposition contributes 20 % of the spatial averaged total O 3 response to European (EU) emission perturbations in March, and occasionally contributes approximately 50 % of the total O 3 response in subsiding plumes at mountain observatories (at approximately 2 km altitude). The response to decomposing PAN of EU origin is strongly affected by the O 3 formation chemical regimes, which vary with the model chemical mechanism and NOx/VOC emissions. Our high-resolution models demonstrate a large spatial variability (by up to a factor of 6) in the response of local O 3 to 20 % reductions in EU anthropogenic O 3 precursor emissions. The response in the highly populated Asian megacities is 40 – 50 % lower in our high-resolution models than the global model, suggesting that the source-receptor relationships inferred from the global coarse-resolution models likely overestimate health impacts associated with intercontinental O 3 transport. Our results highlight the important roles of rapid convective transport, orographic forcing, urban photochemistry and heterogeneous boundary layer processes in controlling intercontinental transport; these processes may not be well resolved in the large-scale models...|$|E
40|$|Mercury is {{a global}} {{pollutant}} due to its long lifetime in the atmosphere. Its <b>hemispheric</b> <b>transport</b> patterns and eventual deposition are therefore of major concern. For the purpose of global atmospheric mercury chemistry and transport modelling the ECHMERIT model was developed. ECHMERIT, based on the global circulation model ECHAM 5 differs from most global mercury models in that the emissions, chemistry (including general tropospheric chemistry and mercury chemistry), transport and deposition are coupled on-line to the GCM. The chemistry mechanism includes an online calculation of photolysis rate constants using the Fast-J photolysis mechanism, the CBM-Z tropospheric gas-phase mechanism and aqueous-phase chemistry based on the MECCA mechanism. Additionally, a mercury chemistry mechanism that incorporates gas and aqueous phase mercury chemistry is included. A {{detailed description of the}} model, including the wet and dry deposition modules, and the implemented emissions is given in this technical report. First model testing and evaluation show a satisfactory model performance for surface ozone and mercury concentrations (with a mean bias of 1. 46 ppb for ozone and a mean bias of 13. 55 ppq for TGM when compared with EMEP station data). Requirements regarding measurement data and emission inventories which could considerably improve model skill are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we assess {{changes of}} aerosol optical depth (AOD) and direct {{radiative}} forcing (DRF) {{in response to}} the reduction of anthropogenic emissions in four major pollution regions in the northern hemisphere by using results from 10 global chemical transport models in the framework of the <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Transport</b> of Air Pollution (HTAP). The multi-model results show that on average, a 20 % reduction of anthropogenic emissions in North America, Europe, East Asia and South Asia lowers the global mean AOD and DRF by about 9 %, 4 %, and 10 % for sulfate, organic matter, and black carbon aerosol, respectively. The impacts of the regional emission reductions on AOD and DRF extend well beyond the source regions because of intercontinental transport. On an annual basis, intercontinental transport accounts for 10 - 30 % of the overall AOD and DRF in a receptor region, with domestic emissions accounting for the remainder, depending on regions and species. While South Asia is most influenced by import of sulfate aerosol from Europe, North America is most influenced by import of black carbon from East Asia. Results show a large spread among models, highlighting the need to improve aerosol processes in models and evaluate and constrain models with observations...|$|E

To improve model estimates of the impacts of intercontinental transport of air pollution on climate, ecosystems, and human health and to answer a set of policy-relevant questions, these three initiatives performed emission perturbation modelling experiments consistent across the global, hemispheric, and continental/regional scales. In all three initiatives, model results are extensively compared against monitoring data for a range of variables (meteorological, trace gas concentrations, and aerosol mass and composition) from different measurement platforms (ground measurements, vertical profiles, airborne measurements) collected from a number of sources. Approximately 10 to 25 modelling groups have contributed to each initiative, and model results have been managed centrally through three data hubs maintained by each initiative. Given the organizational complexity of bringing together these three initiatives to address a common set of policy-relevant questions, this publication provides the motivation for the modelling activity, the rationale for specific choices made in the model experiments, and {{an overview of}} the organizational structures for both the modelling and the measurements used and analysed in a number of modelling studies in this special issue...|$|E
40|$|The {{dust and}} water cycles are {{critical}} to the current Martian climate, and they {{interact with each other}} through cloud formation. Dust modulates the thermal structure of the atmosphere and thus greatly influences atmospheric circulation. Clouds provide radiative forcing and control the net <b>hemispheric</b> <b>transport</b> of water through the alteration of the vertical distributions of water and dust. Recent advancements in the quality and sophistication of both climate models and observations enable an increased understanding of how the coupling between the dust and water cycles (through cloud formation) impacts the dust and water cycles. We focus here on the effects of clouds on the vertical distributions of dust and water and how those vertical distributions control the net meridional transport of water. We utilize observations of temperature, dust and water ice from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and the NASA ARC Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM) to show that the magnitude and nature of the hemispheric exchange of water during NH summer is sensitive to the vertical structure of the simulated aphelion cloud belt. Further, we investigate how clouds influence atmospheric temperatures and thus the vertical structure of the cloud belt. Our goal is to isolate and understand the importance of radiative/dynamic feedbacks due to the physical processes involved with cloud formation and evolution on the current climate of Mars...|$|E
