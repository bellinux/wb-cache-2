One {{of them is}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> with a speed adjustment knob, attached to the main box by an electrical cable. The other is a pneumatic control box, linked by a rubber tube to the diaphragm chamber, and has two push-buttons, one to add air to the system, {{and the other to}} remove air from the system. The final adjustment possible is an internal adjustment {{that can be used to}} change the amplitude of the pumping motion, but this is not available in operation, as adjusting it requires the main box of the machine to be dismantled and reassembled.|$|E

50|$|Type H {{couplers}} are in {{widespread use}} on multiple unit passenger trains in the UK built from the mid 1970s onwards. The previous generation of slam door units fitted with Buckeye couplers had required a shunter {{to get down}} onto the track and stand between the two units to manually trip the coupler mechanism as well as connect or disconnect the air pipes and electrical jumper leads. In order to reduce staffing costs and cut down station dwell times, British Rail looked to incorporate an automatic coupler mechanism in its new power-door trains. Class 313 units were the first stock to incorporate this. Air-operated Tightlock couplers were chosen, together with underslung <b>electrical</b> connector <b>boxes</b> <b>controlled</b> by a Drum switch, and this allowed drivers to single-handedly attach or split a train without having to leave the cab.|$|R
40|$|V diplomskem delu smo poskusili realizirati vodenje 3 -osnega mehanizma s programsko opremo LabVIEW in krmilnikom CompactRIO podjetja National Instruments. Mehanizem bo sestavljen iz linearnih vodil in voden z brezkrtačnimi servomotorji. Izdelali smo krmilno omarico in vmesniško kartico za 3 -osni mehanizem ter priključili krmilnik CompactRIO na servoregulatorje, ki vodijo servomotorje. V programu LabVIEW smo uporabili programske funkcije »NI Soft Motion« in implementirali algoritem inicializacije in vodenja osi. V sklopu druge diplomske naloge se je izdelal uporabniški vmesnik za vodenje mehanizma po standardni G kodi s krmilnikom DMC 21 x 3. Ta vmesnik smo modificirali tako, da ga je mogoče uporabiti tudi za krmilnik CompactRIO. Ko bo mehanizem dokončan, bo sposoben rezkati mehkejše materiale. In the diploma work {{we tried}} to realize the control of 3 axis {{mechanism}} using LabVIEW programming environment and CompactRIO controller from National Instruments. Mechanism, which is not yet realized, will be assembled from linear positioners and controlled with brushless servomotors. For controlling mechanism we built an <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> <b>box</b> and interface board, than connect CompactRIO controller to the servo controllers. In LabVIEW we used software functions »NI Soft Motion« and implement algorithms for initialization and axes control. In combination of the other diploma work an aplication was made, which enables controll mechanism by using standard G-code and DMC 21 x 3 controller. This application was modified in such way {{that it is possible}} to use it on combination with CompactRIO controller. When the mechanism will be complete, it will be capable of milling softer material...|$|E
40|$|The {{equipment}} that the payload electronic control box matches the satellite Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera must be rigorously tested before {{being put into}} use. The traditional testing process {{is to make it}} with the bulky CCD camera system docking and then to capture a certain image to analyze, this will cause {{a waste of time and}} material. In consideration for the above problems, a simulative CCD camera image resource system is proposed in this paper. The control signal of a simulative CCD camera image resource is usually implemented in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), thus increasing the complexity of the hardware language, and stability will fall and making post-adjustment is more trouble. This paper presents a system which is controlled based on the host computer software. It makes complex code integrate into the host computer and sets aside a adjust interface to the software in advance, achieving with the FPGA circuit board to send the picture generated by the system cycle together. Sending images, image display and serial communication are usually for a thread in the general simulative CCD camera image resource system, this will inevitably cause some problems that often appear in the process. However, the system utilizes a three-run thread synchronization mode which makes the system more flexible, very easy to adjust. Extensive tests show that the simulative CCD camera image resource system has been running with satisfactory results. So it can replace CCD camera to test the payload <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> which is stable and reliable test for the project and provides a strong support...|$|E
40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit breaker box housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet illuminates. A separate switch powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. Electrical banana jacks are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with hook and loop fasteners so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> <b>box</b> are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and banana jacks inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|E
