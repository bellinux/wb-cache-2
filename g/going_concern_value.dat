5000|$|But {{the public}} utility cases plainly cannot be {{explained}} by the fact that the taker received the benefit of the utility's <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value.</b> If benefit to the taker were made the measure of compensation, it would be difficult to justify higher compensation for farm land taken as a firing range than for swamp or sandy waste equally suited to the purpose. It would be equally difficult to deny compensation for value to the taker in excess of value to owner. The rationale of the public utility cases, as opposed to those in which circumstances have brought about a diminution of <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> although the owner remained free to transfer it, must therefore be that an exercise of the power of eminent domain which has the inevitable effect of depriving the owner of the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> of his business is a compensable [...] "taking" [...] of property.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the 2 ̆ 2 <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{standard}} adopted by the Delaware courts as the measure of 2 ̆ 2 fair value 2 ̆ 2 in share valuation proceedings is superior, in both fairness and efficiency, to its two main competitors, market value and third-party sale value. That superiority, however, depends upon two propositions. First, <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> must be measured {{in a way that}} includes not only the present value of the corporation 2 ̆ 7 s existing assets, but also the present value of the reinvestment opportunities available to and anticipated by the firm at the time of merger. Second, <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> should not include the value of corporate control where the merger creates control through the aggregation of previously dispersed shares. In that case, the benefits created by the aggregation of shares belong to the party that created the increased value. Where a pre-existing, controlling shareholder squeezes out the minority, however, the minority shareholders are especially vulnerable to an acquisition at a price that fails to reflect the firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value.</b> Where such a controller fails to present a valid discounted cash flow analysis, it deprives the minority shareholders and the court of access to projections of future free cash flows of the firm. In this situation, the courts should adopt a penalty default presumption that fair value includes the value of control as reflected in comparable company acquisitions. This presumption comports with common law doctrines of fiduciary duty and the entire fairness standard, as well as adverse evidentiary inferences drawn from failure to produce relevant evidence. The controller, as faithful fiduciary, can avoid the proposed presumption by preparing and submitting to judicial scrutiny a valid, discounted cash flow analysis. The opportunistic controller, on the other hand, is subjected to a fair value determination that amounts to third-party sale value minus synergies...|$|E

40|$|The “implicit {{minority}} discount,” or IMD, is {{a fairly}} new concept in Delaware appraisal law. A review of the case law discussing the concept, however, reveals that it has emerged haphazardly {{and has not been}} fully tested against principles that are generally accepted in the financial community. While control share blocks are valued at a premium because of the particular rights and opportunities associated with control, these are elements of value that cannot fairly be viewed as belonging either to the corporation or its shareholders. In corporations with widely dispersed share holdings, the firm is subject to agency costs that must be taken into consideration in determining <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value.</b> A control block-oriented valuation that fails to deduct such costs does not represent the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> of the firm. As a matter of generally accepted financial theory, on the other hand, share prices in liquid and informed markets do generally represent that <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value,</b> with attendant agency costs factored or priced in. There is no evidence that such prices systematically and continuously err on the low side, requiring upward adjustment based on an “implicit minority discount. ” Given the lack of serious support for the IMD in finance literature, this Article suggests that the Delaware courts may be relying on the IMD as a means to avoid imposing upon squeezed-out minority shareholders the costs of fiduciary misconduct by the controller. Where either past or estimated future earnings or cash flows are found to be depressed as a result of fiduciary misconduct, however, or where such earnings or cash flows fail to include elements of value that belong to the corporation being valued, the appropriate way to address the corresponding reduction in the determination of “fair value” is by adjusting those subject company earnings or cash flows upward. This approach to the problem of controller opportunism is more direct, more comprehensive in its application, and more in keeping with prevailing financial principles, than the implicit minority discount that the Delaware courts have applied in the limited context of comparable company analysis. The Delaware courts can therefore comfortably dispense with resort to the financially unsupported concept that liquid and informed share markets systematically understate <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E

40|$|We employ {{straightforward}} proxies {{to identify}} firms in financial versus economic distress {{and show that}} Chapter 11 outcomes and asset restructurings vary according to these firm types. The results from our sample of large bankruptcies from 1991 to 2004 {{are consistent with the}} view that the Chapter 11 process preserves the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> of financially distressed firms while redeploying the assets of economically distressed firms. These results hold for asset redeployments resulting both from liquidations or acquisitions and those resulting from partial asset liquidations of firms that reorganize in Chapter 11. The empirical findings run counter to concerns that inefficiencies and conflicts of interest severely compromise the Chapter 11 process. Further, we provide the first empirical evidence that the put option inherent in lease contracts is frequently exercised in Chapter 11, that the disposition of lease contracts in bankruptcy constitutes a large portion of asset restructurings, and that the ability to put lease contracts may mitigate the indirect costs of asset fire sales. We also find that unionized firms experience smaller debt reductions in Chapter 11 than do non-unionized firms...|$|E
40|$|The new Companies Act has {{recently}} been introduced in South Africa with specific focus on companies in financial distress and bringing those companies back to their wealth. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the new Companies Act, South Africa made use of the judicial management procedure in terms of the Companies Act No. 61 of 1973. This was not a very successful mechanism for distressed companies in South Africa as the Old Act lacked formalised focus on business rescue and mainly focused on terminating the companies through a liquidation process. The fundamental rationality of business rescue proceedings is that a company facing financial difficulty can be rescued which will in the long term result in job preservation, better returns for creditors and higher <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>values</b> for the company, as opposed to simply liquidating the company. This study is thus meaningful in order to ascertain whether or not the introduction of business rescue proceedings will change the culture and/or overall understanding on the effectiveness of rescuing distressed companies in South Africa. Furthermore, this study will also assess and compare South African legislation pertaining to the business rescue regime as provided for in the Companies Act, with similar regimes in Australia and the United Kingdom.

The simplified procedures within these situations are then indicated which properly take inflation into account and therefore arrive at an internally consistent calculation of CV...|$|R
50|$|In {{enacting}} Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code, Congress {{concluded that}} it is sometimes {{the case that the}} value of a business is greater if sold or reorganized as a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> than the <b>value</b> of {{the sum of its parts}} if the business's assets were to be sold off individually. It follows that it may be more economically efficient to allow a troubled company to continue running, cancel some of its debts, and give ownership of the newly reorganized company to the creditors whose debts were canceled. Alternatively, the business can be sold as a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> with the net proceeds of the sale distributed to creditors ratably in accordance with statutory priorities. In this way, jobs may be saved, the (previously mismanaged) engine of profitability which is the business is maintained (presumably under better management) rather than being dismantled, and, as a proponent of a chapter 11 plan is required to demonstrate as a precursor to plan confirmation, the business's creditors end up with more money than they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} explore in depth {{the ways in}} which the rhetoric of the {{standard}} setter responds to comments received during development of a standard. Design/methodology/approach – Previous research has explored the use of rhetorical strategies in accounting standards to construct and persuade as to what is “good” and to silence potential criticisms and alternative proposals. The exploration is extended to the development of an auditing standard and is strengthened by relating the opinions of lobbyists to the rhetoric used in the response. Findings – The analysis shows that, in a situation where the standard setter's position changed significantly during the exposure of proposals to comment, rhetorical strategies in the exposure draft or standard were adapted to match the changing direction of persuasion, with silencing of potential counter-argument evidenced in the surrounding explanatory material. Research implications/limitations – The research demonstrates that those using standards should be aware of the normative nature of these documents and the subjectivity inherent in the nature of the text.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the {{industry}} reaction as determined by stock returns when firms in the electric services industry announced receipt of Going concern audit opinions from 1984 through 1991. Design/methodology/approach – The study utilizes standard event study methodology to test for significant excess performance. Findings – From 1984 to 1991, going concern opinion (GCO) announcements produce a contagion response in the industry on the announcement date {{more than half the}} time. Also, over the event window of the announcement date plus the five days following, six of the seven announcements were accompanied by significant negative industry reaction. Regression analysis suggests non-announcing a firm's leverage and earnings correlation with the announcing firm significantly impact abnormal returns, as does the exchange on which the announcer's equity is traded, the size of the announcing firm and whether nuclear plant problems were mentioned in the announcement. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that audit opinions provide new information for investors in the electric services industry. Also, GCO announcements in this industry normally result in contagion among rival firms.

40|$|Abstract: Responding to {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, this paper examines the role of information flow and transparency in the maintenance of orderly markets. Information {{plays a role in}} markets at two different levels: securities trading activity and fundamental values. Efficiency in securities markets is seen to depend on the availability and free flow of information. Even given good trading information, however, sparse or inaccurate information on underlying values can contribute to the formation of asset bubbles. This leads to an informal model of a securitized asset value as a superposition of pure trading asset and pure underlying asset. The relative importance of these components depends on the state of information in the market. Information on underlying values comes largely from financial accounting. We identify certain defects in going-concern accounting information not addressed—and perhaps aggravated—by fair value and mark-tomarket prescriptions. Valuation of liabilities is, and has always been, particularly problematic. Neither are <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> asset <b>values</b> that are the same as marking to market. We adduce work by Wang and recent efforts of Madan and coworkers as possible conceptual tools for dealing with asset and liability valuation, concluding with an outline of a practical approach...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct an {{experiment}} to examine whether investors view the going-concern opinion as providing information that is useful in valuing companies' stocks. Prior research on this issue using archival data has produced mixed results. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment is conducted with financial analysts in which the auditor's opinion and the opinion of industry specialists (proxy for market expectations) are manipulated. Participants estimated the stock price of a fictional company both before and after the issuance of an auditor's opinion. Findings – The results strongly support the hypothesis that investors perceive the going-concern opinion as relevant for valuing a company's common stock. Furthermore, the participants viewed the going-concern opinion as relevant even when the report confirmed prior market expectations. Practical implications – Using a controlled setting, the paper finds that investors believe that the auditor's going-concern opinion contains useful information. This suggests that auditors' judgment regarding client viability is valued by investors. Auditing standards that require an assessment of client viability should remain in place. Originality/value – This is the first study that uses an experimental approach to examine whether investors view the auditor's going-concern opinion as relevant to pricing stocks. The use of an experiment is intended to overcome methodological limitations inherent in studies that use archival data. Audit reports, Auditing, <b>Going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value...</b>|$|E
40|$|In recent years, nonprofit {{entities}} increasingly {{have sought}} bankruptcy protection. Though the Bankruptcy Code {{does not prevent}} nonprofits from reorganizing, Chapter 11 was designed for and applies best to for-profit businesses. This creates challenges for courts evaluating a nonprofit’s reorganization plan. This Article focuses on one crucial aspect of a court’s evaluation — the fair and equitable standard, a necessary, but not sufficient condition of which is satisfaction of the absolute priority rule. The few courts addressing absolute priority claims in nonprofit reorganizations have held that the rule is categorically inapplicable to nonprofit entities except in limited circumstances. These courts overall failed to consider explicitly whether the nonprofit demonstrated that the plan otherwise satisfied the fair and equitable standard. Thereby, these courts potentially created case law that may be read to provide that a nonprofit’s plan need not allocate all <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> to creditors until creditors are paid in full, as is required by the absolute priority rule and as is fundamental to the fair and equitable standard. This Article sets forth a theory of how the rule, by way of its history and underlying principles, applies to all nonprofit entities through the fair and equitable standard. Application of these principles will force nonprofits to propose plans that meet one of Chapter 11 ’s rigorous approval criteria...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether insider trading {{surrounding}} a first-time going concern audit opinion is associated with a firm's future bankruptcy status. Design/methodology/approach – Hypotheses are developed predicting that insiders of firms receiving going concern opinions (GCOs) trade in a manner consistent with private assessments of the firms' bankruptcy risk. Hypothesis testing involves univariate and logistic regression analysis of 363 firms receiving GCOs between 1996 and 2001. Findings – As predicted, results indicate that changes in top executives' net selling (i. e. sales less purchases) immediately before and after the GCO are positively associated with the likelihood of bankruptcy over the following two years. Supplemental analysis reveals this finding is a function of insiders within the bankrupt sample reporting fewer purchase transactions surrounding the GCO event. Practical implications – The results of the study have the potential to influence external stakeholders' assessments of GCOs and insider trading disclosures. Originality/value – This study extends prior research examining the link between GCOs and clients' subsequent bankruptcy status by highlighting the potential for insider trading activity to serve as an, ex ante, identifier of Type I audit reporting errors. This study contributes to the insider trading literature by identifying the GCO as a specific type of price-relevant information that potentially underlies insider trades. Consideration of the study's findings should include the possibility of model misspecification and measurement error in the variables of interest. Furthermore, the study's inability to isolate the specific factor(s) underlying the documented changes in insider trading is highlighted.

40|$|For {{federal income}} tax purposes, owners of {{intangible}} property generally must capitalize the costs of creating or acquiring that property. In the past, the tax rules for recovering these capitalized costs through depreciation deductions varied greatly according {{to the nature of}} the intangible. Certain types of acquired intangibles [...] notably, goodwill and <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>value</b> [...] were nondepreciable. In contrast, taxpayers purchasing interests in copyrights or patents could depreciate those assets under the straight-line method or, in most cases, could opt for more rapid cost recovery under the income forecast method. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress greatly enlarged the class of depreciable intangibles. The new rules, which are codified in section 197 of the Internal Revenue Code, allow taxpayers to depreciate virtually any intangible. Under certain circumstances, however, the new depreciation rules also apply to copyrights, patents, and other forms of intellectual property that were already depreciable under prior law. The effects of this change are particularly acute when the intangible in question was previously eligible for the income forecast method of depreciation, because the method prescribed by section 197 spreads depreciation deductions over a fixed, continuous recovery period, whereas the income forecast method allocates depreciation according to the actual income produced by the asset. Motion pictures and sound recordings are two notable examples of assets affected by these changes, although virtually any intangible property that derives its value from a copyright or patent may feel the impact. This Article explores the effect of section 197 on the depreciation of property that was previously eligible for income forecast depreciation...|$|E

40|$|Fast food outlets are a {{significant}} sub sector of the Hospitality and Tourism Property Market and a specialized form of business. This form of hospitality outlet has experienced significant growth and change in the last 20 years. Their value as an asset is therefore of significant interest to many involved in the tourism and hospitality industry, not least fast food operators or potential operators and their financiers. However, {{little attention has been}} given in professional and academic literature to valuation methodology, the analysis of the major components of asset value, and the underlying factors which influence asset value. As such the reliability of the valuation process could justifiably be questioned. This paper sets out a working definition of a fast food outlet. It investigates the major determinants of value with respect to asset value and examines the accepted methods of valuation of fast food outlets in Australia as well as establishing the methods most commonly used. It clarifies the major components of asset value and examines to what extent these have changed with the changing business environment. In particular it isolates the role of Goodwill in assessing <b>Going</b> <b>Concern</b> <b>Value.</b> Sources of data include a comprehensive literature review and personal interviews with professionals involved in the valuation process. The paper concludes that an efficient valuation process requires that fast food outlets be considered as both a real estate and business investment. The contribution of both tangible and intangible assets to the value of the asset must be identified. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine when auditors' {{decision}} behavior is rigid and adaptive in the going-concern judgment. Because rigid behavior has been found to produce inappropriate outcomes, understanding when decision behavior is rigid or adaptive can lead to improved decision making. Design/methodology/approach – An experiment is conducted using cases based on real companies to produce information search traces as dependent measures that are studied in the ill-structured and structured parts of the going-concern task. Findings – Auditors are adaptive in ill-structured tasks and rigid in structured tasks as predicted by theory. Evidence of flawed decision making commonly found in studies of fixation and related concepts was not found. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest the importance of explicitly accounting for task structure when studying decision behavior in situated contexts. Future research could assess whether task structure similarly impacts behavior in non-auditing contexts. Practical implications – Researchers and practitioners have long been concerned about inappropriate rigid behavior. This paper helps practitioners better understand when rigid or adaptive behavior is likely to occur to improve decision making. Originality/value – Taking a novel approach to reconcile two well established but conflicting bodies of literature by focusing on “when” not “whether” people are rigid or adaptive, this paper resolves a long-standing paradox. The implication for the literature is that reframing the question and directly measuring behavior demonstrates that individuals are neither rigid nor adaptive, but can be both as they follow behavior that is consistent with the demands of the task when the demands are defined in terms of task structure.

It argues that corporate debt restructuring {{is an important}} step toward recovery from a financial crisis. We then discuss the rationale for, and modalities of, the state intervention in corporate debt workouts through reviewing six countries with large scale corporate debt workouts. Case studies reveal that the costs of corporate sector rescue are significant and in several cases on par with the costs of financial sector bailouts. The paper sheds light on the importance of contingent liabilities and associated risks to government balance sheet from the corporate debt side and emphasizes the need for improved contingency planning for corporations with potential systemic impact.
