5|$|In 1679 a {{group of}} Covenanters killed Archbishop Sharp. The {{incident}} led to a rising that grew to 5,000 men. They were defeated by forces under James, Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Two ministers were executed and 250 followers shipped to Barbados, 200 drowning when their ship went down off Orkney. The rebellion {{eventually led to the}} fall of Lauderdale, who was replaced by the King's brother, the openly Catholic James, known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany. The dissenters, led by Donald Cargill and Richard Cameron called themselves the Society People, but would be become known after their leader as the Cameronians. Reduced in number, <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the moors, they became increasingly radical. On 22 June 1680, the Sanquhar Declaration was posted in Sanquhar, renouncing Charles II as king. Cameron was killed the next month. Cargill excommunicated the King, Duke of Albany and other royalists at the Torwood Conventicle and his followers now separated themselves from all other Presbyterian ministers. Cargill was captured and executed in May 1681.|$|E

The police were able to pinpoint Provezano's exact location by the simplest of connections; they tracked a delivery of clean laundry from his family to the farmhouse he was <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in.</b> His arrest briefly pushed the climax of Italy's general election from the main headlines on Italian news stations.|$|E

Gravano and DeCicco had been <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> safe houses, but they took the other families' full recognition of Gotti as an indication that it was safe to resurface.|$|E
25|$|The entire French {{left wing}} had to squeeze through the blockage. The Russians took no {{prisoner}}s, killing every Frenchman that they caught. If a French soldier survived as a prisoner, {{it was because}} he was taken by Kray's Austrians. In the melee Grouchy tried to rally his men but was cut down and captured. Pérignon was also taken prisoner after suffering three wounds including a deep saber cut above his left eye. Colli and at least 2,000 other French soldiers and 21 artillery pieces were captured, mostly in the bottleneck at Pasturana. As night fell, the French army streamed away and the exhausted Allies stopped. Near midnight, some of Gardanne's men were discovered <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Novi and the Russians went through the town again.

25|$|After {{his arrival}} in 1674, Captain Damian de Esplana ordered the arrest of rebels who {{attacked}} the population of certain towns. Hostilities {{eventually led to the}} destruction of villages such as Chochogo, Pepura, Tumon, Sidia-Aty, Sagua, Nagan and Ninca. Starting in June 1676, the first Spanish Governor of Guam, Capt. Francisco de Irrisarri y Vinar, controlled internal affairs more strictly than his predecessors in order to curb tensions. He also ordered the construction of schools, roads and other infrastructure. Later, Capt. Jose de Quiroga arrived in 1680 and continued some of the development projects started by his predecessors. He also continued the search for the rebels who had assassinated Father San Vitores, resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> some islands, eventually leading to the death of Matapang, Hurao and Aguarin. Quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to Guam, ordering the population to live in a few large villages. These included Jinapsan, Umatac, Pago, Agat and Inarajan, where he built a number of churches. By July 1695, Quiroga had completed the conquest of Guam, Rota, Tinian and Aguigan.|$|E
25|$|The ruling dynastic {{family of}} the Han dynasty was the Liu family, founded by Liu Bang, whose career ranged from being a minor {{official}} (sort of like a local sheriff during the rapid disintegration and chaos of {{the final years of}} the Qin dynasty) to being an outlaw and a rebel <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the hills, to being the King of Chu during the Division of Qin into 18 states, or kingdoms. He was posthumously honored as Han High Founder or Han Great Ancestor (Gaozu) Emperor. Despite his folksy background, general lack of literacy, and what were considered generally vulgar ways, Liu Bang had a great regard for literature and learning. His patronage of literature and the arts, as well as his connections with the unique culture of Chu would set a precedent {{for the rest of the}} dynasty which he founded, and which managed to keep much of the political power in the hands of the Liu family: often this was implemented by allowing Liu family princes a great deal of autonomy in their local areas, thus encouraging the development of subsidiary royal courts, besides the main imperial court; and, in some cases, this encouraged princely patronage of literature and the arts, with some greater diversity and cross-fertilization of artistic genres and styles. Other important features of the Han era include the location of the capital in Chang'an during Western Han, and its move to Luoyang in Eastern Han, the extension of the Han empire into new regions, and contact with new peoples and cultures, a development which was extended by the further explorations by people such as Zhang Qian of the Silk Roads fame who in the 2nd century BC got as far as Bactria and Dayuan (Ferghana, in modern eastern Uzbekistan), and among other things brought back alfalfa and grapes to China. Also important in the history of the Han dynasty is the method of recording words, such as poems. Brushing characters with ink is archeologically attested to during the Han period, including on silk, hemp paper, and bamboo slips. The bamboo (or wood) slips were tied together carefully with delicate string cords. When these rotted and broke, the individual slips would become mixed up, and the text which was written upon them thus have often become scrambled. Methods such as stamping or marking on clay or engraving on stone were also used; and, though relatively durable required fairly elaborate craftsmanship to produce. Little poetry from the Han dynasty survives as originally recorded or published, instead most of the preserved poems exist as passed on to the future by the Six Dynasties poetry era anthologies.|$|E

500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{had long}} been {{attempting}} to adapt the fairy tale [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] into a full-length animated feature film for several years, basing it on both Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm's versions of the story. Disney was considering abandoning work on the film completely until singer Mary Costa was discovered, the casting of whom as the film's heroine finally allowed the project to graduate from development to production. At the time Aurora was conceived, there had only been two other Disney princesses: Snow White and Cinderella, the heroines of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950), respectively. Disney wanted his third princess to be as different from Snow White as possible, but several strong similarities remain between the two characters and their respective stories. Gary Susman of Moviefone observed that both films feature [...] "an evil witch jealous of a young and beautiful princess, the princess <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a woodland cottage {{with a group of}} comic-relief caretakers ... and the witch putting the princess into a deathlike sleep, from which only true love's kiss can awaken her." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Crete in May 1941, the 2/7th Battalion was initially employed in a coastal defence role, before {{taking part in the}} fighting around Canea. After this, it took part in a devastating bayonet charge at 42nd Street, along with the New Zealand Maori Battalion, which killed almost 300 Germans and briefly checked their advance. It was during this battle that Saunders killed his first opponent: [...] "...I saw a German soldier stand up in clear view about thirty yards [...] away. He was my first sure kill... I can remember for a moment that it was just like shooting a kangaroo... just as remote." [...] As the Allies began to evacuate the island, the 2/7th was called upon to carry out a series of rearguard actions in order to allow other units to be taken off the island. After the final Allied ships departed the island on 1June 1941, the battalion was left behind. As a result, many of its men were taken prisoner, though some were able to evade capture by <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the hills and caves around the island. Adopting Cretan dress, learning the dialect, and enlisting the help of local inhabitants, Saunders managed to remain hidden for eleven months.|$|E
500|$|While several {{including}} Robert and his half-brother John {{chose to}} vanish into the night, Catesby, Percy, the Wright brothers, Grant, Rookwood and Thomas remained. [...] Thomas asked {{them what they}} intended to do – [...] "We mean here to die". [...] Thomas replied [...] "I will take such part as you do". [...] Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200men early on 8 November. [...] Thomas {{was the first to}} be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. [...] The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. [...] Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. [...] The sheriff's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff's assistant. [...] His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, as it was never seen again. [...] He and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. [...] Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. [...] They spent about two months <b>hiding</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place. [...] They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley, after a cook, John Finwood, informed on them. [...] Humphrey managed to escape, but was captured at Prestwood, in Staffordshire.|$|E
