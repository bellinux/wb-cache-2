500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky, noticing {{the difference between the}} fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, and thought about making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E

60|$|Mr. George is mightily curious {{in respect}} of the room. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the painted ceiling, looks round at the old law-books, contemplates the portraits of the great clients, reads aloud {{the names on the}} boxes.|$|R

50|$|As Bryan {{leaves the}} place where he has buried Castro, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the {{vultures}} circling and tells them that they have feasted on many things but if they should ever have done so on Castro, they would have feasted on a real man.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the house, and saw Carmina at {{the open}} window of her bedroom.|$|E

6000|$|... "Comin' round," [...] said Tom, with a grin. [...] "I've worked {{most of the}} fever--an' the sunstroke--out of him.

60|$|No one {{doubts that}} an {{ordinary}} man {{can get on with}} this world: but we demand not strength enough to get on with it, but strength enough to get it on. Can he hate it enough to change it, and yet love it enough to think it worth changing? Can <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its colossal good without once feeling acquiescence? Can <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> its colossal evil without once feeling despair? Can he, in short, be at once not only a pessimist and an optimist, but a fanatical pessimist and a fanatical optimist? Is he enough of a pagan to die for the world, and enough of a Christian to die to it? In this combination, I maintain, it is the rational optimist who fails, the irrational optimist who succeeds. He is ready to smash the whole universe for the sake of itself.|$|R

60|$|When {{the bitter}} remembrance {{of that moment}} of sweetest folly rushed back to his aching brain, then <b>at</b> last did <b>he</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her with one final, agonised look of reproach, so great, so tender, and yet so final, that Anne Mie, who saw it, felt as if her own heart would break with the pity of it all.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a sudden {{accession}} of confidence; her interest in the hat had flattered him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her calmly. His {{face was}} round and chubby {{and his eyes}} were big, blue, and earnest.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her then, sidelong. The {{curve of}} her cheek and chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|E
