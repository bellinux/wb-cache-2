40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} frequency, timing, {{patterns}} and prognostic significance of {{change of the}} syndromic diagnosis in a cohort of newly diagnosed adults with epilepsy. Method: 180 newly diagnosed adults from an epilepsy centre were included and followed for 852. 4 person years. For each patient, the syndromic diagnosis was made at entry according to simplified categories. Changes of the diagnostic categories were then recorded retrospectively during follow-up. A change of the syndromic diagnosis was made and dated, based on new data on seizure types and/or EEG findings and/or neuroimaging results. Using survival analysis, the cumulative time-dependent probability of change of syndromic category and of 2 -year remission was measured. Differences were tested with the logrank test. A multivariate analysis was performed using Cox’s proportional hazard function. Results: The sample included 104 men and 80 women aged 15 through 84 years. At entry, 61 patients (33. 9 %) had partial epilepsies, 42 (23. 3 %) had generalised epilepsies, 19 (10. 6 %) had undetermined epilepsies, and 58 (32. 2 %) had <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures.</b> The syndromic diagnosis was changed during follow-up in 54 cases (30 %). The cumulative probability of change was 10 % at six months, 16 %, 19 %, and 25 % at 12, 24, and 36 months. 83 % of changes were in patients with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> who relapsed (45 cases). A total of 105 patients (58. 3 %) achieved 2 -year remission. The cumulative probability of remission was similar when comparing patients with and without change of the syndromic diagnosis (log-rank 0. 11; p = ns), after excluding those with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> at entry, and when adjusting for age, sex, disease duration at entry, and treatment in the multivariate analysis model. Conclusion: Except for <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures,</b> the syndromic diagnosis at entry changed infrequently (mostly during the first year) in adults and {{did not affect the}} chance of long-term remission of epilepsy...|$|R

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a positive acute phase protein, which increases during inflammation. The role of inflammation in epilepsy remains unclear. In this study, the inflammatory response in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy (1 E) was investigated. The aims of the study were: 1. to measure serum CRP concentrations in dogs with IE and in healthy dogs, 2. to measure serum CRP concentrations in dogs with acute cluster seizures and in dogs with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> and 3. to observe the evolution of serum CRP concentrations in time after the last seizure. This study showed {{no significant differences in}} serum CRP concentrations between dogs with IE (7. 8 mg/I) and dogs of the control group (8. 3 mg/I). Furthermore, the results showed higher mean serum CRP concentrations in dogs with IE exhibiting cluster seizures (11, 8 mg/I) than in dogs with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> (5. 7 mg/I).

40|$|Status epilepticus (SE) is an {{important}} neurological emergency with high mortality and morbidity. The first official definition of SE {{was the product of}} 10 th Marseilles colloquium held in 1962 which was accepted by International League Against Epilepsy in 1964. There are as many types of SE as of seizures. SE is supposed to result from failure of normal mechanisms that terminate an <b>isolated</b> <b>seizure.</b> In half of the cases, there is no history of epilepsy and SE is precipitated by some intercurrent infection. In children, it is often infection, whereas in adults, the major causes are stroke, hypoxia, metabolic derangements, and alcohol intoxication or drug withdrawal. The treatment of SE aims at termination of SE, prevention of seizure recurrence, management of precipitating causes, and the management of complications. The extent of investigations done should be based on the clinical picture and cost benefit analysis. The first line antiepileptic drugs (AED) for SE include benzodiazepines, phenytoin, phosphenytoin, and sodium valproate. Mortality of SE ranges between 7 and 39 % and depends on underlying cause and response to AEDs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} epilepsy and other convulsive disorders and the causes of symptomatic epilepsies in a Saudi Arabian population. Methods: Door to door survey of a restricted area inhabited by 23 700 Saudi nationals. The World Health Organization (WHO) protocol designed to detect neurological disorders was used as screening instrument. All patients with probable seizures were examined by a neurologist and 92 % of positive cases were investigated by brain computed tomography (CT) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Results: Prevalence rate (PR) for active epilepsy was 6. 54 / 1000 population (95 % confidence interval 5. 48 – 7. 60). Twenty-eight {{percent of the patients}} had partial seizures, 21 % generalized seizures and in 51 %, {{it was not possible to}} determine if the generalized seizures had focal onset or not. The epilepsy was symptomatic in 32 % of the cases: pre or perinatal encephalopathy 23 %, head injury 4 %, childhood neurological infection 4 % and stroke 1 %. Febrile convulsions PR was 3. 55 / 1000 children under the age of 6 years and <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> were documented in only 0. 18 / 1000 population. Conclusions: The PR of epilepsy in Saudi Arabs is within the range of the values reported in most communities.

40|$|AbstractWe {{analysed}} {{the incidence}} and etiological spectrum of acute symptomatic seizures in 2531 patients with seizure disorder, both in-patients and out-patients, {{seen in a}} university hospital in South India. Seizure(s) occurred in close temporal association with an acute systemic, metabolic, or toxic insult or in association with an acute central nervous system (CNS) insult in 22. 5 % of patients. Of the 572 patients, 8 % could be grouped under the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) category 4. 1 and 92 % under category 1. 2. The seizure type was generalized in all the patients included in category 4. 1 and 78 % of patients grouped in category 2. 1 had simple or complex partial seizure(s) with or without secondary generalization. Sixteen (3 %) patients developed status epilepticus during the acute phase of illness and 7 % of patients had only single seizure. Infections of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and single CT enhancing lesions (SCTEL) together accounted for 77 % of the provoking factors in patients grouped under category 2. 1. These two etiological factors together accounted for 95 % of etiologies in patients aged under 16 years. SCTEL and neurocysticercosis together accounted for 67 % of the provoking factors. In 14 % of patients cerebrovascular diseases were the etiological factors and 60 % of the patients were aged over 40 years. In patients with cerebrovascular diseases, aged under 40 years, cortical sinovenous thrombosis accounted for 37 %. SCTEL was the provoking factor in 61 % of patients with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizure.</b> Infections of CNS and SCTEL together accounted for 62. 5 % of etiological factors for status epilepticus.

40|$|A {{system for}} <b>isolating</b> <b>seizure</b> {{components}} in the epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) is presented. The method of independent component analysis (ICA) is implemented to decompose multichannel recordings of scalp EEG known to contain epileptic seizures into their underlying independent components (ICs). The ICs are treated as a convenient expansion basis {{and in order to}} identify the relevant seizure components amongst the ICs, a series of dynamical embedding matrices are first constructed along each IC. By observing the change in structure of the singular spectra obtained by performing a singular value decomposition on each consecutive dynamical embedding matrix, it is possible to track changes in the underlying complexity of each IC with time. The change in complexity is linked to the change in entropy that can be calculated from each consecutive singular spectrum. The change in complexity, coupled with the topographical distribution of each IC, allows seizure-related components extracted by the ICA process to be subjectively identified. The method has been applied to four seizure EEG segments, and in each case probable seizure components were identified subjectively. As a proof-of-principle study, the method indicates that ICA coupled with dynamical embedding may be useful as a tool in pre-processing seizure EEG segments...|$|R
40|$|Serial {{ultrasound}} scans {{and conventional}} and diffusion weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) were performed on 16 neonates who presented with seizures. The Apgar scores were normal and subsequently no metabolic or infective cause could be found. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the extent to which early sequential imaging can elucidate the cause of seizures in apparently neurologically normal infants. Fourteen of the infants had haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions on MRI and these were detected by ultrasound scanning in 11. Early ultrasound scanning detected the haemorrhagic lesions but the ischaemic lesions were often not seen until the end of the first week of life. Early MRI, however, was able to detect all the ischaemic lesions. The evolution of the insult could be timed by using serial ultrasound scans and a combination of diffusion weighted and conventional MRI during the first week of life, confirming a perinatal insult even in the absence of fetal distress. Although the aetiology of these lesions remains obscure, serial ultrasound scans will detect the presence of cerebral lesions in neonates presenting with <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> but additional MRI sequences will give better definition on type, site, and extent of the pathology...|$|R

Clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) markers to predict seizure recurrence need to be identified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify EEG criteria related to seizure recurrence in RE. MethodsThere were 10 children (aged 3 – 10 years; 6 males, 4 females) in the recurrence group and 12 (aged 4 – 7 years; 6 males, 6 females) in the isolated group. Occurrences of the number of spikes were scored, and the presence of rolandic discharges (RD) in the awake record was evaluated. All patients were evaluated longitudinally, clinically and by EEG, with repeated EEG recordings every 3 months. Clinical and EEG follow-up was performed for ≥ 4 years. ResultsSeizure recurrence and extended periods of high-frequency paroxysmal EEG abnormalities (> 6 months after onset) were significantly correlated (p< 0. 001). Moreover, the appearance of RD in awake recordings tended to be more prevalent in the recurrence group than in the isolated group (odds ratio 4. 714).

40|$|Drug-resistant {{epilepsy}} {{is traditionally}} characterized by pathologic cortical tissue comprised of seizure-initiating `foci'. These `foci' {{are thought to}} be embedded within an epileptic network whose functional architecture dynamically reorganizes during seizures through synchronous and asynchronous neurophysiologic processes. Critical to understanding these dynamics is identifying the synchronous connections that link foci to surrounding tissue and investigating how these connections facilitate seizure generation and termination. We use intracranial recordings from neocortical epilepsy patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation to analyze functional connectivity before and during seizures. We develop and apply a novel technique to track network reconfiguration in time and to parse these reconfiguration dynamics into distinct seizure states, each characterized by unique patterns of network connections that differ in their strength and topography. Our approach suggests that seizures are generated when the synchronous relationships that <b>isolate</b> <b>seizure</b> `foci' from the surrounding epileptic network are broken down. As seizures progress, foci reappear as isolated subnetworks, marking a shift in network state that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations have important theoretical implications for understanding the spatial involvement of distributed cortical structures in the dynamics of seizure generation, propagation and termination, and have practical significance in determining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.

Methods: We undertook a retrospective case-control study of patients with LOE and age and sex-matched controls, also matched for imaging modality. Radiological CVD was recorded, with radiological findings by an experienced consultant neuroradiologist usi a structured proforma. Results: 105 cases and 105 controls were studied, comprising 61 (58. 1 %) males, mean (±SD) age (years) 72. 7 ± 7. 48 (cases), 72. 4 ± 7. 02 (controls). 9 cases had <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> rather than LOE. Imaging modality (in cases and controls) was CT in 59 and MRI in 46. Radiological CVD was more prevalent amongst cases (65. 7 %) than controls (33. 3 %) (p 1. 5 cm) was present in 23 (21. 9 %) cases and 2 (1. 9 %) (p < 0. 001) controls, with small vessel disease (SVD) (periventricular or subcortical white matter lesions (WMLs), including leukoaraiosis (LA)) present in 52 (49. 5 %) cases (LA in 4) and 34 (32. 3 %) controls (LA in 0) (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Acute {{repetitive}} seizures, {{more commonly}} known as cluster, crescendo or sequential seizures, are defined as episodes of increased seizure activity occurring in patients with refractory epilepsy who are already receiving stable regimens of anticonvulsants. They lie in the <b>seizure</b> spectrum between <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> and status epilepticus. If acute repetitive seizures are left untreated, they may progress to status epilepticus. Acute repetitive seizures and prolonged seizures are rated as a neurological emergency and treatment must be prompt. The primary goals of therapy are cessation of the seizure and prevention of recurrence. The use of traditional intravenous agents such as phenytoin, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), lorazepam and diazepam is well established in the first-line treatment of acute seizures. However, adverse effects and the time to onset of effect often dictate the choice between older anticonvulsants. Newer agents (such as fosphenytoin) and alternative routes of administration (such as rectal administration of diazepam solution) have been developed {{in an effort to}} reduce adverse effects, decrease the time to onset of effect, reduce acute care facility costs and investigate the possibility of home treatment. Diazepam rectal gel, a newer formulation of diazepam intended for rectal administration, effectively terminates acute seizures and prevents recurrence within the first 12 hours after administration. Diazepam rectal gel is available for use by a trained caregiver in a home setting and, therefore, emergency room treatment and hospitalisation may not be required and could be avoided. This may result in reductions in financial and emotional costs associated with acute repetitive seizures, but broader clinical experience is needed to assess this. Diazepam rectal gel is not associated with respiratory depression and most adverse effects appear to be mild to moderate in severity. At present, diazepam rectal gel is a valuable addition to the current anticonvulsant armamentarium for first-line therapy of acute repetitive seizures. Wider clinical experience will better determine the place of this formulation in the treatment of this debilitating disorder.

40|$|PURPOSE: To present new {{information}} on the semiology and short-term evolution of seizures associated with primary brain tumors (PBTs) in a prospective study. METHODS: This study is {{a section of the}} PERNO study [...] Project of Emilia Romagna Region on Neuro-Oncology, the main aim of which is to collect prospectively all cases of PBTs occurring in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeast Italy (3, 983, 346 population) from January 2009 to December 2011, to allow epidemiologic, clinical, and biomolecular studies. The epilepsy section of the PERNO study included all the patients who experienced seizures, either as first symptom of the tumor or appearing {{during the course of the}} disease. Each patient was interviewed by the referring neurologist with a specific interest in epilepsy. The patients who entered the study were followed up with visits on a quarterly basis. KEY FINDINGS: We collected 100 cases with full clinical, neuroradiologic, and pathologic data. The majority (79 %) had high grade PBTs (glioblastoma in 50 cases), whereas the remaining patients had low-grade gliomas, mostly localized in the frontal (60 %), temporal (38 %), and parietal (28 %) lobes. Seizures were the first symptom of the tumor in 72 cases. Overall, the initial seizures were tonic-clonic (48 %) (without clear initial focal signs in more than half of the patients), focal motor (26 %), complex partial (10 %), and somatosensitive (8 %). The majority of cases (60 %) had <b>isolated</b> <b>seizures</b> or a low seizure frequency at the onset of the disease, whereas a high seizure frequency or status epilepticus was observed in 18 % and 12 % of cases, respectively. Ninety-two patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor, which was either radical (38 %) or partial (53 %). Seven patients underwent only cerebral biopsy. In the 72 patients in whom seizures were the first symptom, the mean time to the surgical treatment was 174 days, with a significant difference between high grade (95 days) and low grade (481 days) gliomas. At the time of our first observation, the majority of patients (69 %) had already undergone surgical removal, with a mean follow-up of 3 months after the procedure. Overall, 39 patients (56 %) were seizure free after tumor removal. The good outcome did not depend on presurgical seizure frequency or tumor type, although there was a trend for better results with low-grade PBTs. SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide evidence that seizures are strictly linked to the tumoral lesion: They are the initial symptom of the tumor, reflect the tumor location and type, are usually resistant to antiepileptic treatment, and may disappear after the treatment of the lesion...|$|R

Only three <b>isolated</b> spontaneous <b>seizures</b> were observed during the whole period of observation (120 days). the long-term effects of three consecutive episodes of SE include increased spontaneous exploratory activity, learning impairment, and reduced anxiety when tested on P 60. Our findings provide evidence for EEG changes and cognitive deficits in adult life following recurrent SE on postnatal days 7 - 9. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

50|$|It is {{for this}} reason that most people {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy are prohibited or restricted by their local laws from operating vehicles. However, most places have exceptions built into their laws for those who can prove that they have stabilized their condition.

40|$|Several plant-derived {{essential}} oils {{have been known}} {{for over a century}} to have epileptogenic properties. We report three healthy patients, two adults and one child, who suffered from an <b>isolated</b> generalized tonic-clonic <b>seizure</b> and a generalized tonic status, respectively, related to the absorption of several of these oils for therapeutic purposes. No other cause of epilepsy was found, and outcome was good in the two adult cases, but the course has been less favorable in the child. A survey of the literature shows {{essential oils}} of 11 plants to be powerful convulsants (eucalyptus, fennel, hyssop, pennyroyal, rosemary, sage, savin, tansy, thuja, turpentine, and wormwood) due to their content of highly reactive monoterpene ketones, such as camphor, pinocamphone, thujone, cineole, pulegone, sabinylacetate, and fenchone. Our three cases strongly support the concept of plant-related toxic seizure. Nowadays the wide use of these compounds in certain unconventional medicines makes this severe complication again possible...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: 3 -Methylglutaconic aciduria type I {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of leucine catabolism. It is thought to present in {{childhood}} with nonspecific symptoms; it was even speculated to be a nondisease. The natural course of disease is unknown. METHODS: This is a study on 10 patients with 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria type I. We present the clinical, neuroradiologic, biochemical, and genetic details on 2 new adult-onset patients and follow-up data on 2 patients from the literature. RESULTS: Two unrelated patients with the characteristic biochemical findings of 3 - methylglutaconic aciduria type I presented in adulthood with progressive ataxia. One patient additionally had optic atrophy, the other spasticity and dementia. Three novel mutations were found in conserved regions of the AUH gene. In both patients, MRI revealed extensive white matter disease. Follow-up MRI in a 10 -year-old boy, who presented earlier with <b>isolated</b> febrile <b>seizures,</b> showed mild abnormalities in deep white matter. CONCLUSION: We define 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria type I as an inborn error of metabolism with slowly progressive leukoencephalopathy clinically presenting in adulthood. In contrast to the nonspecific findings in pediatric cases, the clinical and neuroradiologic pattern in adult patients is highly characteristic. White matter abnormalities may already develop in {{the first decades of}} life. The variable features found in affected children may be coincidental. Long-term follow-up in children is essential {{to learn more about the}} natural course of this presumably slowly progressive disease. Dietary treatment with leucine restriction may be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Bone marrow {{mononuclear}} cell (BM-MNC) intra-arterial transplantation improves recovery in experimental models of ischemic stroke. We aimed {{to assess the}} safety, feasibility, and biological effects of autologous BM-MNC transplantation in patients with stroke. Methods—A single-blind (outcomes assessor) controlled Phase I/II trial was conducted in patients with middle cerebral artery stroke. Autologous BM-MNCs were injected intra-arterially between 5 and 9 days after stroke. Follow-up was done for up to 6 months and blood samples were collected for biological markers. The primary outcome was safety and feasibility of the procedure. The secondary outcome was improvement in neurological function. Results—Ten cases (BM-MNC-treated) and 10 control subjects (BM-MNC-nontreated) were consecutively included. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale before the procedure was 15. 6. Mean BM-MNCs injected were 1. 59108. There was no death, stroke recurrence, or tumor formation during follow-up, although 2 cases had an <b>isolate</b> partial <b>seizure</b> at 3 months. After transplantation, higher plasma levels of beta nerve growth factor (-nerve growth factor) were found compared with control subjects (P 0. 02). There {{were no significant differences}} in neurological function at 180 days. A trend to positive correlation between number of CD 34 cells injected and Barthel Index was found (r 0. 56, P 0. 09). Conclusions—Intra-arterial BM-MNC transplantation in subacute ischemic stroke is feasible and seems to be safe. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm the safety and elucidate the efficacy of BM-MNC transplantation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{assess the}} utility of acute {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) performed {{in the emergency room}} (ER) and its impact on subsequent management of patients with new-onset seizures. Adults who recover fully in the ER following suspected <b>isolated</b> new-onset <b>seizures</b> are usually discharged to the neurology clinic for further review. An EEG at that stage may be normal. We sought to assess the feasibility and yield of early EEG in the ER setting, its impact on management. MethodsA prospective study from January 2008 to January 2011 of patients diagnosed by ER physicians with uncomplicated suspected first episodes of unprovoked convulsive seizures. All patients underwent routine 30 -min EEG in the ER prior to discharge and specialist review was arranged in the epilepsy clinic within 2 weeks of presentation. Management decisions were at the discretion of the treating neurologist. Seizure recurrence was assessed during a follow up period between 9 months and 3 years. Results 136 patients were included in the study (92 males). Mean age was 32 years (range 16 – 73). Forty had abnormal EEGs: 16 focal epileptiform discharges, 12 focal slowing, 10 generalized spike-wave discharges and 2 generalized slowing. Using multivariate analysis, those with abnormal EEG (51 % vs 11 %, p= 0. 003) and abnormal MRI (53 % vs 28 %, p< 0. 001) {{were more likely to be}} commenced on anticonvulsant therapy. Abnormal MRI (p= 0. 001) was independently associated with a higher risk of recurrence. ConclusionsFollowing an ER diagnosis of new-onset uncomplicated seizure, early EEG had a high diagnostic yield. Abnormal EEG and abnormal MRI significantly contributed to decision-making regarding treatment at specialist review. Abnormal MRI was associated with significantly higher risks of subsequent seizures...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPurpose:To {{assess the}} {{advantages}} of the 2001 ILAE proposed diagnostic scheme for classification of newborns with epileptic seizures over the 1989 ILAE classification. Method:Clinical features, seizure semiology and duration, neurological evaluation, ictal and interictal EEG, brain imaging and outcome {{at the end of the}} neonatal period (44 weeks post-conceptional age) of 94 newborns with EEG confirmed seizures were analyzed. The 2001 ILAE classification was applied where possible. Results:Twenty patients died before the end of the neonatal period. In the remaining patients, applying axis 3, we classified 54 newborns as having epileptic seizures that do not require a diagnosis of epilepsy; 14 as symptomatic partial epilepsy; 5 within the neonatal epileptic syndromes and one as benign neonatal seizures (NS). Axis 4 in all newborns provided a valuable tool in order to better define the individual patient. Conclusions:Compared to the 1989 ILAE classification, which allowed a syndromic diagnosis in only 6 / 94 patients, the remaining being classified as Epilepsies and Syndromes undetermined whether focal or generalized, the 2001 ILAE diagnostic scheme, applied at the end of the neonatal period, offers a variety of approaches to classification, allowing an early distinction between epilepsy and single or <b>isolated</b> clusters of <b>seizures,</b> with therapeutic and prognostic implications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} seizure recurrence after antiepileptic drugs (AED) withdrawal and to identify related predictive features in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) commencing at developing age (up to 16 year). MethodsMedical records of consecutive patients with IGE from two refferal hospitals were evaluated between 2001 and 2009. Inclusion criteria were clinical and EEG diagnosis of IGE and follow up for at least 2 years after the AED withdrawal. The cohort consisted of 59 patients (38 females, 21 males). Follow up after withdrawal lasted 2 – 10 years (median 3) Time to seizure relapse and predictive factors were analyzed by survival methods. ResultsThere were 21 (35. 6 %) patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), 11 (18. 6 %) with juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), 10 (16. 9 %) with <b>isolated</b> primary GTC <b>seizures,</b> and 17 (28. 8 %) with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The relapses occured in 23 (52. 2 %) patients: one (6. 2 %) with CAE, 4 (50 %) with JAE, 8 (80 %) with IGE with GTC seizures and all with JME. During the first 6 months 54. 5 % patients relapsed (20 % during withdrawal), 63. 6 % within 12 months, 81. 8 % within 18 months and 95. 4 % within 24 months after withdrawal. Female gender, age at onset of seizures, seizure types, EEG worsening during/after AED withdrawal and age at withdrawal {{were significantly associated with}} relapse risk according to univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, retained significant factors were: seizure types and EEG worsening. ConclusionDiagnosis of the specific IGE syndrome strongly affects relapse rate: the lowest was in CAE, the highest in JME. Independent risk factors for seizure relapse were: seizure type and EEG worsening during and/or after withdrawal...|$|R
40|$|Removal of the pineal gland from {{partially}} parathyroidectomized rats produces stereotyped violent seizures. Inasmuch as the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) {{has been}} implicated in this experimental paradigm, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of specific alterations in catecholamine function on convulsions produced by pinealectomy (PinX). Additionally, the role of various pineal substances, sex differences and the caging paradigm in the convulsive response was studied. Male and female rats (grouped five per cage) were found to respond similarly to the convulsive stimulus of parathyroidectomy followed by PinX. Neither implants of melatonin nor ventricular injections of arginine vasotocin in isolated and grouped rats, respectively, produced consistent changes in convulsions from PinX. The method of caging the rats after PinX, however, dramatically influenced <b>seizures.</b> <b>Isolated</b> rats (one per cage) convulsed significantly later after PinX and did so less often than grouped (five per cage) controls. NE neurotransmission appears to play a strong role in influencing PinX-induced seizures. Augmenting NE function with desipramine suppressed seizures. Convulsions were enhanced by the (beta) -receptor antagonist timolol, while neonatal injections of the catecholamine neurotoxin 6 -OHDA potentiated seizures so markedly that many rats died from just one convulsion. NE levels were significantly reduced in the telencephalons and increased in the brain stems of sham-pinealectomized rats which had also received neonatal 6 -OHDA; telencephalic levels of DA were elevated by 6 -OHDA. Both the proconvulsant effects of 6 -OHDA and the alterations it produced in central catecholamine levels were prevented, for the most part, by pretreatment with DMI. Altering both NE and DA function with L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, (alpha) -methyl-p-tyrosine, FLA- 63 or reserpine did not significantly affect PinX-induced <b>seizures</b> in <b>isolated</b> rats. NE appears to play a strong role in modulating PinX-induced seizures; however, a deficit in NE function per se does not seem to be the fundamental cause of the seizures since sham-pinealectomized rats having lowered NE and/or DA function did not convulse...|$|R
