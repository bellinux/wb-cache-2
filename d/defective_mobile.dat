50|$|The {{equipment}} identity register {{is often}} integrated to the HLR. The EIR keeps a list of mobile phones (identified by their IMEI) which are to be banned from the network or monitored. This is designed to allow tracking of stolen mobile phones. In theory all data about all stolen mobile phones should be distributed to all EIRs in the world through a Central EIR. It is clear, however, {{that there are some}} countries where this is not in operation. The EIR data does not have to change in real time, which means that this function can be less distributed than the function of the HLR. The EIR is a database that contains information about the identity of the mobile equipment that prevents calls from stolen, unauthorized or <b>defective</b> <b>mobile</b> stations. Some EIR also have the capability to log Handset attempts and store it in a log file.|$|E
40|$|The cryptic bgl operon of Escherichia coli is {{activated}} by the spontaneous insertion of mobile DNA elements. Screening {{of a collection}} of such mutations revealed insertion of the 1195 -base-pair element IS 5 into various positions both upstream and downstream of the bgl promoter P 0. Activation of the operon was in all cases attributable to enhancement of P 0 activity. Introduction of internal deletions into IS 5 almost completely abolished P 0 enhancement, demonstrating that enhancement is not simply the result of mutational inactivation of some inhibitory sequences. Intact copies of IS 5 in trans restored the enhancing activity of the deletion derivatives. The trans-activator is encoded by IS 5 gene ins 5 A, an essential transposition function. Activation of gene expression by means of interaction of a <b>defective</b> <b>mobile</b> element in cis with functions encoded by a nondefective element in trans has so far been described only for a maize controlling element...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{family of}} conjugative {{plasmids}} from Sulfolobus comprising the active variants pING 1, - 4, and - 6 and the functionally defective variants pING 2 and - 3, which require {{the help of}} an active variant for spreading, has been extensively characterized both functionally and molecularly. In view of the sparse similarity between bacterial and archaeal conjugation and the lack of a practical genetic system for Sulfolobus, we compared the functions and sequences of these variants and the previously described archaeal conjugative plasmid pNOB 8 in order to identify open reading frames (ORFs) and DNA sequences that are involved in conjugative transfer and maintenance of these plasmids in Sulfolobus. The variants pING 4 and - 6 are reproducibly derived from pING 1 in vivo by successive transpositions of an element from the Sulfolobus genome. The small <b>defective</b> but <b>mobile</b> variants pING 2 and - 3, which both lack a cluster of highly conserved ORFs probably involved in plasmid transfer, were shown to be formed in vivo by recombinative deletion of the larger part of the genomes of pING 4 and pING 6, respectively. The efÔ¨Åcient occurrence of these recombination processes is further evidence for the striking plasticity of the Sulfolobus genome...|$|R
