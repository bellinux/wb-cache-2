2500|$|The {{impact of}} {{blogging}} upon {{the mainstream media}} has also been acknowledged by governments. In 2009, {{the presence of the}} American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying [...] "if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up <b>getting</b> <b>is</b> people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”. Between 2009 and 2012, an Orwell Prize for blogging was awarded.|$|E
2500|$|The UK music press warmly {{received}} the album, Nick Kent in the NME confessing [...] "I'd be {{ashamed to say}} I didn't love it" [...] describing the music as one chord short of [...] "the strongest high energy cosmic hubcap {{this side of the}} Metal Zone". Andrew Means of Melody Maker commented that [...] "It's not melody and it's not harmony, and it's not really rhythm... it is ambiguity. It is the spaced out slipstream, the rushing, gurgling torrent of weightless sound that first turns the circle of mental pictures, associations and impressions picked out from space, time and earth... The listener is as much a traveller as the musician." [...] Sounds Martin Hayman meanwhile described the music as [...] "the bass and drums batter on with unflagging pace, synthesisers swirl and whistle around the thunderous block riffs whose endless repetition generates that numbed hypnosis, tuneless and menacing voices incant largely incomprehensible lyrics. This is not to knock Hawkwind: the sound they are <b>getting</b> <b>is</b> thicker, fuller, more convincing than ever before. [...] Its total effect is pretty devastating, but the means by which the effect is achieved is no revolution in sound." ...|$|E

6000|$|Whether {{we like it}} or not, we {{who live}} in this world to-day find we must either devote a {{considerable}} amount of our attention to getting and keeping money, and shape our activities--or, if you will, distort them--with a constant reference to that process, or we must accept futility. Whatever powers men want to exercise, whatever service they wish to do, it is a preliminary condition for most of them that they must, by earning something or selling something, achieve opportunity.

60|$|But to {{give you}} a more direct answer. This kind of <b>getting</b> <b>is</b> so far off from doing them little good, that it doth them no good at all; because thereby they lose their own souls; 'What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' (Mark 8:36). He loseth then, he loseth greatly that getteth after this fashion. This is the man that is penny-wise and pound-foolish; this is he that loseth his good sheep for a half-penny-worth of tar;[52] that loseth a soul for a little of the world. And then what doth he get thereby but loss and damage? Thus he getteth or rather loseth about the world to come. But what doth he get in this world, more than travail and sorrow, vexation of spirit, and disappointment? Men aim at blessedness in getting, I mean, at {{temporal}} blessedness; but the man that thus getteth, shall not have that. For though an inheritance after this manner may be hastily gotten at the beginning, yet the end thereof shall not be blessed. They gather it indeed, and think to keep it too, but what says Solomon? God casteth it away. 'The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; but he casteth away the substance of the wicked' (Prov 10:3; Jer 15:13, 17:3).|$|E
