40|$|It is {{required}} that Di- 2 -ethylhexyl Sebacate oil, also {{commonly known as}} <b>Dioctyl</b> <b>Sebacate</b> oil, be thoroughly removed from certain metals, in this case stainless steel parts with narrow, enclosed spaces. <b>Dioctyl</b> <b>Sebacate</b> oil is a synthetic oil with a low compressibility.

The current method to remove the <b>Dioctyl</b> <b>Sebacate</b> from stainless steel parts with narrow, enclosed spaces is a labor-intensive, multi-step process, including a detergent clean, a deionized (DI) water rinse, and several solvent rinses, to achieve a nonvolatile residue of 0. 04 mg per 50 mL rinse effluent. This study was undertaken to determine a superior detergent/solvent cleaning method for the oil to reduce cleaning time and/or the amount of detergent/solvent used.

Chromatographic traces are presented of volatile fatty acid analyses with each of the liquid phases. Complete separation of all isomers of the fatty acids from C 2 to C 5 was accomplished by the Carbowax 20 M plus H 3 PO 4, <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> plus sebacic acid, and <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> plus docosanoic acid columns. The latter two liquid phases were extremely unstable and proved to be unsatisfactory for analysis of aqueous samples. A column of Carbowax 20 M + H 3 PO 4 separated steam-volatile organic acids completely. The volatile fatty acid isomers were separated by 5 % Tween 80 somewhat less completely, and the peak shapes were not as sharp and symmetrical as that desired for good quantitative work.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of aerosol absorption on direct radiative forcing {{is still an}} active area of research, in part, because aerosol extinction is dominated by light scattering and, in part, because the primary absorbing aerosol of interest, soot, exhibits complex aging behavior that alters its optical properties. The consequences {{of this can be}} evidenced by the work of Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) who suggest that incorporating the atmospheric heating due to brown clouds (plumes containing soot byproducts from automobiles, biomass burning, wood-burning kitchen stoves, and coal-fired power plants) will increase black carbon (BC) radiative forcing from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change best estimate of 0. 34 Wm- 2 (± 0. 25 Wm- 2) (IPCC 2007) to 0. 9 Wm- 2. This noteworthy degree of uncertainty is due largely to the interdependence of BC optical properties on particle mixing state and aggregate morphology, each of which changes as the particle ages in the atmosphere and becomes encapsulated within a coating of inorganic and/or organic substances. In July 2008, a laboratory-based measurement campaign, led by Boston College and Aerodyne, was initiated to begin addressing this interdependence. To achieve insights into the interdependence of BC optical properties on particle mixing state and aggregate morphology, measurements of both the optical and physical properties of flame-generated soot under nascent, coated, and denuded conditions were conducted. This poster presents data on black carbon (BC) light absorption measured by Photothermal Interferometry (Sedlacek and Lee 2007). In addition to examining nascent BC—to provide a baseline measurement—encapsulation with varying thicknesses of either <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DOS) or sulfuric acid was conducted to glean insights into the interplay between particle mixing state and optical properties. Additionally, some experiments were carried out where BC was coated and then denuded. In the case of DOS-coated soot, a monotonic increase in light absorption to nearly 100 % is observed as a function of DOS coating thickness. This observation is consistent with a coating-induced amplification in particle light absorption (Bond et al. 2006). In contrast, light absorption by sulfuric acid-coated soot displays unexpectedly complex behavior where the degree of amplification appears to be dependent upon the underlying soot core diameter...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the miniature Versatile Aerosol Concentration Enrichment System (m-VACES; Geller et al., 2005) was investigated in laboratory and field studies using online instruments. Laboratory tests focused {{on the behavior of}} monodisperse ammonium sulfate (AS) or <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DOS) particles in the m-VACES measured with the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The ambient measurements were conducted at an urban site in Helsinki, Finland, where the operation of the m-VACES was explored in conjunction with a Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) in addition to the SMPS. In laboratory tests, the growth of particles in water vapor produced a stable droplet size distribution independent of the original particle size. However, when the droplets were dried with the goal of measuring the original size distribution, a shift to larger particles was observed for small particle sizes (up to ~ 200 nm in mobility diameter). That growth was probably caused by water-soluble organic compounds absorbed on the water droplets from the gas phase, but not evaporated in the drying phase. In ambient measurements, a similar enrichment was observed for nitrate and sulfate in the m-VACES whereas the presence of acidic ambient particles affected the enrichment of ammonium. Gaseous ammonia was likely to be absorbed on acidic particles in the m-VACES, neutralizing the aerosol. For organics, the enrichment efficiency was comparable with sulfate and nitrate but a small positive artifact for hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing organic compounds was noticed. Ambient and concentrated organic aerosol (OA) was analyzed further with positive matrix factorization (PMF). A three-factor solution was chosen for both of the data sets but the factors were slightly different for the ambient and concentrated OA, however, the data set used for the PMF analysis was limited in size (3 days) and therefore had substantial uncertainty. Overall, the operation of the m-VACES was not found to lead to any severe sampling artifacts. The effect of acidity could be an issue in locations where the aerosol is acidic, however, in those cases the use of a denuder (which was not used in this study) is recommended. Further ambient tests are needed for the characterization of the m-VACES as the time period for the ambient measurements was only 5 days in this study.

40|$|International audienceDirect Analysis in Real Time (DART™) {{high-resolution}} Orbitrap™ {{mass spectrometry}} (HRMS) {{in combination with}} Raman microscopy {{was used for the}} detailed molecular level characterization of explosives including not only the charge but also the complex matrix of binders, plasticizers, polymers, and other possible organic additives. A total of 15 defused military weapons including grenades, mines, rockets, submunitions, and mortars were examined. Swabs and wipes were used to collect trace (residual) amounts of explosives and their organic constituents from the defused military weapons and micrometer-size explosive particles were transferred using a vacuum suction-impact collection device (vacuum impactor) from wipe and swap samples to an impaction plate made of carbon. The particles deposited on the carbon plate were then characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy followed by DART-HRMS providing fingerprint signatures of orthogonal nature. The optical microscope of the micro-Raman spectrometer was first used to localize and characterize the explosive charge on the impaction plate which was then targeted for identification by DART-HRMS analysis in both the negative and positive modes. Raman spectra of the explosives TNT, RDX and PETN were acquired from micrometer size particles and characterized by the presence of their characteristic Raman bands obtained directly at the surface of the impaction plate nondestructively without further sample preparation. Negative mode DART-HRMS confirmed the types of charges contained in the weapons (mainly TNT, RDX, HMX, and PETN; either as individual components or as mixtures). These energetic compounds were mainly detected as deprotonated species [M–H] −, or as adduct [M + 35 Cl] −, [M + 37 Cl] −, or [M + NO 3] − anions. Chloride adducts were promoted in the heated DART reagent gas by adding chloro-form vapors to the helium stream using an Bin-house^ delivery method. When the polarity was switched to positive mode, DART-HRMS revealed a very complex distribution of poly-meric binders (mainly polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols), plasticizers (e. g., <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> tributyl phosphate), as well as wax-like compounds whose structural features could not be precisely assigned. In positive mode, compounds were identified either as protonated molecules or am-monium adduct species. These results clearly demonstrate the complementarity of micro-Raman microscopy combined with DART-MS. The former technique provides structural information on the type of explosives present at the surface of the sample, whereas the latter provides not only a confirmation {{of the nature of the}} explosive charge but also useful additional information regarding the nature of the complex organic matrix of binders, plasticizers, polymers, oils, and potentially other organic additives and contaminants present in the sample. Combining these two techniques provides a powerful tool for the screening, comprehensive characterization, and differentiation of particulate explosive samples for forensic sciences and homeland security applications...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{aerosols}} are ubiquitous to {{the lower}} atmosphere and there is growing concern about their impact on climate and human health. These aerosols typically have multicomponent compositions that change over time {{in part due to}} oxidation by reactive trace gases, such as ozone. A current challenge to the atmospheric research community is to develop better methods of analysis of these particles. Photoelectron resonance capture ionization aerosol mass spectrometry (PERCI-AMS) is an online mass spectrometric method that has been applied to the analysis of organic aerosols. One of its key advantages is that it employs low energy (~ 0 eV) photoelectrons in the ion forming process, which has been shown to minimize fragmentation in the organic analytes, thus simplifying mass spectral interpretation. This dissertation focuses on the application of PERCI-AMS to the analysis of organic particles. Initial emphasis is placed on the heterogeneous reaction of gas phase ozone with liquid oleic acid particles. Products identified included carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and peroxides including alpha-acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides polymers. The evidence of peroxidic products suggested the stabilization of carbonyl oxide intermediates (i. e. Criegee intermediates) that are formed during ozonolysis. Subsequent PERCI-AMS experiments investigated the reactivity of the stabilized Criegee intermediates. This included investigating the reaction of Criegee intermediates with unsaturated fatty acids and methyl esters. A novel ketone-forming reaction is described in these systems, suggesting the Criegee intermediates can react at a carbon-carbon double bond. Further PERCI-AMS experiments investigated the oxidative processing of particulate amines including octadecylamine and hexadecylamine. Ozonolysis of these amines resulted in strong NO 2 - and NO 3 - ion signals that increased with the ozone exposure and suggested a mechanism of progressive oxidation. Additionally, a strong ion signal was detected for NO 3 -(HNO 3), which is the ion core of the most important ion cluster series in the troposphere, NO 3 -(HNO 3) n(H 2 O) m. PERCI-AMS was applied to the analysis of ozonized mixed particles of amines with oleic acid or <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate.</b> In the ozonolysis of the amines with oleic acid, products included imines and amides. The routes to the amides were shown to most likely arise from the reactivity of stabilized Criegee intermediates and/or secondary ozonides with the amines. There was also direct evidence of the formation of a surface barrier in the octadecylamine and oleic acid reaction system, which resulted in the retention of oleic acid at high ozone exposures. These experiments have fostered {{a better understanding of the}} analytical capacity of PERCI-AMS in assaying the reactivity of organic aerosols as well as giving a more accurate description of the heterogeneous chemistry of these challenging reaction systems. Suggestions for adaptations to PERCI-AMS and future experiments o...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} and applied novel experimental techniques for determination of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of semi-volatile organic aerosols. The thermodynamic properties investigated were the saturation pressure, {{enthalpy of vaporization}} and activity coefficient, and the kinetic property was the evaporation coefficient. The thermodynamic properties were determined using the integrated volume method (IVM), which relies on measurements of aerosol particle concentrations at different thermodynamic equilibrium states. The measured decrease in particle concentration upon heating in a flow tube, a thermodenuder, can be correlated with saturation pressure and enthalpy of vaporization via the IVM equation, which was derived from fundamental principles, namely the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, mass conservation, and ideal gas law. The main advantage of the IVM over other methods {{reported in the literature}} is that the other methods use kinetic-based techniques to measure thermodynamic properties which requires assumptions on the usually unknown evaporation coefficient; the IVM, on the other hand, is equilibrium-based and thus requires no assumption on the evaporation coefficient. We have applied the IVM to C- 4, - 6, - 7, and - 9 dicarboxylic acid aerosols, which are pertinent to atmospheric secondary organic aerosols. Saturation pressure and enthalpy of vaporization values obtained for these compounds were respectively 3. 7 E- 4 Pa and 88 kJ/mol, 3. 4 E- 5 Pa and 135 kJ/mol, 7. 2 E- 5 Pa and 149 kJ/mol, and 1. 4 E- 5 Pa and 145 kJ/mol. The IVM was also used to determine activity coefficients of individual compounds in binary mixtures as a function of their mole fractions. We demonstrated this method using the following four model systems. System 1 : adipic acid - pimelic acid, which illustrated polar organic - polar organic interactions. Non-ideal behavior was observed with activity coefficients around three at infinite dilution. System 2 : adipic acid - <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> which illustrated polar organic - non-polar organic interactions. The compounds in this experiment did not form a solution. System 3 : adipic acid - ammonium sulfate, which illustrates polar organic - inorganic interactions. The compounds in this experiment did not form a solution. System 4 : adipic acid - ambient extracts, which illustrated the potential use of the method to study partitioning behavior of individual components in a complex matrix approximating that of real ambient aerosol. The measured activity coefficient of adipic acid was less than unity for the tested range of mixing ratios, indicating suppression of volatility of this compound in ambient organic matrix. We have investigated three controversial issues associated with the IVM as well as other methods which utilize thermodenuders and/or aerosol generation by spray atomization and drying: 1) equilibration time scales in thermodenuders, 2) the need of an activated carbon (AC) denuder in the cooling section, and 3) the effect of residual solvent on measured thermodynamic properties of aerosols generated by spray atomization and drying. Both numerical simulations and experiments showed that the aerosols approached equilibrium within reasonable residence times (15 s - 30 s) for aerosol size distributions typical for laboratory measurements. We have also performed dimensional analysis on the problem of equilibration in TDs, and derived a dimensionless equilibration parameter which can be used to determine the residence time needed for an aerosol of given sized distribution and kinetic properties to approach equilibrium. Using both model simulations and experiments, we have shown that with aerosol size distributions relevant to both ambient and laboratory measurements re-condensation in the cooling section, with and without an AC denuder, was negligible. Thus, there is no significant benefit in using an AC denuder in the cooling section. To investigate the effect of residual solvent on measured thermodynamic properties, we compared measurements of saturation pressure and enthalpy of vaporization of C- 6 (adipic) and C- 9 (azelaic) dicarboxylic acid aerosols generated by atomization of aqueous solutions to those generated by homogeneous condensation using a modified Sinclair - La Mer generator. We found no statistically significant difference between the tested aerosol generation methods, indicating that residual solvent carried by the particles had no impact on the measurements. To determine the evaporation coefficient, we developed the integrated volume - tandem differential mobility analysis (IV-TDMA) method. This thermodenuder-based method allows separate determination of the three parameters governing aerosol evaporation, namely, saturation pressure, surface free energy, and evaporation coefficient. Saturation pressure was determined using the IVM, while evaporation coefficient and surface free energy were determined by fitting particle evaporation rates measured under non-equilibrium conditions to a numerical model of the evaporation process. Evaporation coefficient was determined in a size range where surface free energy effects were negligible, allowing for single parameter optimization. We obtained evaporation coefficient and surface free energy values of 0. 07 and 0. 15 J/m 2, 0. 08 and 0. 17 J/m 2 and 0. 24 and 0. 23 J/m 2 for C- 4, - 6, and - 7 dicarboxylic acids, respectively.

Pui. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 201 pages, appendix p. 198 - 201. To force {{the development and}} use of the best available emission technologies needed to significantly reduce Diesel particulate matter (DPM) mass, the 2007 United States Environmental Protection Agency DPM standards for on-road trucks were reduced by 90 % to 0. 01 g/hp-hr. On-road Diesel engines manufactured after 2007 emit low levels of DPM. The gravimetric method used for certification differentiates between compliant and noncompliant engines at the 0. 01 g/hp-hr level. At concentrations below ~ 10 µg/m 3 the method lacks sensitivity, making it difficult to evaluate alternative engine designs, emission control devices, alternative fuels, and modified lubricants that reduce DPM even further. Alternative methods and metrics like the particle size and number concentration measurements extend this lower limit of detection and may enable engine manufacturers and others to make better decisions on what future technologies are required for meeting a zero emission goal. The objectives of this research are to improve the understanding of variables like dilution and sampling conditions that contribute to particle-based emission measurements, to identify and improve current and emerging methods, and to use alternative methods to make measurements of engine exhaust to further elucidate the impact of fuels, emission control and engine state-of-maintenance on emissions. Additional background information is found in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 is a synthesis and evaluation of ideas and perspectives that were presented at a series of workshops sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council that aimed to evaluate the current and future status of DPM measurement. Measurement of DPM is a complex issue with many stakeholders, including air quality management and enforcement agencies, engine manufacturers, health experts, and climatologists. Adoption of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007 heavy-duty engine DPM standards posed a unique challenge to engine manufacturers. The new standards reduced DPM emissions to the point that improvements to the gravimetric method were required to increase the accuracy and the sensitivity of the measurement. Despite these improvements, the method still has shortcomings. The objectives of this chapter are to review the physical and chemical properties of DPM that make gravimetric measurement difficult at very low concentrations and to review alternative metrics and methods that are potentially more accurate, sensitive, and specific. Particle volatility, size, surface area, and number metrics and methods to quantify them are considered. Although an alternative method is required {{to meet the needs of}} engine manufacturers, the methods reviewed are applicable to other areas where the gravimetric method detection limit is approached and greater accuracy and sensitivity are required. The review suggests that a method to measure active surface area, combined with a method to separate semi-volatile and solid fractions to further increase the specificity of the measurement, has potential for reducing the lower detection limit of DPM and enabling engine manufacturers to reduce DPM emissions in the future. Chapter 3 improves the understanding of variables like dilution and sampling conditions that contribute to particle-based emission measurements by assessing and comparing the nucleation tendency of Diesel aerosols when diluted with a porous wall dilutor or an air ejector in a laboratory setting. A de facto standard air-ejector dilutor and typical dilution conditions were used to establish the baseline sensitivity to dilution conditions for the given engine operating condition. A porous tube dilutor was designed and special attention was given to integrating the dilutor with the exhaust pipe and residence time chamber. Results from this system were compared with the ejector dilutor. Exhaust aerosols were generated by a Deere 4045 Diesel engine running at low speed (1400 rpm) and low load (50 Nm, ~ 10 % of rated). Primary dilution parameters that were varied included dilution air temperature (25 and 47 °C) and dilution ratio (5, 14, and 55). Particle measurements were made at 0. 3, 0. 75, and 1. 0 s to evaluate particle growth in the residence time chamber. Exhaust size distribution measurements made using the ejector dilutor were bimodal with high concentrations of nucleation mode particles. Varying the dilution ratio from 5 to 55 : 1 (with a dilution air temperature of 25 ºC and residence time of 1 s) caused the greatest change in the particle number concentration (4 x 108 to 4 x 1010 particles/cm 3) compared to changes in the other variables. Particle concentration was lower with higher dilution air temperatures and particles were larger in size. Size distributions downstream of the porous tube and ejector dilutor were qualitatively similar in shape. Using a simple dilution model and equations for particle growth in the free molecular regime, particle growth in the two residence time chambers was compared. Model results suggest that dilution in the porous tube dilution system occurs more slowly than in the ejector dilutor. This is consistent with the findings that the particle number concentrations were consistently higher and the geometric mean diameter was generally 1 to 5 nm larger downstream of the porous tube dilutor. Chapter 4 describes the comparison of two methods that are used to separate the solid and volatile components of an aerosol: the thermal denuder (TD) and catalytic stripper (CS). The TD and CS were challenged with atmospheric and laboratory generated aerosols. Laboratory generated particles were composed of tetracosane, tetracosane and sulfuric acid, and <b>dioctyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> and sulfuric acid. These compositions were chosen because they roughly simulate the composition of nanoparticles found in Diesel exhaust The TD method produced semi-volatile particle artifacts due to the incomplete removal of evaporated compounds that nucleated and formed particles and solid particle artifacts that formed during treatment of the aerosol by the TD. Fundamental differences in the performance of the two methods lead to different conclusions regarding the presence or absence, size, and concentration of solid particles in Diesel exhaust. In Chapter 5 the physical and chemical nature of the engine exhaust from a Formula SAE spark ignition engine was evaluated using two competition fuels, 100 octane race fuel and E 85. Three engine conditions were evaluated: 6000 RPM 75 % throttle, 8000 RPM 50 % throttle, and 8000 RPM 100 % throttle. Diluted emissions were characterized using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC). E 85 fuel produced more power and produced less particulate matter emissions at all test conditions, but more fuel was consumed. Chapter 6 demonstrates how exhaust aerosol measurements can be used to diagnose an engine fault in a Diesel engine. A cyclic variation in total particle number concentration was observed while making routine exhaust emission measurements. Many dilution and engine operating conditions were examined and by sequentially shutting down individual cylinders the problem was traced to cylinder 2. The engine was disassembled and piston 2 ’s oil control ring was found to be fractured. Replacement of the ring eliminated the particle concentration fluctuation. This chapter presents the results of experimental measurements made to determine the cause of the irregular emissions. Chapter 7 describes the results of three experiments performed with Continuously Regenerating Traps (CRTs) in a controlled laboratory setting to elucidate the effects of fuel sulfur content, filter age, and storage and release effects on particle concentration. In the first experiment, a new CRT was evaluated using near zero sulfur Fischer Tropsch fuel and low sulfur lubricating oil (420 ppm). The objective was to measure particle emissions from an emission control device that had not previously been exposed to sulfur under a variety of operating and dilution conditions. Next, a used CRT was evaluated using the same fuel and lubricating oil. Finally, the used uncatalyzed Diesel particulate filter (DPF) from the used CRT was replaced with a new, uncatalyzed DPF. The emissions from the used Diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) + new DPF configuration were evaluated and compared to those of the used CRT. Results show that particle number emissions from the new CRTs are 99. 9 % lower than equivalent used CRT data collected on-road at an exhaust temperature of 370 °C. Even as the new CRT temperature was increased to almost 400 °C, emissions levels were still at background levels for roadway aerosol and no nucleation mode was observed. At an exhaust temperature of about 380 °C, the nucleation mode particle number concentration increased sharply and remained high for the duration of the used CRT test. Mass emissions were estimated and found to exceed U. S. EPA on-road standards. The particle number concentration at the start of the used DOC + new DPF evaluation was equal to that measured at the end of the used CRT experiment, suggesting that only sulfates released from the DOC and not the uncatalyzed DPF significantly contribute to nanoparticle formation.
