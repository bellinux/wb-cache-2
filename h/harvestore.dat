50|$|While {{the iconic}} blue <b>Harvestore</b> low-oxygen silos were once very common, {{the speed of}} its {{unloader}} mechanism {{was not able to}} match the output rates of modern bunker silos, and this type of silo went into decline. Unloader repair expenses also severely hurt the <b>Harvestore</b> reputation, because the unloader feed mechanism is located {{in the bottom of the}} silo under tons of silage. In the event of cutter chain breakage, it can cost up to US$10,000 to perform repairs. The silo may need to be partially or completely emptied by alternate means, to unbury the broken unloader retrieve broken components lost in the silage at the bottom of the structure.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 the <b>Harvestore</b> company {{recognized}} {{these issues}} and worked to develop new unloaders with double the flow rate of previous models to stay competitive with bunkers, and with far greater unloader chain strength. They are now also using load sensing soft-start variable frequency drive motor controllers to {{reduce the likelihood of}} mechanism breakage, and to control the feeder sweep arm movement.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Sawyer Electric of Los Angeles, California, {{a manufacturer of}} electric motors. In 1942, it once again began to produce bomb casings, as well as aircraft propellers, undercarriages, torpedoes, and air flasks. By 1945, the company had built 4.5 million bombs, 16,750 sets of landing gear, and 46,700 propeller blades. They also built nose frames for the B-25 bomber, water heaters, jeep frames, and components for the atomic bomb project. In 1946, they built a 400,000 square foot residential water heater plant in Kankakee, Illinois. In 1948, they entered the commercial water heater market after acquiring The Burkay Company of Toledo, Ohio. In 1949, the company began producing <b>Harvestore,</b> a glass-fused-to-steel silo, targeted at dairy and livestock operations. In the 1950s, A. O. Smith acquired Whirl-A-Way Motors of Dayton, Ohio, and consolidated its electric motor manufacturing operations there. The motor division later introduced the hermetic motor, {{a critical component of}} air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Its water heater division introduced the first glass-lined commercial water heater, the A. O. Smith Burkay B-65, and later the company established a glass fiber division to replace steel in many applications. It also expanded into supplying oil field pipe and pipe for service stations, eventually becoming Smith Fiberglass Products in 1986.|$|E
40|$|Dry corn (dry), <b>Harvestore</b> ensiled high-moisture corn, {{stave silo}} ensiled high-moisture corn (stave H. M. C.) and stave H. M. C. ensiled with NaOH, Cold-flo ammonia, or Silo-Best {{additives}} were evaluated in steer and heifer finishing trials. Cold-flo and NaOH H. M. C. gave slowest gains; NaOH {{had the highest}} intake and <b>Harvestore</b> H. M. C. the lowest, efficiency of gain favored the <b>Harvestore</b> H. M. C. All H. M. C. corn except NaOH was unstable in air because of high dry matter at ensiling, slow corn use, and warm temperatures. Dry matter losses and temperature rises during air exposure were highest for Cold-flo and <b>Harvestore</b> H. M. C...|$|E
40|$|Dry corn, stave ensiled high-moisture corn (HMC), stave ensiled HMC {{treated with}} urea, and <b>Harvestore</b> ensiled HMC were {{evaluated}} in a steer finishing trial. Alfalfa hay and corn silage were the roughages and soybean meal or urea, the nitrogen sources. There {{were no differences}} in steer performance for corn treatments, but steer performance was significantly improved when alfalfa hay rather than corn silage was the roughage. Urea supplements significantly depressed steer performance compared with soybean meal additions; a combination of urea and soybean meal gave intermediate performance...|$|E
