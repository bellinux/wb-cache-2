The KSBI contract also included rights to air half-hour pregame and postgame shows, various team-related programs (including the magazine show Thunder Weekly), and overnight/early morning rebroadcasts of each televised game. The station's broadcast relationship with the Thunder ended on August 3, 2010, after the team signed an exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma starting with the 2010-11 season. On May 10, 2012, KSBI began broadcasting Texas Rangers Major League Baseball games on Friday evenings, produced by KTXA-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth; these games moved to KSBI's 52.2 subchannel in 2013, before being discontinued after the subchannel was decommissioned following the takeover of KSBI's operations by Griffin (the Rangers subsequently signed a 20-year television contract with Fox Sports Southwest, which already simulcast its Rangers telecasts through its Fox Sports Oklahoma subfeed, which gave the regional sports network exclusive rights to Rangers games not aired by <b>ESPN,</b> <b>TBS,</b> Fox or Fox Sports 1).|$|E
