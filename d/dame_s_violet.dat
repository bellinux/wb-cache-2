40|$|Background. Relatively long {{duration}} retinal {{light exposure}} elicits nonvisual responses in humans, including modulation of alertness and cognition. These responses {{are thought to}} be mediated in part by melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells which are more sensitive to blue light than violet or green light. The contribution of the melanopsin system and the brain mechanisms involved in the establishment of such responses to light remain to be established. Methodology/Principal Findings. We exposed 15 participants to short duration (50 <b>s)</b> monochromatic <b>violet</b> (430 nm), blue (473 nm), and green (527 nm) light exposures of equal photon flux (10 13 ph/cm 2 /s) while they were performing a working memory task in fMRI. At light onset, blue light, as compared to green light, increased activity in the left hippocampus, left thalamus, and right amygdala. During the task, blue light, as compared to violet light, increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus, left thalamus and a bilateral area of the brainstem consistent with activation of the locus coeruleus. Conclusion/Significance. These results support a prominent contribution of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells to brain responses to light within the very first seconds of an exposure. The results also demonstrate the implication of the brainstem in mediating these responses in humans and speak for a broad involvement of light in the regulation of brain function...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{functional}} {{interpretations of}} left anterior negativities (LANs), a language-related electroencephalogram effect {{that has been}} found for syntactic and morphological violations. We focus on three possible interpretations of LANs caused by the replacement of irregular affixes with regular affixes: misapplication of morphological rules, mismatch of the presented form with analogy-based expectations, and mismatch of the presented form with stored representations. Event-related brain potentials were recorded during the visual presentation of existing and novel Dutch compounds. Existing compounds contained correct or replaced interfixes (<b>dame</b> + <b>s</b> + salons > damessalons vs. *dame + n + salons > *damensalons ‘‘women’s hairdresser salons’’), whereas novel Dutch compounds contained interfixes that were either supported or not supported by analogy to similar existing compounds (kruidenkelken vs. ?kruidskelken ‘‘herb chalices’’); earlier studies had shown that interfixes are selected by analogy instead of rules. All compounds were presented with correct or incorrect regular plural suffixes (damessalons vs. *damessalonnen). Replacing suffixes or interfixes in existing compounds both led to increased (L) ANs between 400 and 700 msec without any evidence for different scalp distributions for interfixes and suffixes. There was no evidence for a negativity when manipulating the analogical support for interfixes in novel compounds. Together with earlier studies, {{these results suggest that}} LANs had been caused by the mismatch of the presented forms with stored forms.

Notre Dame's preparatory school existed 20 years before the college. In response to the high school graduates' requests in the early 1880s, the School Sisters of Notre Dame expanded Notre Dame of Maryland's curriculum with two years of post-secondary education. This led to the charter of the college on April 2, 1896. Although the school has always been for girls, in the early 1900s, boys were admitted. The sisters began to admit them, it is believed, at the urging of Cardinal James Gibbons for the convenience of some Baltimore families. In more than one school catalogue, the sisters assigned girls' names to the boys. In another, they penciled in [...] "B" [...] above each boy's name. By the late 1920s, however, the school was once again all-female.In an attempt to distinguish the prep school from the College of Notre Dame of Maryland (now Notre Dame of Maryland University) and to meet the growing demand for classroom space, the school moved in 1960 to the current Hampton Lame campus in Towson, Maryland.|$|R

Over {{the next couple}} of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), proposed the erroneous notion that peridioles were ejected from the fruit bodies by some sort of spring mechanism. The genus was established in 1768 by the Swiss scientist Albrecht von Haller; the generic name Cyathus is Latin, but originally derived from the Ancient Greek word κύαθος, meaning [...] "cup". The structure and biology of the genus Cyathus was better known by the mid-19th century, starting with the appearance in 1842 of a paper by Carl Johann Friedrich Schmitz, and two years later, a monograph by the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne.

40|$|AbstractTo {{test whether}} the {{binocular}} contour rivalry mechanism is tritanopic, we presented isoluminant, rival stimuli visible only via the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones. We stimulated only the <b>S</b> cones with <b>violet</b> gratings superimposed {{on a bright}} yellow field that adapted {{the responses of the}} middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive (M and L) cones. We found that an S-cone grating presented to one eye rivalled with an orthogonal grating presented to the other. Rivalry persisted over a range of luminances and contrasts of the S-cone stimuli, and was greater than could be accounted for by nonrival fading. The spatial spread of rivalry from S-cone stimuli is similar to that for the same stimuli when visible also to the M and L cones (luminance stimuli). We found that an S-cone stimulus would rival with a luminance stimulus, and exploited this to determine the equivalent luminance contrast of S-cone stimuli by putting them in a rivalry competition with luminance stimuli. For rivalry, the equivalent luminance contrast of isoluminant, S-cone stimuli is much less than their S-cone contrast. The existence of rivalry with isoluminant stimuli, along with earlier evidence that such stimuli can support stereopsis, challenges the view that an achromatic channel alone drives certain higher level functions such as depth perception...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Skin {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} cancer in humans, with an annual incidence of 5. 4 million in the U. <b>S.</b> Ultra <b>Violet</b> (UV) irradiation generates DNA lesions that are potentially mutagenic, and accumulation of mutations eventually leads to skin cancers. UV irradiation generates two major types of DNA lesions: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6 - 4 photoproducts (6 - 4 PPs) that can cause replication stalling. To cope with the replication-blocking lesions, cells employ a specialized damage tolerance process known as translesion synthesis (TLS), that is potentially mutagenic. The two types of UV lesions are structurally distinct and are bypassed by DNA polymerases differently. Importantly, 6 - 4 PP is more mutagenic than CPD. A major cell cycle checkpoint kinase known as Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated and RAD 3 -related (ATR) is activated after UV. ATR is critical for the cells to survive UV damage, but could also {{increase the risk of}} mutations by increasing the survival of DNA-damaged cells. ATR inhibition augments the apoptosis of UV-damaged cells, thereby suppressing UV carcinogenesis. However, whether ATR promotes mutations in UV-damaged cells remains unclear. It is of interest to investigate whether ATR inhibition reduces mutations in cells surviving UV damage. We hypothesized that ATR is required for promoting error-prone TLS. TLS bypass of 6 - 4 PP lesions increases mutations leading to UV-induced carcinogenesis. In this study, we analyzed the effect of ATR inhibition in TLS activity at 6 - 4 PP lesions. We measured the percentage of unbypassed 6 - 4 PP lesions surrounded by single-stranded DNA by using a lesion-specific antibody using flow cytometry. If ATR is facilitating 6 - 4 PP bypass, ATR inhibition is expected {{to increase the number of}} unbypassed 6 - 4 PP lesions. Our results showed that the percentage of unbypassed 6 - 4 PP lesions were increased when ATR is inhibited by pharmacologic inhibition (VE- 821 /caffeine) compared to cells without ATR inhibition. This implies that ATR is likely involved in 6 - 4 PP lesion bypass. The unbypassed 6 - 4 PP lesions might eventually get repaired or progress into double-strand DNA breaks leading to apoptosis. Therefore, blocking error-prone TLS activity by ATR inhibition using VE- 821 or caffeine might reduce mutation incorporation and thereby suppression of UV carcinogenesis...|$|R

Second, after discussing issues concerning the proper relation between lin-g&tic theories and processing models, a condition on a syntactic level (S-struc-ture) in linguistic theory (Chomsky, 1981) is proposed, to account. for agram-matic data from all the languages considered.

We got to know students from the Sydney Campus and overall it was a great week of sport and fun,” said Ms Paige. The Sydney Netball team were equally impressive with a win - loss record of 5 - 3 and finishing 13 th in the same division. This was the fifth consecutive appearance of a Notre <b>Dame</b> Rugby 7 <b>s</b> team at the AUGs. They put in a brave performance finishing 4 th over all after losing a ‘tight battle’ against Macquarie University in the bronze medal match. Manager of the Student Life Office, Dave McLean, said all the students participating in the games really enjoyed playing sport for Notre Dame and getting to know students from different campuses. “One of the highlights of the week was the unity displayed between students from the Sydney and Fremantle campuses. Despite studying on opposite sides of the country, the camaraderie shown between the students made it seem as though they were from the same classroom. “It was a fantastic week and all students are to be congratulated for their superb performances on the field and the sportsmanship displayed throughout,” said Mr McLean.
