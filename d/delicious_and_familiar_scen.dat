40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 32). The {{primary objective}} of Enriched {{is to create}} a body of work that will thematically represent the relationship between two significant elements in my life: food and ornamentation. The focus of Enriched is presenting the methodology of creating a series of jewelry pieces portraying specific foods that individually represent different moments in both my childhood and contemporary adulthood. This work specifically explores the dichotomy between the traditional values of wearable adornment and its connection to more personal and priceless values. Enriched is comprised of ten jewelry pieces based on the desire to hold on to personal memories and how they are associated with food experiences. My process begins by choosing the most appropriate food for each jewelry piece. Food selected represents the <b>delicious</b> surfaces <b>and</b> <b>familiar</b> color palettes reminiscent of chosen comfort foods. When confronted with the work, I hope to provoke a visceral reaction that connects the viewer to their own food memories. Furthermore, I am interested in how my work can represent the social connection to the remnants as a result of eating those foods. The resulting art pieces were displayed on small tables that resembled traditional T. V. trays with folding metal legs and painted white in order to highlight the artwork. Since each piece was designed to represent a particular moment in my life, they were each shown on individual surfaces. The displays were the same size and color to present the art pieces as a cohesive body of work. The trays were organized in a slight curve to lead the viewers along the same path they might take at a party with a buffet style dinner. The body of work that comprised Enriched was exhibited in the Flor y Canto Gallery at San Diego State University. The work was shown from April 6 through April 11, 2012. Images of Enriched are available for viewing in the Advising Office of San Diego State University's School of Art, Design, and Art History...|$|R
