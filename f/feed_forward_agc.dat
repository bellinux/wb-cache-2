Furthermore, both decimation in frequency (DIF) and decimation in time (DIT) decompositions can be used. In addition to this, the designs can achieve very high throughputs, which makes them suitable for the most demanding applications. Indeed, the proposed radix- 2 k <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> architectures require fewer hardware resources than parallel feedback ones, also called multi-path delay feedback (MDF), when several samples in parallel must be processed. As a result, the proposed radix- 2 k <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> architectures not only offer an attractive solution for current applications, but also open up a new research line on <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> structures by implemetanting the radix which is highly reducing the complexity...|$|R

In this strategy, the effects of disturbances on controlled process variables are inferred from the uncontrolled process variables (direct measurements of disturbances are not needed).

They can be time-consuming to train and require significant parameter tuning. Decision trees are generally faster and simpler to train, but are widely assumed to not offer predictive accuracy as good as <b>feed</b> <b>forward,</b> {{back propagation}} neural networks. We have noticed in previous work that decision trees tended to outperform <b>feed</b> <b>forward,</b> back propagation neural networks on a certain dataset. We provide a description of a class of problems that are extremely difficult for <b>feed</b> <b>forward,</b> back propagation neural networks but relatively simple for Decision trees.

The proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage control scheme considers both the DC voltage error between the reference and measured values, and the AC current from the WPP collector system ensuring fast and robust FRT. The PHIL tests show that the proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage control scheme can fast and efficiently reduce the WPP collection system voltage when there is a voltage dip in the host power system and the wind turbines within the WPP can be triggered into the FRT model, and reduce active power and supply reactive power. As such, the proposed <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> DC voltage can successfully enable the VSC HVDC connected WPP ride through faults in the host power systems.|$|R

30|$|Radial basis {{function}} {{neural networks}} are trained with supervised learning algorithms {{and can be}} perceived as improvements of the multilayer <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> back propagation networks. Many of their characteristic features {{are similar to those}} of <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> neural networks because they perform linear representations and weights summations. However, the transformations performed are local, resulting in their much faster training. Radial basis networks may require more neurons than standard <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> networks, but often they can be designed to take a fraction of time it takes to train standard <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> networks. It is proven that RBFs with one hidden layer can approximate any function; as a result they are called universal approximators. Perceptrons also have the capability of universal approximation but only RBFs possess the ability of optimum approximation. Even if structurally they are less complicated than <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> back propagation networks they can achieve better arbitrary functions approximations with only one hidden layer. Also, it has been observed that they work best when many training vectors are available. When for every input which must be classified there is a basis function Φ(‖x − y‖) the network will give a function, adaptive to every pattern.|$|R

An experimental SCR test apparatus installed on a slipstream of a Coo-per-Bessemer GMV- 4, 2 -stroke cycle {{natural gas engine}} is utilized. Ammonia (NH 3 ) feed rate control algo-rithm development is carried out. Two control algorithms are evaluated: a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> control algorithm, using a pre ammonia injection ceramic NOx sensor and a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> plus feedback control algorithm, us-ing a pre ammonia injection ceramic NOx sensor and post catalyst ceramic NOx sensor to generate feedback signals.

Therefore, in this study, we consider a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> artificial neural network with small-world topology and analyze its performance on classifying the epilepsy. In order to obtain the small-world network, we follow the Watts-Strogatz approach. An EEG dataset taken from healthy and epileptic patients is used to test the performance of the network.

By comparing the performance of small-world and regular <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> artificial neural networks, it is shown that the Watts-Strogatz small-world network topology improves the learning performance and decreases the training time.

40|$|Whenever {{disturbance}} {{measures are}} available, {{it is possible}} to achieve increased performance on a process control system if those signals are included in the control action. In order to be effective, this action should simultaneously cancel the disturbance effect on the output. Since this compensator only depends on the value of the disturbance measure it is designated by <b>feed</b> <b>forward.</b> The <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> compensator design requires, however, more precise knowledge of the model and of the disturbances characteristics. In this thesis, predictive adaptive algorithms with <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> terms are considered in order to overcome the drawbacks of a batch design of such compensators. Namely, the <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> Musmar and Siorhc algorithms are considered. The convergence points are taken from simulation examples and directly compared with the optimal L Q solutions, previously determined. The Musmar <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> algorithm with restrictions on control action variance is considered. This restriction is done by changing, online, the control weight on the quadratic cost functional. The possible convergence points on this algorithms are characterized using the Ode method for analysing stochastic algorithms and the Theory of Singular Perturbations. Since the lack of knowledge about the process model could be a problem during the startup phase of the adaptive algorithm, a dual version of the <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> Musmar algorithm is derived. The dual approximation is based on a bicriterial solution.
