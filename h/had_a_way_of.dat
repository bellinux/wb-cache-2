One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece.

500|$|Harrison's guitar {{work with}} the Beatles was varied and flexible; {{although}} not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the Rubber Soul album and [...] "Here Comes the Sun", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was [...] "clearly an innovator" [...] as he was [...] "taking certain elements of R and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique". Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as [...] "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely {{in the service of}} the song". Harrison's friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed: [...] "He just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play." [...] The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence.|$|E

But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass.

The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery.

That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

[...] Among the boarders were Ruth Roman, Suzan Ball and Linda Christian. According to Doris Lilly, a former boarder and later society columnist, [...] "The dignity {{of the house in}} general was presided over and encouraged by Kristine Miller, who was blonde haired, high of cheekbone, grey eyed.

2500|$|On 10 April 1730, after a {{substantial}} campaign to pardon Charteris, joined, remarkably, by Anne Bond (who was possibly {{prompted by the}} promise of an annuity), King George II granted him a royal pardon. [...] As a convicted felon, his property should have been forfeit under the doctrine of attainder, but he petitioned the King for its return. [...] In composition for his offence, he paid substantial sums to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex. [...] He was also suspected of having given substantial gifts to various important individuals. [...] Jonathan Swift commented on Charteris in several poems. [...] In Lines on the Death of Dr. Swift (1731), he explains [...] "Chartres" [...] as, [...] "a most infamous, vile scoundrel, grown from a foot-boy, or worse, to a prodigious fortune both in England and Scotland: he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> insinuating himself into all Ministers under every change, either as pimp, flatterer, or informer.

In La traviata, everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In Medea, everything was angular. She'd never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger's walk." [...] Sandro Sequi recalls, [...] "She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many... I don't think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her." [...] Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head. Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in Il trovatore in Chicago, [...] "it was Callas's quiet listening, rather than Björling's singing that made the dramatic impact... He didn't know what he was singing, but she knew." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Franklin {{established}} himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two [...] "wretched little" [...] news sheets, Andrew Bradford's The American Weekly Mercury, and Samuel Keimer's Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette. This instruction in all {{arts and sciences}} consisted of weekly extracts from Chambers's Universal Dictionary. Franklin quickly did away with all this {{when he took over}} the Instructor and made it The Pennsylvania Gazette. The Gazette soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called [...] "The Busy-Body", which he wrote for Bradford's American Mercury in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the Tatler. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the [...] "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, Samuel Keimer.|$|E
2500|$|Just as Tamino in The Magic Flute, Henry IV {{falls in}} love with a painted image. [...] With Amor the Cupid as his escort, Hymenaios, the god of marriage, {{displays}} the princess Marie on canvas to her future king and husband. [...] Meanwhile, Jupiter and Juno are sitting atop clouds looking down on Henry as they provide the viewer a key example of marital harmony and thus show approval for the marriage. A personification of France is shown behind Henry in her helmet, her left hand showing support, sharing in his admiration of the future sovereignty. Rubens <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> depicting France that was very versatile in gender in many of his paintings in the cycle. [...] Here France takes on an androgynous role being both woman and man at the same time. Frances's intimate gesture may suggest a closeness between Henry and his country. This gesture would usually be shared among male companions, telling each other's secret. The way France is also dressed shows how female she is on top revealing her breasts and the way the fabric is draped adding notions of classicism. [...] However her bottom half, most notably her exposed calves and Roman boots hints at a masculinity. A sign of male strength in the history of imagery was their stance and exposed strong legs. This connection between the two show that not only are the gods in favor of the match, the King also has the well wishes of his people.|$|E
