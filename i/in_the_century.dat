5|$|In 1933, Bengt Strömgren {{introduced}} the term Hertzsprung–Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram. This name reflected the parallel {{development of this}} technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> {{following}} its adoption, the guidon gained significant popularity, being flown {{not only by}} the state but frequently also by its residents and businesses. In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the best design among the 72 official flags of the U.S. states and territories and Canadian provinces. Ohio's ranked 15th.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} has {{had different}} names and different spellings over the years. For example, {{the village was}} called Adrintone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century,</b> Arreton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century,</b> Artone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century,</b> Atherton and Adherton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14th <b>century,</b> Adderton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th <b>century,</b> and Aireton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th <b>century.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century</b> <b>the</b> {{village was}} {{recorded}} as Catmere.

50|$|Buckland's toponym evolved through spellings {{that include}} Boclande <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10th <b>century,</b> Bocheland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century,</b> Bochelanda <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century,</b> and Boclonde, Bokeland and Bikeland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century.</b>|$|R
5|$|King's End was {{developed}} as a residential road in the early 1900s. By 1907, {{the first of the}} new homes were completed and residents began to move into them. The road was named King's End Avenue, though reverted to the original name of King's End later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> from 1882, Arthur Blomfield {{and his son}} Charles made further {{additions}} and modifications, including restoring and reinstating the Shrine of StWerburgh. More {{work was}} carried out in the 20thcentury by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913, and by F.H.Crossley in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The new castle {{was used}} to hold French prisoners taken in at Poitiers in 1357, {{including}} John II, who was held for a considerable ransom. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the castle also found favour with Richard II. Richard conducted restoration work on St George's Chapel, the work being carried out by Geoffrey Chaucer, {{who served as a}} diplomat and Clerk of The King's Works.|$|E
50|$|Bayworth's toponym {{has evolved}} from Baegenweorthe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10th <b>century</b> through Baiorôe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century,</b> Baiwurde <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century</b> and Beyworth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century</b> before {{reaching}} its current form.|$|R

5|$|There {{had been}} {{reported}} problems with smuggling around Hurst Castle since the 1670s, and these continued into the 18th century. In 1729, the Revenue service hired the Hurst, a wide, heavy yacht, to assist in anti-smuggling operations out of Southampton, arming its crew with muskets, pistols and swords. The problems persisted and, later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the site {{was used as a}} rendezvous for smugglers led by a notorious criminal called John Streeter.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
50|$|Steventon's toponym {{evolved from}} Stivetune <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century</b> via Estiventona <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century,</b> Stiveton, Stivington, Estiventon, Stiventon, Stuvinton and Steveington <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century</b> and Stephyngton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th <b>century</b> before {{reaching}} its present form.|$|R

5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|By 1725, {{the castle}} had become ruinous. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> {{the remains of}} the castle was sold to the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the stone to {{construct}} their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, the carved stone Elizabethan arms of the castle were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Roman Empire {{recalled}} its legions from the province of Britannia in 410, parts of the island had already been settled by pagan Germanic tribes who, later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> appear to have taken control of Kent and other coastal regions. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory sent a group of missionaries to Kent to convert Æthelberht, King of Kent, whose wife, Bertha of Kent, was a Frankish princess and practising Christian. Augustine was the prior of Gregory's own monastery in Rome and Gregory prepared {{the way for the}} mission by soliciting aid from the Frankish rulers along Augustine's route.|$|E
50|$|Seacourt's toponym {{is derived}} from the Old English {{apparently}} meaning the homestead of an Anglo Saxon man called Seofeca. It evolved from Seofecanwyrthe and Seovecurt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10th <b>century,</b> through Sevacoorde and Sevecurt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century,</b> Sewkeworth and Seuekwrth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century,</b> Sevecheworda and Sevecowrthe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century</b> and Sekworth and Sewecourte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th <b>century.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century</b> <b>the</b> village's toponym was Olvrichestone. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century</b> {{its forms}} {{included}} Wulwricheston, Wluricheston and Wulevycheston.

5|$|Captain Scarlet, {{the eighth}} of ten puppet series that the Andersons {{produced}} during the 1950s and 1960s, {{was preceded by}} Thunderbirds and followed by Joe 90 and The Secret Service. In terms of visual aesthetic, the series represented a departure from Thunderbirds on account of its use of non-caricatured puppets sculpted in realistic proportions. Re-run {{a number of times}} in the UK and purchased by the BBC in 1993, the 32-episode series has entailed tie-in merchandise since its first appearance, from dolls to original novels and comic strips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Century</b> 21 Publications children's magazine, TV Century 21.|$|E
5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} {{continued in}} the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by Champollion's translation of hieroglyphs. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the area was visited by Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General.|$|E
50|$|The estate has {{had several}} owners, including, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th <b>century,</b> <b>the</b> Norton family, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th <b>century</b> <b>the</b> Ffolliott family, {{followed}} by Walker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th <b>century.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the village}} has evolved over <b>the</b> <b>centuries.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 11th <b>century,</b> it was {{variously}} spelt Hammescle, Hanslepe or Anslepe. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century,</b> it was Hameslepe or [...] Hamslape, and the latter form continued <b>in</b> use into <b>the</b> 14th <b>century.</b> It was Hanslopp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th <b>century</b> and Hanslap or Anslope <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th <b>century.</b> Anslap, Anslapp and Hanslapp were used early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th <b>century</b> and Hanslape was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th <b>century.</b> <b>The</b> toponym's etymology is from the Old English for a muddy place or slope belonging to a man called Hama.|$|R

5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is interpreted as an argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.|$|E
5|$|Freemasons, {{members of}} a European fraternal {{organization}} that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century, developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times. Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions. After Sethos was published, several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel. Late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> Masonic writers, still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story, used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry's supposedly ancient origin. Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson's Egyptian initiation: trials by three or four elements, often taking place under the pyramids. The best-known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 1791 opera The Magic Flute, in which the main character, Tamino, undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris.|$|E
5|$|From 1811 to 1820, George III {{suffered}} a severe bout {{of what is}} now believed to be porphyria, an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future George IV, ruled in his stead as Prince Regent. During the Regency and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined, and by the time of his successor, William IV, the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, and appointed a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The king {{had no choice but to}} recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV's reign, the Reform Act 1832, which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.|$|E
