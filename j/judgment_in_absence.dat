40|$|Punitiveness of overt and covert narcissists was {{examined}} in a non-ego-threatening condition. In judging fictitious criminal cases, high scorers in overt narcissism were as punitive as low scorers; this result was independent of crime severity. For covert narcissism, however, high scorers were more punitive toward a serious crime and more lenient toward a mild crime, {{when compared to}} low scorers. This study provides pioneering data on narcissists' punitive <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of ego threat, which has been over-looked by previous research. The findings not only support the theoretical distinction between the overt and covert subtypes of narcissism, but also help clarify the meaning of punishment to narcissists. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The recent, {{influential}} Social Intuitionist Model {{of moral}} judgment (Haidt, Psychological Review 108, 814 – 834, 2001) proposes a primary role for fast, automatic and affectively charged moral intuitions {{in the formation}} of moral judgments. Haidt’s research challenges our normative conception of ourselves as agents capable of grasping and responding to reasons. We argue {{that there can be no}} ‘real’ moral <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of a capacity for reflective shaping and endorsement of moral judgments.

Experiment 1 could replicate these findings and extend Kellen and Klauer’s results to faces. Alternatively, the evidence indicating that faces are processed differently from words suggests the possibility that recognition of faces may be mediated differently than words. According to the dual-process view of the relative judgment theory, evidence of continuous mediation would signal that relative <b>judgments</b> (<b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of recollection) involve the weighing of diagnostic memorial evidence (like SDT), but evidence of discrete-state mediation would be indicative of a reliance on a non-diagnostic guessing process (as in the 1 HT).

40|$|The {{effects of}} a truly {{uncertain}} future are more far-reaching than what has traditionally been assumed in transaction cost economics. Uncertain governance choices require that agents exercise <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of other means of estimating the payoffs associated with complex combinations of transaction attributes, contractual contingencies, and governance structures. Judgments are made on an experimental basis to incrementally improve actors’ heterogeneous cognitive representations of the contractual landscape. I argue that uncertain governance choices are subject to specific decision-biases that interact with the potentially corrective function of current organization and asymmetries in actors’ access to decision-supporting systems. These asymmetries may affect the contracting parties’ preferences over differential governance structures. Specifically, by overestimating individual unbiased rationality and disregarding how access to decision-supporting systems may affect governance choice, transaction cost economics {{runs the risk of}} underestimating the degree of vertical integration in actual firms...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} how expectancy {{violations of}} exposure duration affected preference for neutral faces. In two experiments, participants evaluated pictures of neutral faces, ostensibly exposed {{for the duration}} of 8 (Experiment 1) or 10 (Experiment 2) [*]seconds each. Exposure duration was manipulated by varying actual exposure time within participants as being either 2 [*]seconds shorter (time "flies") or 2 [*]seconds longer (time "drags") than expected. Results confirmed the intuitive hypothesis that neutral faces would be evaluated more positively in situations where time seemed to "fly" compared with situations where time seemed to "drag". However, comparing affective <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> both expectancy violation conditions to an expectancy control (i. e., no expectancy violation) condition (Experiment 2) indicated that violations of expected exposure duration actually attenuated affective judgments, such that affective <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of temporal discrepancies were most positive.

40|$|Motivated biases are {{considered}} under an integrative theoretical framework which specifies {{the interplay between}} motivation, situational affordances, and cognitive resources. According to this framework, motivation influences the cognitive strategies taken in a given situation. Then, cognitive resources are channeled to the appropriate set of cognitive processes suggested by the dominant motivation. The presence of cognitive resources allows information processing to be directed at either reaching an accurate decision, or overcoming reality constraints impeding one from reaching a desirable <b>judgment.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>absence</b> of cognitive resources the dominant motivation, whether it be accuracy or directional motivation, has a lesser impact when reaching the desired judgment is made difficult.

Little is known, however, {{as to how}} {{preferences for}} behavior {{may be influenced by}} hormonal factors. Here, we demonstrate that social properties of facial motion influence attractiveness <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of other cues, and that women’s preferences for these displays vary over the menstrual cycle, as has been demonstrated for structural traits of men’s faces in static stimuli. We produced shape-standardized facial models that were animated with male movement and assessed for flirtatiousness by 16 women and attractiveness by 47 women. In fertile phases of the men-strual cycle, women showed stronger preferences for flirta-tious movement, but not for absolute movement. These data show that women (1) recognize specific mating-relevant so-cial cues in male facial movement and (2) are differentially influenced by these cues at different phases of the menstrual cycle. This preference for flirtatiousness may promote the adaptive allocation of mating effort towards men who are, in turn, likely to respond positively...|$|R
40|$|Moral luck {{describes}} the peculiar process of appraisal {{that occurs when}} someone is praised or blamed for actions or traits stemming from factors beyond her control. The reason that this phenomenon is philosophically problematic – rather than say, psychologically interesting – is because it is both common and resistant to change. Although we tend to see morality as something that is immune to luck, we find ourselves unable to form moral <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of it. The focus of this thesis is on Thomas Scanlon’s theory of blame and whether it successfully resolves luck’s apparent paradox. Contrary to our general moral intuitions, Scanlon argues that an agent {{can and should be}} held responsible for actions that reveal something about her (either good or bad), regardless of whether it is the result of factors under her control. Despite its many insights, Scanlon’s theory, I argue, neglects and confuses some of the more important features of impermissibility and blame. For this reason and others, Scanlon fails to resolve the problem presented by moral luck...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the role of subjectives familiarity in the implicit and explicit learning of artificial grammars. Experiment 1 found that objective measures of similarity (including fragment frequency and repetition structure) predicted ratings of familiarity, that familiarity ratings predicted grammaticality judgments, and that the extremity of familiarity ratings predicted confidence. Familiarity was further shown to predict <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of confidence, hence contributing to above-chance guessing. Experiment 2 found that confidence developed as participants refined {{their knowledge of the}} distribution of familiarity and that differences in familiarity could be exploited prior to confidence developing. Experiment 3 found that familiarity was consciously exploited to make grammaticality judgments including those made without confidence and that familiarity could in some instances influence participants; grammaticality judgments apparently without their awareness. All 3 experiments found htat knowledge distinct from familiarity was derived only under deliberate learning conditions. The results provide decisive evidence that familiarity is the essential source of knowledge in artificial grammar learning while also supporting a dual-process model of implicit and explicit learning...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to what {{commentators}} have usually claimed, Kant 2 ̆ 7 s Critique of Judgment is a unified work. In particular, its investigations of (1) problems of induction and empirical concept formation, (2) judgments of beauty, and (3) teleological judgments about organisms are all {{motivated by a}} concern with a single underlying cognitive ability or capacity: namely, reflective judgment. This concern structures {{the work in the}} following way. The two Introductions to the Critique of <b>Judgment</b> argue that, <b>in</b> order for the application of concepts to intuitions, or the discovery or formation of concepts for intuitions, to be possible, we require a reflective faculty of judgment that must be capable of establishing appropriate relations between intuitions and concepts in accordance with rules that are neither abstractable from what is given in sensation, nor embodied in established systems of concepts and (causal or logical) laws. Following this, the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment examines <b>judgments</b> of beauty, <b>in</b> which one finds the purest exercise of reflective judgment, or the exercise <b>in</b> which reflective <b>judgment</b> shows itself to be capable of formulating universally valid <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of any conceptual determination of its objects. Finally, the Critique of Teleological Judgment considers teleological judgments about organisms, which involve an application of reflective judgment that is of less general significance than its aesthetic application, but that must be carefully distinguished from the latter application for the reason that the two are apt to be (and have historically been) confused with one another. The picture of reflective judgment that emerges out of all of this is that of a cognitive ability which, although its employment is irremediably practical, (inter) subjective, and context-bound, nevertheless possesses its own rule-governedness or lawfulness which cannot be seen as a function of either the apprehension of sensory content or the application of universal concepts or laws. ...|$|R

Whereas adults were able to selectively accept target items and to reject familiar nontarget items in ail exclusion task, this discrimination was more difficult for children, as {{was evident in the}} high false alarm rates to nontargets even when item memory was controlled for. The analysis of the adults' ERPs revealed more flexible and task-appropriate retrieval mechanisms, as was evident in the correlates of familiarity, recollection, mid nontarget retrieval, as well as in postretrieval evaluation. In contrast, children's ERPs revealed a parietal old/new effect for targets taken as a putative correlate of recollection. These findings suggest that children rely predominantly oil recollection during recognition <b>judgments,</b> even <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of efficient memory control processes.

40|$|In 1999, AHEAD {{formally}} approved {{its first}} set of Program Standards. The Standards spelled out the services considered essential for ensuring equal access to education for students with disabilities. In addition, the Standards were intended to establish the parameters of what practitioners {{do as well as}} assert the credibility and uniqueness of the Office For Students With Disabilities (Jarrow, 1997). The Standard’s utility diminished due to a number of factors, but especially the changing nature of disability services. Thus, a survey consisting of 30 service components and 147 performance indicators was completed by a group of postsecondary disability services experts to get a current look at today’s services. This survey led to the updated AHEAD Program Standards and Performance Indicators, which were formally approved in November 2004. Postsecondary institutions have rapidly expanded their programs and services for students with disabilities during the past 30 years.

Though services for college-level students with disabilities expanded throughout the eighties and nine-ties, there were no empirical data upon which to develop model programs until the late 1990 s, leaving disability service providers to develop services based upon intu-ition or best guess (Gajar, 1992).

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the meaningfulness of the {{material}} increases judged size, whereas symmetry decreases size judgments. These findings have been interpreted in terms of information processing, with a greater quantity of information leading to a judgment of larger size. An alternative view based on biofunctional understanding theory emphasizes the quality of affordance-triggered biological activity as reported and observed in attitudes toward playing sports, effortless understanding, knowledge-in-action, meditative wisdom, and body-mind cycle of adaptation. This alternative implies that affordance biofunctional activity is naturally size-diminishinging as it moves toward coherence and size-expanding as it moves away from coherence influencing judgments of size accordingly. Here we tested this hypothesis in the realm of sensorimotor integration. Our first experiment showed that phonologically unpronounced or symmetric symbols elicit smaller size judgments than phonologically pronounced and asymmetric symbols. Next, we manipulated the quantity of meaning with the affordance (possibilities for biofunctional activity) orthogonally in a second experiment, results indicated that meaning affects size <b>judgments</b> only <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of phonological information.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} are reported which investigate {{the possibility of}} habituation of externally-controlled covert orienting with repetition. A brief event in the visual field (for example, a luminance change) can speed the detection response to a target if it occurs in the same location within approx. 100 msec and can bias temporal order <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of eye movements. This early facilitatory component {{is seen as the}} result of an externally-controlled covert orienting response, that is, the realignment of attention, but not the eyes, with the location of the initial event. However, after approx. 300 msec, the response to a target appearing in the same location is slower than to one appearing elsewhere (the inhibitory component). Experiment 1 employed a cue-target procedure, the subject's task being to ignore each non-informative cue but to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of each target. Three conditions were investigated which differed according to the number of consecutive cues presented in the same location [1, 5, 30]. Facilitatory and inhibitory components were present in all three, indicating that under these conditions, externally-controlled covert orienting does not habituate with repetition and occurs to non-random as well as random sequences of cues. In addition, there was evidence that the inhibitory component is larger for a response to a target appearing in the same location as the cue and the previous target than in the same location as the cue only. In order to investigate this further, a continuous target-target procedure was used in experiments 2 and 3 (simple and choice reaction time, with 3 and 1 response-stimulus intervals respectively), which demonstrated that inhibition does not build up over successive repetitions of targets appearing in the same location, but actually decreases. The results are discussed in relation to the possible functions of the facilitatory and inhibitory components in maintaining selectivity in visual space...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholder {{participation}} is advocated widely, {{but there is}} little structured, empirical research into its influence on policy development. We aim to further the insight into the characteristics of participatory policy development by comparing it to expert-based policy development for the same case. We describe the process of problem framing and analysis, as well as the knowledge base used. We apply an uncertainty perspective to reveal differences between the approaches and speculate about possible explanations. We view policy development as a continuous handling of substantive uncertainty and process uncertainty, and investigate how the methods of handling uncertainty of actors influence the policy development. Our findings suggest that the wider frame that was adopted in the participatory approach {{was the result of a}} more active handling of process uncertainty. The stakeholders handled institutional uncertainty by broadening the problem frame, and they handled strategic uncertainty by negotiating commitment and by including all important stakeholder criteria in the frame. In the expert-based approach, we observed a more passive handling of uncertainty, apparently to avoid complexity. The experts handled institutional uncertainty by reducing the scope and by anticipating windows of opportunity in other policy arenas. Strategic uncertainty was handled by assuming stakeholders' acceptance of noncontroversial measures that balanced benefits and sacrifices. Three other observations are of interest to the scientific debate on participatory policy processes. Firstly, the participatory policy was less adaptive than the expert-based policy. The observed low tolerance for process uncertainty of participants made them opt for a rigorous "once and for all" settling of the conflict. Secondly, in the participatory approach, actors preferred procedures of traceable knowledge acquisition over controversial topics to handle substantive uncertainty. This excluded the use of expert judgment only, whereas the experts relied on their <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of a satisfactory model. Thirdly, our study provides empirical evidence for the frequent claim that stakeholder involvement increases the quality of the knowledge base for a policy development process.
