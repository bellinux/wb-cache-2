5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|Motorways exist {{around the}} largest cities; {{many of the}} larger cities have {{introduced}} toll schemes to help finance roads. In 2008, 130 ferry routes remained in service, operated by private companies on contract with the Public Roads Administration. Since the 1970s the heaviest rural investments have been mainland connections to replace the many car ferries that are needed to cross fjords and connect to islands. There are not enough funding through tax money, so these tunnels and bridges are normally financed mainly through toll fees. Some mountain passes have severe snowstorm problems in the winter, so often {{they have to be}} closed, or cars <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> after a snowplow in a column. The most exposed mountain passes are closed the entire winter.|$|E
25|$|As {{this route}} is {{contracted}} {{with a private}} company, fares are high. A monthly pass costs $232, while one-way cash fare is $12. Because of this, some Embrun residents instead take OC Transpo route #232, which has a stop at a park and ride lot 8km north of Embrun. This is considerably cheaper (Route #232 costs $119 for a monthly pass and $4.65 for one-way), but less convenient, as OC Transpo does not service the community itself, meaning Embrun residents <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> 8km {{to the park and}} ride lot to ride OC Transpo. Route 232 also has later scheduled times—the latest trip on the 232 arrives in Ottawa for 8:20am, and leaves Ottawa at 5:15pm, which is much more convenient for Embrun residents who work 9-5 workweeks.|$|E

25|$|Piper's Row is a {{proposed}} {{stop for the}} Midland Metro tram service in Wolverhampton. The possibility of extending the Metro from its current terminus at St George's in the city centre to the town's railway station, via its bus station {{has long been a}} priority of Centro. In March 2014 it was announced that the extension would go ahead as part of a £2bn connectivity package for the whole region. Early discussions have suggested that existing services will continue from The Royal up to Piper's Row and Wolverhampton station, missing out St George's completely, except for busy periods of the day, but this is as yet unconfirmed. The layout of the town made the initially-envisaged 'loop' behind St George's uneconomical, and now services stopping at the old terminus will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> in and wait for the driver to switch ends before backing out again to continue the journey.|$|E
500|$|A running gag in {{the series}} is Mrs. Puff's {{extensive}} criminal record. SpongeBob regularly lands her in jail accidentally {{as a result of}} his reckless driving since she takes full responsibility for his actions as if she were his mother. This gag is introduced in [...] "Hall Monitor", when Mrs. Puff is held responsible after SpongeBob inadvertently destroys Bikini Bottom. In [...] "Doing Time", SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to break her out of prison to no avail. It is revealed that she prefers prison to working as a teacher because she does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> with SpongeBob. In [...] "No Free Rides", it is implied that Mrs. Puff once had to move to a new town and start a new school with a new name.|$|E

[...] Loeb, who was familiar with driving on nighttime stages in the French Rally Championship, said, [...] "In the dark you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> like you can when you have only two passes on the recce, and then you also start with the fastest stage.

2500|$|The carding mill {{closed and}} was {{demolished}} {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, though the adjacent factory building remains in the valley today. The valley it is in took the name [...] "Carding Mill Valley", and is now a tourist attraction and well-known starting location for walkers (being at the heart of the Long Mynd range). It is owned (along with the entire hill range) by the National Trust, who have a visitor centre there. The mill building itself has been converted into flats and a number of other private houses exist near it and the visitor centre, forming a small settlement in the valley. Vehicles (and therefore most visitors) <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> up from the town, from Shrewsbury Road, to access the valley.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{signed to}} Interscope Records, and in June 1994 {{used the money}} {{acquired}} from their recording contract to relocate from Brookfield to Fort Collins, Colorado, where Alvarez had lived {{as a child and}} where drummer Bill Stevenson's girlfriend lived. [...] "We moved to Fort Collins {{with the advent of the}} major label because we finally had enough money to live like normal people after all those years", Alvarez later said. [...] "That was the first time we had ever lived in separate residences. At the time I was actually married, which was a new one for the band to deal with, and everyone’s moving in their different circles, but we kept touring and making records." [...] "Los Angeles was too big. Brookfield was too small. This is just right", he said in 1995. [...] "When we lived in Brookfield and wanted to do a local gig, we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> two hours to Columbia or six hours to St. Louis. It's a lot easier here, and the kids are real cool. So I think we'll stay." ...|$|E
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive.

I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time.

2500|$|In February1950, New York State Senator Arthur H. Wicks {{announced}} that the funds for construction of NY214 would be put into a contract by May 1. The plans were completed and bridge designs were being finished. On May 16, the state {{announced that}} the bid would be let on the second section of NY214. By September, things had gone backwards after an automobile with four children fell {{off the side of}} NY214 due to the roadway caving in. This caused yet another parent strike, refusing to let their kids ride the bus on September 27. Senator Wicks called the capital in Albany {{to find out what the}} delay was in construction. The state noted that because NY214 was not maintained by the state, but by Greene County, that it would require approval by the Federal Bureau of Roads in Washington D.C.. The state noted that they cannot do any construction until once approval on the plans was obtained. In response, Wicks arranged to get the contract let advertised on October 12 and that a bid would be accepted by November 15. Residents were continuing to hold students from taking the bus to school and that the road was falling apart in numerous areas and that people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> on the shoulder regularly. However, there were no bidders on the contract, and the New York State Department of Public Works opened more bids on December 13 for the [...] long section of NY214 at the cost of $214,000.|$|E

50|$|Only once in {{the history}} of Fear Factor did the $50,000 top prize go {{unclaimed}} in an episode.

In the stunt, one member of each team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a ramp car, while the other member <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a sports car.
