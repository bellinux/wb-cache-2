5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a surprise to Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used to applauding between movements.|$|E

There is a high percentage of interracial marriage between ethnic Liberians and the Lebanese, resulting in a significant mixed-race population especially in and around Monrovia. A small minority of Liberians who are White Africans of European descent reside in the country. The Liberian constitution restricts citizenship to people of African descent.|$|E

25|$|While it may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a {{surprise}} to Rivers, the offer of a Cambridge lectureship had come about {{as part of a}} long process of evolution within the University's Natural Science Tripos. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, had examined subject and reported unfavourably on the scant knowledge of the special senses displayed by the candidates; it was in reaction to this that Sir Michael Foster, who had seen the potential in this shy, retiring Bart's man, appointed Rivers as a lecturer and he became Fellow Commoner at St John's College forthwith. He was to become a Fellow of the College in 1902.|$|E
25|$|The {{second account}} by Yahya of Antioch, and also cited by Ibn al-'Adim, holds that Nasr's coup took {{place after the}} Battle of Azaz. Accordingly, when Thimal left Aleppo to bring back his family to the city after Nasr's victory over the Byzantines, Nasr {{took control of the}} citadel in his absence. Historian Suhayl Zakkar asserts that this account was the more likely scenario, {{particularly}} since Nasr immediately appealed for Byzantine forgiveness and protection, offering an annual tribute of 500,000 dirhams, despite his decisive victory over Romanos at Azaz; Zakkar explains that Nasr's spontaneous offer to the Byzantines must <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a result of Kilabi dissent or threats toward his rule organized by Thimal in response to the latter's ouster.|$|E
500|$|Edwards' report {{contained}} {{his account}} of Courtenay's death in battle, and it was widely accepted at the time. However rumours began circulating that Courtenay had not been killed but merely stunned by the blow, and that his death may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a result of Edwards order {{for him to be}} thrown overboard. This second account was accepted by Courtenay's family and shortly after Edwards' death in January 1823 from the effects of the wound he received in the action with Embuscade, the naval officer and historian Edward Pelham Brenton published his work Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822, in which he wrote that: ...|$|E

500|$|The Earl of Devon {{remained}} {{imprisoned for}} only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably – in Storey's words – [...] "countermanded." [...] This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's [...] "waning" [...] position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end: Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a considerable relief" [...] to the earl. He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son John Courtenay, with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. Commissions of oyer and terminer were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the Earl of Wiltshire. Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown [...] "was obviously unimpressed" [...] by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of Clarendon. The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in Abingdon within eighteen months. His will was executed by {{some of the most important}} men on the Queen's council.|$|E
500|$|These moves {{served to}} tighten Ptolemaic {{control over the}} Aegean, but his active {{intervention}} in the war was unsuccessful. In 266 BC, Patroclus with his troops tried to aid the Athenians. The literary references to the subsequent events are limited to brief statements by Pausanias, which indicate that the Ptolemaic troops proved ineffective. Patroclus requested {{the assistance of the}} Spartan king Areus I, excusing his inability to take the offensive alone with the comment that his men were native Egyptians and sailors. As Hans Hauben comments, this comment may reveal more about [...] "a certain Greek (and Macedonian) milieu" [...] and its [...] "visceral contempt for native Egyptians", rather than have any basis in facts. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence on the island of Patroklos and other fortified sites in Attica suggest that Patroclus' involvement was more extensive than implied by Pausanias: coins, pottery shards, and remnants of fortifications point to a Ptolemaic presence not only on the southeastern shores of Attica, such as the peninsula of Koroni or a coastal fort in the deme of Atene, but further inland as well, in Ilioupoli and Mount Hymettus, and on the southwestern shores, at Vouliagmeni. This presence implies an attempt to neutralize the fortress of Sounion on the extreme south of Attica, which was probably also under Antigonid control, as well as an effort to supply Athens overland, bypassing the Antigonid-controlled Piraeus. In the event, although the Spartan army may <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> close as Kamatero, they could not advance further, and withdrew. Patroclus' envisaged two-pronged attack on the Antigonid army did not materialize. Epigraphical evidence from the coastal Athenian outpost of Rhamnous, which was being harassed by the Antigonid army and pirates collaborating with them, or simply taking advantage of the general chaos, also attests to the fact that Athenian and Ptolemaic attempts to safeguard Attica were not wholly effective.|$|E

[...] Putin's support of the anti-American terrorist organizations and rogue states [...] "set the stage for the invasion of Georgia as Putin sought to spread Russian influence throughout the South Caucasus as well as the Middle East." [...] Putin offered Russian citizenship to people living in the separatist regions, and encouraged the South Ossetians to periodically fire artillery shells at Georgian positions outside of South Ossetia, forcing Saakashvili into a military response against the region, thus providing a pretext for Russian military to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{is asked}} to help the Prime Minister, Edward Ferrier, whose {{predecessor}} in the role was his father-in-law John Hammett, now Lord Cornworthy.

Poirot is uninterested until the Home Secretary, Sir George Conway, uses the phrase [...] "The Augean Stables" [...] at which point he agrees to assist. Poirot visits Percy Perry, the seedy editor of The X-Ray News who he has heard has previously accepted sums of money for not printing stories.
