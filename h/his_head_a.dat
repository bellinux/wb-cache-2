He examined Behra briefly and shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>A</b> hospital bulletin stated that Behra broke {{most of his}} ribs {{in addition to the}} skull fracture which killed him.

25|$|During a chili cook-off he was hosting at Vortex Spring in December, Kelly {{reportedly}} {{fell down}} the stairs and hurt <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>A</b> person present took him to his home in Ponce de Leon, where he helped Kelly shower and, afterwards, put a blanket over him and left him to rest in the bathtub. In the morning, a different person came to the house, and found his condition had worsened overnight. Emergency medical services responded to a call and took him to a hospital in Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|By 1968 {{there was}} a regular roster of IMT guest hosts, {{including}} Bert Newton, Tim Evans, Bobby Limb, Don Lane, Kevin Sanders, and Michael Preston. The announcement of Kennedy's intention to leave IMT was made in October 1969 and he left the show on the expiration of his contract 23 December 1969. His final episode features newsreader Sir Eric Pearce placing on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> crown made by the Channel Nine prop department {{in the style of}} that worn by Henry IV, symbolising Kennedy's reign as King of Australian television.|$|E

25|$|One {{analysis}} of the fight gives credit to either Holliday or Morgan Earp for firing the fatal shot at McLaury on Fremont Street. Holliday may have been on McLaury's right and Morgan Earp on his left. McLaury {{was shot in the}} right side of the head, so Holliday is often given credit for shooting him. However, Wyatt Earp had shot McLaury in his torso earlier, a shot that alone could have killed him. McLaury would have turned away after having been hit and Wyatt could have placed a second shot in <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>A</b> 30-day-long preliminary hearing found that the Earps and Holliday had acted within their duties as lawmen, although this did not pacify Ike Clanton.|$|E
25|$|In the 1972 American League Championship Series, Detroit {{faced the}} American League West {{division}} champion Oakland Athletics, {{who had become}} steadily competitive ever since the 1969 realignment. In Game 1 of the ALCS in Oakland, Lolich, the hero of '68, took the hill and allowed just one run over nine innings. Al Kaline hit a solo homer to break a 1–1 tie in the 11th inning, only {{to be charged with}} an error on Gonzalo Marquez's game-tying single that allowed Gene Tenace to score the winning run. Blue Moon Odom shut down Detroit 5–0 in Game 2. The end of Game 2 was marred by an ugly incident in which Tiger reliever Lerrin Lagrow hit A's shortstop and leadoff hitter Bert Campaneris on the ankle with a pitch. An angered Campaneris flung the bat at Lagrow, and Lagrow ducked {{just in time for the}} bat to sail over <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>A</b> bench-clearing brawl ensued, and both players were suspended for the remainder of the series.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the south}} window, the first panel of {{which shows the}} {{archangel}} Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>a</b> seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices {{of women and children}} in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM, taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose—representing suffering for both the victors and the defeated—and below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and standing before the royal coat of arms of France.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{suggestion}} of the band's guitarist, Graham Coxon, the band underwent a stylistic change, becoming influenced by American indie rock bands such as Pavement. Recording took place in London {{as well as in}} Reykjavík, Iceland. Drummer Dave Rowntree described the music on the album as being more aggressive and emotional than their previous work. Producer Stephen Street claimed that lead singer-songwriter Damon Albarn had started writing about more personal experiences while Coxon revealed that listening to his lyrics it was clear to him that [...] "he'd obviously gone off <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> bit more".|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Davis {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of her husband's capture as described below: [...] "Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowntree {{stated that}} the band decided to give Coxon a much freer hand on Blur. Street also {{observed}} a change of Albarn's writing style, as he [...] "was much more prepared to write in the first person, rather than about interesting characters. I think [...] grown a bit and was prepared to start writing about his own experiences rather than transposing them on to a character like Tracy Jacks or Dan Abnormal." [...] Coxon agreed, and felt [...] "Damon's songs were revealing {{more to me than}} to him" [...] and said that when he heard some of his home demos he realised [...] "he'd obviously gone off <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> bit more". The album features the first song to appear on a studio album in which Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang lead vocal—"You're So Great".|$|E
500|$|In literature, François Rabelais compares Gargantua's {{strength}} {{to that of}} Milo's in Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Shakespeare refers anachronistically to [...] "bull-bearing Milo" [...] in Act 2 of Troilus and Cressida. [...] In Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, character Catherine Earnshaw refers to the circumstances of Milo's demise when she says, [...] "Who is to separate us, pray? [...] They'll meet the fate of Milo!" [...] In Johann Wyss' novel Swiss Family Robinson, the youngest son Franz is entrusted with a bull buffalo to raise, and from which gains comparison to Milo. Alexandre Dumas has the strongest of the Three Musketeers, Porthos, mention [...] "Milo of Crotona" [...] {{saying that he had}} replicated a list of his feats of strength - all except breaking a cord tied around the head, whereupon d'Artagnan tells Porthos that it is because his strength is not in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> (<b>a</b> joke about Porthos being a bit dim-witted).|$|E
2500|$|Cahill {{is known}} for his {{technical}} ability, powerful heading in defence and attack, volleying, and good tackling. The centre back also has an impressive goal-scoring record from defence. Former Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas said of Cahill, [...] "I think his technical attributes are immense and his pace is fantastic." [...] Despite being a defender, Cahill is noted for his technical ability and distribution, and occasionally, for his finishing prowess, and strength with <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>A</b> quick, consistent and reliable centreback, Cahill is also known for his positioning and his ability to read the game.|$|E

2500|$|Buckingham {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey. His lavish tomb bears a Latin {{inscription}} that may be translated as [...] "The Enigma of the World". Here, too, he was depicted surrounded by mythical figures. The black marble sculptures at each corner include Mars and Neptune, in reference to his military and naval exploits; on the catafalque lie bronze-gilt effigies of the Duke and his wife (who long survived him), cast by Hubert le Sueur. Buckingham is clad in armour, enriched with crossed anchors and with an ermine cloak over it.

2500|$|In January 2009, the British tabloid, the News of the World, {{revealed}} a video made by Harry {{three years earlier}} in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as [...] "our little Paki friend" [...] and called a soldier wearing a cloth on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> [...] "raghead". These terms were described by then-Leader of the Opposition David Cameron as [...] "unacceptable", and by The Daily Telegraph as [...] "racist", with a British Muslim youth organisation calling Harry a [...] "thug". Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks. Former British MP and Royal Marine, Rod Richards, said that such nicknames were common amongst military comrades, stating [...] "in the Armed Forces people often {{used to call me}} Taffy.

2500|$|The haftarah in [...] {{tells the}} story of the prophet Elijah's flight from King Ahab, his theophany, and his anointing of Elisha.

So Elijah ran for his life to Beersheba in the Kingdom of Judah, left his servant there, and went a day's journey into the wilderness. Elijah sat down under a broom tree, asked God to take his life, and lay down and slept. An angel touched Elijah and told him to arise and eat, and Elijah found at <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>a</b> cake and a jar of water, and so he ate, drank, and went back to sleep.

Stars fall from the sky, mountains and islands move, ships sink, and people hide in caverns. According to Ridderbos, [...] "We see hail and fire burning trees and grass, a burning mountain cast into the sea destroying ships, a falling star that poisons the waters, a wailing eagle, a second falling star that opens a bottomless pit from which monstrous locusts arise, and four angels and their horsemen sent out to kill". Behind the armored angels on land, with one leg in the sea, the other on land, [...] "stands a colossal figure: the angel described as clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow upon <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>a</b> face like the sun and legs like pillars of fire", who brings down seven thunders {{as can be seen in}} the dark clouds above.|$|E
