5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection.</b> They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> can be {{complicated}} {{in that the}} depth of subcutaneous fat varies and may result in subcutaneous injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> does give a faster and higher pharmacokinetic profile when compared to subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|With <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> of 10nbsp&mg {{progesterone}} in vegetable oil, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are {{reached at}} approximately 8 hours after administration, and serum levels remain above baseline for about 24 hours. Doses of 10nbsp&mg, 25nbsp&mg, and 50nbsp&mg via <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> result in mean maximum serum concentrations of 7nbsp&ng/mL, 28nbsp&ng/mL, and 50nbsp&ng/mL, respectively. With <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection,</b> {{a dose of}} 25nbsp&mg results in normal luteal phase serum levels of progesterone within 8 hours, and a 100nbsp&mg dose produces mid-pregnancy levels. At these doses, serum levels of progesterone remain elevated above baseline for at least 48 hours, with an elimination half-life of about 22hours.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evidence}} based literature related to <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections.</b> There are many articles that support and explain aspiration with <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections,</b> the correct technique and choosing the correct site. However, also, included in this project, will be research that does not support aspiration as {{a vital part of}} the technique. This review of literature will help determine if it is safe to promote or just remove aspiration totally from <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections</b> in all clinical settings by using evidence based research...|$|R

30|$|This second etiology, patellar {{dislocation}} {{secondary to}} <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections,</b> {{was the subject}} of our study. In 1961, Hnĕvkovský [4] first stimulated an interest in this etiology by his report of progressive fibrosis of the vastus intermedius in young children who had received <b>intramuscular</b> antibiotic <b>injections.</b> Gunn [5] demonstrated a causal relationship between <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections</b> and quadriceps contracture, which, in turn, led to the habitual dislocation of the patella. Although all the conditions we now associate with this contracture are well known, the importance of the underlying muscle condition in each case has not been stressed.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} application of <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections</b> that {{are carried out}} by nurses {{in all areas of}} health care as their frequent daily activities. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether nurses have sufficient knowledge of the <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections</b> use, what needles they choose for application on cachectic and obese patients, what injection site they uses mostly, the degree of their knowledge of the Z - tract method, their experience with complications in practice, and finally whether they observe all the principles of the safe and effective application of the <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections.</b> Parenteral drug injection, needles, preparing doses from bottles of medicines and ampoules are mentioned in brief in the theoretical part. The applications of the <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injections,</b> stab points, the patient positions for application, application procedures, the method of Z - tract, specific applications and special attitudes to children and possible complications are described in the following chapters. The methodology and organization of the survey are depicted and the research findings are drawn in the empirical part of the thesis.

25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of progesterone {{are dependent}} on its route of administration. The drug is approved {{in the form of}} oil-filled capsules containing micronized progesterone for oral administration, termed oral micronized progesterone or OMP. It is also available in the form of vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, topical creams and gels, oil solutions for <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection,</b> and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin is {{administered}} through an intravenous device, <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action {{depends on the}} mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection,</b> which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{small amount}} of {{progesterone}} is converted by 21-hydroxylase into 11-deoxycorticosterone. Increases in levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone are markedly higher when progesterone is given orally as opposed to via parenteral routes like vaginal or <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection.</b> The conversion of progesterone into 11-deoxycorticosterone occurs in the intestines (specifically the duodenum) and in the kidneys. 21-Hydroxylase appears to be absent in the liver, so conversion of progesterone into 11-deoxycorticosterone is thought not to occur {{in this part of}} the body.|$|E
25|$|When {{used in the}} {{systemic}} therapy, IFNs are mostly administered by an <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection.</b> The injection of IFNs in the muscle or under the skin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are flu-like symptoms: increased body temperature, feeling ill, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, convulsion, dizziness, hair thinning, and depression. Erythema, pain, and hardness on the spot of injection are also frequently observed. IFN therapy causes immunosuppression, in particular through neutropenia and can result in some infections manifesting in unusual ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} action of progesterone {{was discovered in}} 1929. Pure crystalline progesterone was isolated in 1934 and its chemical structure was determined. Later that year, chemical synthesis of progesterone was accomplished. Shortly following its chemical synthesis, progesterone began being tested clinically in women. In 1934, Schering introduced progesterone as a pharmaceutical drug under the brand name Proluton. It was administered by <b>intramuscular</b> <b>injection</b> because it progesterone rapidly inactivated after being taken by mouth and when used by mouth required very high doses to produce an effect.|$|E
