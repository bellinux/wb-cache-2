50|$|C. a. amoenus {{is found}} from Rhode Island, southwestern Massachusetts, and southeastern New York south to South Carolina, {{northern}} Georgia, and central Alabama. It has separate internasal and prefrontal scales. No gular scales occur between the posterior chin shields. Each maxilla has 9-12 small teeth. The single hemipenis has a forked sulcus spermaticus and three large basal spines. Adult males have ridges {{on the body}} scales that are dorsal to the anal plate. The young of this species are always much darker than the parent; then during the second year they change from a dark gray to the brown of the adult specimen. C. a. amoenus is almost exclusively an <b>earthworm</b> <b>predator,</b> but has also been known to consume other prey, from slugs to small salamanders. Due to human activities, C. a. amoenus is becoming rare in some areas. It is currently protected as threatened in Massachusetts and as a species of special concern in Rhode Island.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand flatworm is an {{invasive}} species in Europe, feeding there {{almost exclusively on}} earthworms. This degrades soil quality. European <b>earthworm</b> <b>predators</b> are reluctant to eat it although cases of frogs and beetle larvae consuming flatworms have been recorded. It has been seen in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Faroe Islands. It might have arrived in the early 1960s, being first recorded in Belfast in 1963. The New Zealand flatworm is easily transported accidentally in plant pots in adult or egg form. They tend to be common in garden centres and may have arrived in the UK with exotic plants.|$|R
50|$|On Mount Kinabalu, Borneo, {{the animal}} grows to {{a length of}} {{approximately}} 70 cm and lives in burrows in the soft and thick soils around Paka Cave shelter, {{at an altitude of}} 3,000 m above sea level. The earthworm's segments are encirled by numerous setae and its skin has a greenish iridescent gloss. Amongst the Kinabalu <b>earthworm's</b> natural <b>predators</b> is another large annelid, the Kinabalu giant red leech. Both animals can only be seen during or after a heavy downpouring of rain.|$|R
40|$|Metal-contaminated {{soils are}} {{potentially}} harmful to plants, animals, and humans. Harmful effects are often {{related to the}} free-metal concentration in the soil solution. Immobilization is a potentially useful method {{to improve the quality}} of metal-contaminated soils by transforming free-metal ions into species that are less mobile and less toxic. The effect of many immobilizing products can be attributed to sorption on the surface of the material. Alkaline materials also enhance adsorption to soil particles by decreasing proton competition. Immobilization should preferably be evaluated independently of soil pH to discriminate between these processes. In this study, the immobilizing effect of beringite, an alkaline alumino silicate, was compared with that of lime. Plants (Swiss chard [Beta vulgaris L. var. cicla]) were grown on a soil contaminated with cadmium and zinc and treated with graded amounts of beringite or lime. Metal availability, as determined by a 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extraction, and metal uptake by plants strongly decreased in all treated soils. Beringite did not reduce metal availability more than liming when the obtained pH levels were similar. The effect of beringite can, therefore, be explained as a liming effect, at least for the duration of our experiment (10 weeks). The effect of beringite and lime on metal accumulation by earthworms (Eisenia veneta and Lumbricus rubellus) was small or not significant, although the CaCl 2 -extractable metal concentration in treated soils decreased by more than 90 ÐWe conclude that immobilizing agents based on a liming effect can decrease metal uptake by plants, but they will hardly affect metal uptake by earthworms. Hence, these materials can reduce negative ecological effects of metal contamination on plants and herbivores, but not on <b>earthworm</b> <b>predators...</b>|$|R
40|$|Relationships between anecic {{earthworms}} (Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea giardi) and the collembolan species Heteromurus nitidus (Templeton, 1835), {{which is}} known to be attracted to earthworms, were investigated in an 8 -week laboratory experiment. Our aims were (1) to assess whether earthworms influence the population dynamics of H. nitidus, and (2) to study pathways of influence and how earthworm effects are modified by humus forms and predators. Using microcosms with three defaunated humus forms, then provided with <b>earthworms</b> and <b>predators,</b> we intended to demonstrate that, amongst possible favourable effects of earthworms on springtail populations, earthworm activity may provide greater access and more pathways for springtails to explore soil and avoid predation. We expected that the effects of predators (centipedes) on the abundance of H. nitidus would increase from less (calcic mull) to more (moder) compact soil, and we hypothesized that earthworms would reduce predation pressure on H. nitidus by providing escape routes through increased macroporosity. Humus forms and earthworms only affected the population size of H. nitidus under high predation pressure. When collembolan numbers were higher in calcic mull than i...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that predators of soil-improving, plant-facilitating detritivores (e. g. earthworms) should suppress plant growth via a negative tri-trophic cascade, but the empirical evidence is still largely lacking. We tested this prediction in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau by manipulating predatory beetles (presence/absence) and quantifying (i) direct {{effects on the}} density and behaviour of earthworms; and (ii) indirect effects on soil properties and above-ground plant biomass. In the absence of <b>predators,</b> <b>earthworms</b> improved soil properties, but did not significantly affect plant biomass. Surprisingly, the presence of predators strengthened {{the positive effect of}} earthworms on soil properties leading to the emergence of a positive indirect effect of predators on plant biomass. We attribute this counterintuitive result to: (i) the inability of predators to suppress overall earthworm density; and (ii) the predator-induced earthworm habitat shift from the upper to lower soil layer that enhanced their soil-modifying, plant-facilitating, effects. Our results reveal that plant-level consequences of predators as transmitted through detritivores can hinge on behaviour-mediated indirect interactions that have the potential to overturn predictions based solely on trophic interactions. This work calls for a closer examination of the effects of predators in detritus food webs and the development of spatially explicit theory capable of predicting the occurrence and consequences of predator-induced detritivore behavioural shifts...|$|R

Humus forms and earthworms only affected the population size of H. nitidus under high predation pressure, when collembolan numbers were higher in calcic mull than in moder, and were increased by the presence of earthworms. These results corroborate the hypothesis that earthworms, by increasing soil macroporosity, improve the escape routes for Collembola and thus evade predation. In moder humus earthworms increased the density of H. nitidus whether predators were present or not, so we cannot exclude that earthworms were also directly beneficial to H. nitidus. However, the hypothesis of a functional relationship mediated by soil macroporosity seems relevant since it was supported by differences observed when considering body size. When two size classes were distinguished within populations of H. nitidus (1) the positive effect of earthworms in moder was observed only on larger Collembola (> 1 mm), (2) the density of the larger Collembola was decreased by predation only in moder and not in mull, (3) the effects of predators on the smaller individuals were not influenced by the presence of earthworms whatever the humus form, and was not decreased by the presence of earthworms. Nevertheless, factors other than macroporosity may operate as the presence of earthworms in acidic mull led to an unexplained decrease in the abundance of small-sized H. nitidus...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that soil fauna can {{significantly}} affect greenhouse gas emissions. However, different functional groups and different soils can influence soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions to different extents. To date, little {{attention has been paid to}} whether soil fauna interactions with each other and their predators play a significant role in CO 2 and N 2 O emissions under different tillage systems. Therefore, we studied how the interactions between soil fauna and their predators affect soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from black soil following 13 years of conservation tillage (no-till) (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). We conducted a 35 -day microcosm experiment with black arable soil and hay residue. The results indicated that the presence of <b>earthworms</b> and <b>predator</b> mites (EP) significantly increased the soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions in both NT and CT systems (P < 0. 05). However, the addition of predator mites to microcosms with earthworms and Collembola treatments (ESP) did not significantly increase the soil CO 2 (900. 7 mg CO 2 -C kg− 1 soil in NT, 991. 0 mg CO 2 -C kg− 1 soil in CT) or N 2 O (75. 9 μg N 2 O-N kg− 1 soil in NT, 79. 0 μg N 2 O-N kg− 1 soil in CT) emissions compared to earthworms and springtail (ES) treatments (CO 2 : 924. 7 mg CO 2 -C kg− 1 soil in NT, 914. 4 mg CO 2 -C kg− 1 soil in CT; N 2 O: 72. 5 μg N 2 O-N kg− 1 soil in NT, 251. 4 μg N 2 O-N kg− 1 soil in CT). Therefore, adding predators does not always increase the CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, and the different body lengths of predators and the effect of predator-prey interactions on soil physicochemical properties should be considered. We found much higher dissolved organic carbon and nitrate availability in the E, ES and EP treatments at the time of high gas emissions on day 18, indicating that the major increase in CO 2 and N 2 O emissions in these treatments may be due to enhanced denitrification. Our study indicates that under different tillage regimes, the interaction between soil fauna functional groups on the availability of C and N can decrease or increase soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions. Compared with CT soils, CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from NT soils were lower, which demonstrates that long-term conservation tillage can reduce CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from soil. The findings indicate that a more stable soil environment and food web with more intact functional groups are built in NT and may be more conducive to carbon and nitrogen sequestration for reducing soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions in the black soil region of Northeast China...|$|R
40|$|Specific primers {{can be used}} in {{polymerase}} chain reactions (PCR) {{to amplify}} prey DNA from the gut content of generalist predators at high specificity and sensitivity. A prerequisite for applying this approach to field studies, however, is to confirm that primers are actually targeting specific prey species or prey groups and do not produce false positive results by amplifying DNA either from predator species or from the wide range of potential alternative prey found under natural conditions. Here, we report on a new group-specific primer pair for earthworms designed from cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) sequences of 11 earthworm species found in Central Europe {{that can be used to}} detect consumption of <b>earthworms</b> by invertebrate <b>predators.</b> Besides inter-specific also considerable intra-specific variation was found for COI sequences among most of the earthworm species. We, therefore, combined a universal forward primer with an earthworm-specific reverse primer which amplified a 523 bp product from all 11 species tested. Earthworm DNA amplification was also successful in the presence of excess DNA of a predator species. The primer pair was tested against 82 non-target invertebrate species commonly found in the same habitats, including potential prey for generalist predators and <b>predators</b> themselves. The <b>earthworm</b> primer was highly specific: only one of the non-target species showed a product of similar length as the earthworms, whereas PCR with 12 non-target species produced amplicons whose length differed from that of earthworms. We conclude that the new primer will be a useful tool to investigate the role earthworms play as a food resource in soil food-webs. Moreover, we suggest that future studies utilizing DNA-based approaches for prey detection should select non-target species for cross-reactivity tests according to their abundance and importance rather than choosing representatives of taxonomic units; this will help validate the results achieved using species- or group-specific primers and guarantee their meaningful ecological interpretation.
