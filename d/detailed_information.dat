40|$|This study {{investigated}} eyewitnesses’ memory and confidence accuracy for action information (what {{happened at the}} crime scene), and <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> (descriptions of persons, objects, time and place). In Experiment 1, 89 participants watched a film and participated in one of four conditions: Laboratory discussion, Family discussion, Retell and Control, the first three with five meetings each. Three weeks later all participants open free recalled the events, and confidence judged their answers. The participants showed better free recall and confidence accuracy for action than for <b>detail</b> <b>information.</b> Participants in the two discussion conditions and in the Retell condition recalled more items {{and those in the}} Lab-discussion and Retell conditions more correct items for action information, than those in Control group. However, the four conditions did not differ for proportion correct of all action items recalled and confidence accuracy for action items. In brief, Experiment 1 showed that witness discussions and retellings of the experienced event with others improved recall for action information but had had no, or small, effects on confidence accuracy. Experiment 2 investigated recall and confidence accuracy performance for action and <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> using focused questions. Seventy-seven participants watched a film, answered and confidence judged 63 questions about action and <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> about the events. Again, participants showed better memory and confidence accuracy for action information. Overall, the results indicate that, for both free recall and focused questions, witnesses’ recall and confidence accuracy is better for action <b>information</b> than for <b>detail</b> <b>information,</b> thus extra precaution is nee ded in the forensic system when <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> from witnesses is considered...|$|R

5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal.

The more <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen.

40|$|A new way {{to improve}} the {{representation}} of images using a discrete wavelet transform for coding purposes is presented. The idea lies in combining all wavelet coefficients related to <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> at a same resolution level but along different orientations (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), into a single image. Given that <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> is located for all subband images {{in the neighborhood of}} high frequency textures or edge locations, the pattern of significant coefficients remains unchanged after the combination process. This process allows one to further reduce the number of transformed coefficients by 2 / 3, while preserving the multiresolution structure. This information can thus be efficiently coded using a multiresolution embedded coding scheme, such as Shapiro's (see IEEE Trans. on Signal Proc., vol. SP- 41, no. 12, p. 3445 - 62, 1993) zerotree coder. Overall, a higher coding efficiency can be reached while preserving the cross-scale prediction of significance among the coefficients. Ultimately, approximate <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> must be recovered from the combined and coded data for each subband of the original wavelet, so as to reconstruct a decoded imag...|$|R
