5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E

'The {{one thing}} I can suggest,' she said, after first {{speaking}} some <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> comfort and hope, 'is {{that we should}} consult a person of greater experience than ours.

60|$|At {{first the}} poor girl could not--would not--believe it. Then, as the truth {{gradually}} forced itself into her brain, she subsided into a tearless, expressionless, state of quiescence {{that seemed to}} indicate a mind unhinged. In this state she remained for some time, apparently unconscious of the <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Christian love that were addressed to her.|$|E

60|$|The {{tone was}} one that {{admitted}} of no rebellion. If Mr. Kendal interfered little, his authority was absolute where he did interfere, and Albinia could only speak a few <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> encouragement, but the boy was vexed and moody, seemed half asleep when they came home, {{and went to bed}} as soon as tea was over.|$|E
60|$|As to Cherry, {{she could}} only tremble, unable to speak or cry; and Mr. Froggatt called out to Alda to do {{something}} for her, when Alda said she would call Wilmet, which made Cherry burst out with 'Don't, don't!' and shudder the more with tearless sobs; but happily, Clement coming down, fetched her remedies, and did more by whispering a few <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> hope and comfort.|$|E
6000|$|Safe? What? that stiff, white-faced form, carried {{between two}} men, with the arm hanging lifelessly down? One man held the smaller figure of Armine, {{and kept his}} face pressed inwards. <b>Kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Liebe Frau," [...] and assurances that {{were meant to be}} cheering passed around her, but she heard them not. Some brandy had, it seemed, been poured into their mouths. They thought Jock had swallowed, Armine had not.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{perfected the}} American short story, {{and was the}} first American writer to place his stories firmly in the United States, even as he poached from German or Dutch folklore. He is also {{generally}} credited {{as one of the first}} to write both in the vernacular, and without an obligation to the moral or didactic in his short stories, writing stories simply to entertain rather than to enlighten. Irving also encouraged would-be writers. As George William Curtis noted, there [...] "is not a young literary aspirant in the country, who, if he ever personally met Irving, did not hear from him the <b>kindest</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> sympathy, regard, and encouragement".|$|R

60|$|Many {{thanks for}} your <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> remembrance.[15] This is not all in my own hand, because I am too much shaken to write many notes.

60|$|Bright {{and early}} the next morning the cadets {{assembled}} for their last breakfast in the mess-room. The parade was dispensed with, for some had to leave by the early boat on the lake {{in order to make the}} proper connections.

Of these a few were bound for college, while others were going into various lines of business.|$|E

60|$|Amid {{the cheers}} of the townsfolk the boats pushed off, Mr. Francis Drake {{and his brother}} waving their plumed hats to the burghers of Plymouth, and the sailors giving a hurrah, as they bent to the oars. Ned Hearne, who had {{received}} a <b>kind</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> greeting from Mr. Drake, had taken {{his place in the}} bow of one of the boats, lost in admiration at the scene; and at the thought {{that he was one of}} this band of heroes, who were going out to fight the Spaniards, and to return laden with countless treasure wrested from them. At the thought his eyes sparkled, his blood seemed to dance through his veins.|$|R

60|$|The {{effect of}} this curious caprice of fancy (as I thought it then) was not of a nature to set me at my ease, during a first {{interview}} with Miss Fairlie. The few <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> welcome which she spoke found me hardly self-possessed enough to thank her in the customary phrases of reply. Observing my hesitation, and no doubt attributing it, naturally enough, to some momentary shyness on my part, Miss Halcombe took the business of talking, as easily and readily as usual, into her own hands.|$|E
60|$|The {{party was}} {{gathered}} {{together on the}} piazza, {{ready to take the}} coach. The baggage had arrived from the camp in a cart; but Phil Matlack had not come with it, as he remained to take down his tent and settle affairs generally. They were all sorry not to see him again, for he had proved himself a good man and a good guide; but when grown-up married people elope before daybreak something must be expected to go wrong. Hearty and substantial remembrances were left for him, and <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> farewell for the bishop, and even for Miss Corona when she should appear.|$|E

For the rest, I thank you gratefully (and may I respectfully and gratefully thank Miss Bayley?) for the <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> both of you, both in this letter and as my sister heard them.

40|$|Early word {{learning}} may {{be supported}} by a developmental feedback loop: the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> a child learns early on support the development of attentional biases, which in turn facilitate further word learning. In neural network simulations and a longitudinal study of toddlers we investigated how {{the emergence of an}} attentional bias to shape in word learning impacts vocabulary growth with respect to different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> If this relationship is causal, we should see that the emergence of a shape bias leads to an increase in the rate of learning <b>of</b> shape-based <b>words</b> relative to other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> The networks supported this prediction, showing an acceleration of shape- compared to material-based word learning. However, in toddlers, shape- and material-based words were learned similarly around the shape bias emergence. Implications are discussed for the developmental feedback loop account and causal relationships between attentional bias development and vocabulary growth...|$|R

6000|$|The Bishop came {{up almost}} immediately, and the perfect tranquillity and absence of flutter fully showed poor Mrs. Underwood's old high- bred instinct. She was really gratified {{when he sat}} down by her, after {{greeting}} the three girls, and held out his hands to make friends with the lesser ones, whom their sisters led up, Angela submissive and pretty behaved, Bernard trying to hide his face, and Stella in Wilmet's arms staring to the widest extent of eyes. The sisters had their wish--the fatherless babes received the pastoral blessing; and the Bishop said a few <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> real sympathy that made Mrs. Underwood look up at him affectionately and say, 'Indeed I have much to be thankful for. My children are very good to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sophy {{heard of}} the {{arrangement}} without remark, and quietly listened to Albinia's explanation {{that she was not}} to be sent up to the attics, but was to inhabit the spare room, which was large enough to serve her for a sitting-room. But in the evening Mr. Kendal happened in her absence to take up the book which she had been reading, and did not perceive at once on her entrance that she wanted it. When he did so, he yielded it with a few <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> apology, but this vexation had been sufficient to bring down the thunder-cloud which had been lowering since the morning. There were no signs of clearance the next day; but Albinia had too much upon her hands to watch the symptoms, and was busy making measurements for the furniture in the morning-room when Mr. Kendal came in.|$|E
60|$|It was {{beautiful}} {{to see how}} Bell changed in her mood towards Crosbie and towards her sister {{as soon as she}} perceived how the affair was going. She was not long in perceiving it, having caught the first glimpses of the idea on that evening when they both dined at the Great House, leaving their mother alone to eat or to neglect the peas. For some six or seven weeks Crosbie had been gone, and during that time Bell had been much more open in speaking of him than her sister. She had been present when Crosbie had bid them good-bye, and had listened to his eagerness as he declared to Lily that he should soon be back again at Allington. Lily had taken this very quietly, as though it had not belonged at all to herself; but Bell had seen something of the truth, and, believing in Crosbie as an earnest, honest man, had spoken <b>kind</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> him, fostering any little aptitude for love which might already have formed itself in Lily's bosom.|$|E

I shall never complain {{of the way in which}} you dispose of it. I would have you believe that I love you for yourself, and not for money's sake. I want to be reconciled to you ere I leave England.
