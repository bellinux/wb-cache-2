5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist.</b> His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|Lexie {{continues}} to harbor romantic feelings for George, {{oblivious to the}} fact that he doesn't see her in the same way. Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam. Finally realizing that he doesn't feel the same way, Lexie gives up on her feelings for George and the pair's friendship begins to fizzle out. She later begins a flirtation with Mark, and the pair begin an unlikely romantic relationship, though they are forced to keep it a secret when Meredith and Derek warn Mark away from Lexie. Lexie discovers that some of her fellow interns have secretly been performing simple procedures on each other and begins taking part to prove she's hardcore. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) joins the society, and seeking a more daring procedure, suggests removing her appendix. Though Lexie agrees, she quickly finds herself out of her depth, resulting in Meredith and Cristina having to intervene to save Sadie's life. Lexie and the other interns are put on probation. Derek finds Lexie distraught at the day's events, and allows her to move into the attic at his and Meredith's house. Mark comes clean to Derek about his relationship with Lexie, resulting in the two men getting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist</b> fight. The pair continue to feud, resulting in Lexie beginning to stress eat until they eventually reconcile. Lexie is delighted when Meredith asks her to be a bridesmaid at her and Derek's wedding, though they eventually give the ceremony to Alex and cancer-stricken Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Mark decides to purchase a house and invites Lexie to move in with him, however she declines, concerned about how fast their relationship is progressing.|$|E
500|$|Flexion {{describes}} a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. [...] For example, bending the elbow, or clenching a hand <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist,</b> {{are examples of}} flexion. When sitting down, the knees are flexed. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion refers to movement in the anterior direction. Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward.|$|E

The two men began arguing on August 11, 1871, over local politics on election day in the [...] "Red Front Saloon", located in downtown Newton. The argument developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist</b> fight, with Bailey being knocked outside the saloon and into the street. McCluskie followed, drawing his pistol. He fired two shots at Bailey, hitting him with the second shot in the chest. Bailey died the next day, on August 12, 1871. McCluskie fled town to avoid arrest, but was only away {{for a few days}} before returning, after receiving information that the shooting would most likely be deemed self defense, despite the fact that Bailey never produced a weapon. McCluskie had claimed he feared for his life, having known that in three previous gunfights, Bailey had killed two men.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{defending}} team 'knocks on' or touches the ball when it's in the air, {{and the ball}} is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the tackle count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero tackle rule because the next tackle is counted as 'tackle zero' and not the usual 'tackle one'. The zero tackle rule cannot {{be used in a}} set that was started by the zero tackle rule. On awarding the zero tackle rule, the referee will shout [...] "Back to zero!" [...] or [...] "Six again", and wave one arm over his head with fingers clenched <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist,</b> indicating the attacking side's next tackle is tackle zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is tackled does not register on the tackle count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being tackled then this does not apply.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a notorious}} altercation {{between the two}} men, Calloway fired Gillespie in late 1941. The {{incident}} is recounted by Gillespie, along with fellow Calloway band members Milt Hinton and Jonah Jones, in Jean Bach's 1997 film, The Spitball Story. Calloway did not approve of Gillespie's mischievous humor, nor of his adventuresome approach to soloing; according to Jones, Calloway {{referred to it as}} [...] "Chinese music". Finally, their grudge for each other erupted over a thrown spitball. Calloway never thought highly of Gillespie, because he didn't view Gillespie as a good musician. Once during a rehearsal, a member of the band threw a spitball. Already in a foul mood, Calloway decided to blame this on Gillespie. Dizzy didn’t take the blame and the problem quickly escalated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist</b> fight in which Dizzy stabbed Calloway in leg with a knife. Calloway had minor cuts on the thigh and wrist. After the two men were separated, Calloway fired Gillespie. A few days later, Gillespie tried to apologize to Calloway, but he was dismissed.|$|E

Kirk says they cannot, but agrees to meet with Cornelius and Zira and has the group transported to their location. Once they arrive, Kirk instructs the Enterprise to use the phasers set to stun on {{a large group of}} gorillas. The two chimpanzees explain ape society to the Starfleet crew before Taylor argues that the apes should be overthrown again. Kirk turns him down, but enlists the help of the chimpanzees. Taylor abducts Pavel Chekov, steals his communicator and has himself beamed to the Enterprise. Kirk, Spock and Chekov follow him to the ship where they find him trying to steal a shuttlecraft. He and Kirk get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist</b> fight, before Taylor agrees to follow Kirk's lead back to the surface to work with the apes.

25|$|ASL {{also has}} a system of {{classifiers}} which may be incorporated <b>into</b> signs. <b>A</b> <b>fist</b> may represent <b>an</b> inactive object such as a rock (this is the default or neutral classifier), a horizontal ILY hand may represent an aircraft, a horizontal 3 hand (thumb pointing up and slightly forward) a motor vehicle, an upright G hand a person on foot, an upright V hand a pair of people on foot, and so on through higher numbers of people. These classifiers are moved through sign space to iconically represent the actions of their referents. For example, an ILY hand may 'lift off' or 'land on' a horizontal B hand to sign an aircraft taking off or landing; a 3 hand may be brought down on a B hand to sign parking a car; and a G hand may be brought toward a V hand to represent one person approaching two.|$|R

2500|$|Placing {{pressure}} on the wound constricts the blood vessels manually, helping to stem blood flow. [...] When applying pressure, the type {{and direction of the}} wound may have an effect, for instance, a cut lengthways on the hand would be opened up by closing the hand <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist,</b> whilst a cut across the hand would be sealed by making a fist. [...] A patient can apply pressure directly to their own wound, if their consciousness level allows. [...] Ideally a barrier, such as sterile, low-adherent gauze should be used between the pressure supplier and the wound, to help reduce chances of infection and help the wound to seal. [...] Third parties assisting a patient are always advised to use protective latex or nitrile medical gloves to reduce risk of infection or contamination passing either way. [...] Direct pressure can be used with some foreign objects protruding from a wound; padding is applied from each side of the object to push in and seal the wound - objects are never removed.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>fist</b> fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still {{want to play with}} you’. Bottum did the same thing.

In the confusion, Corporal Punishment entered the ring, attacked the Ultimate Comet, and was able to pin O'Malley by the time the referee came to. At the end of the match, fellow referee Jeff Jones confronted Dave the Wave and berated him on the outcome of the match. Their argument escalated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-blown <b>fist</b> fight which had to be broken up by Axl Rotten, Dr. Pain and the Ultimate Comet, the three sending Jones back to the locker room and setting up a [...] "referee vs. referee" [...] match between the two men.|$|R

Later, Cate heads to the Dumas' château located in the German Alps. While there, she is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cell. The Baroness gloats at Cate about her plans to take over the world and leaves. Cate then provokes Armstrong <b>into</b> <b>an</b> ensuing <b>fist</b> fight.

50|$|At {{the start}} of the war the only grenade in service with the army was the No 1 Grenade. Because of the {{problems}} associated with it, the Jam Tin Grenade was designed. It contained an inner can of explosive with an outer can of metal fragments or ball bearings. The fuses that were developed for the Jam Tin Grenade were activated by friction or a by lighted taper which was often replaced by a lighted cigarette. This was followed by the highly successful Mills bomb in 1915. It was oval in shape to fit <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clenched <b>fist</b> and time fused. The detonator was activated by a spring driven firing pin which was restrained by a lever that in turn was locked by a safety pin. The Mills bomb was a defensive grenade. After throwing the user had to take cover immediately and a competent thrower could manage 20 yd with reasonable accuracy. Adopted as the standard grenade, over 33 million Mills bombs were produced in the final three years of the war.|$|R

He had found that he was very much like other men after all, and the imminent loss of part of his anatomy had scraped off twenty years of culture. Gambling without stakes is an insipid amusement, and Corliss discovered, likewise, that the warm blood which rises from hygienic gymnasium work is something quite different from that which pounds hotly along when thew matches thew and flesh impacts on flesh and the stake is life and limb. As he dragged himself to his feet by means of the bar-rail, he saw a man in a squirrel-skin parka lift a beer-mug to hurl at Trethaway, a couple of paces off. And the fingers, which were more used to test-tubes and water colors, doubled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>fist</b> which smote the mug-thrower cleanly on the point of the jaw.
