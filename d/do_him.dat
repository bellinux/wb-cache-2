25|$|In June 1905, Fra Pio's health worsened to such {{an extent}} that his {{superiors}} decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would <b>do</b> <b>him</b> some good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return to his home town. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On January 27, 1907, he still made his solemn profession.|$|E
25|$|Marillier's {{international}} stats do not <b>do</b> <b>him</b> justice really; he averages 31 in Tests {{with two}} fifties, {{although it has}} to be said both came against Bangladesh, and in ODIs his batting average is only 18 (but he can be a match winner on his day) and 41 with the ball, with 30 wickets. In first-class cricket Marillier averages 37 with 6 hundreds and 13 fifties. With the ball he averages 37 with 46 wickets.|$|E

25|$|The interregnum, {{the final}} four years of Charles' life, was more {{peaceful}} than most of it had been and {{much of his time}} was now spent on administrative and organisational plans to create a more efficient state. Though, in 738, he compelled the Saxons of Westphalia to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> homage and pay tribute, and in 739 checked an uprising in Provence, the rebels being under the leadership of Maurontus. Charles set about integrating the outlying realms of his empire into the Frankish church.|$|E
25|$|After {{subjecting}} Babylon to tribute, defeating Urartu and conquering the Medes, Persians and Neo-Hittites, Tiglath-Pileser III {{directed his}} armies into Aramea, of which large swathes had regained independence, and the commercially successful Mediterranean seaports of Phoenicia. He took Arpad near Aleppo in 740 BC after a siege of three years, and razed Hamath. Azariah, king of Judah {{had been an}} ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-Pileser to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> homage and pay yearly tribute.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of his public service career, which began in 1998 with his first-time {{candidacy}} for President of the Republic, Noboa has been the object of multiple denunciations and labor- and tax- related allegations, as well as political and personal, ideological attacks, by what he describes as powerful and influential political and commercial adversaries from within the country who wish to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> harm via a permanent smear campaign aimed at denigrating his honor and that of his family, thereby evading his fight against corruption on behalf of the poor and undermining his aim to transform Ecuador into a developed country.|$|E

25|$|The {{battalion}} formed part of {{the garrison}} during the Siege of Valenciennes which lasted from 25 May to 27 July 1793. The French defenders led by Jean Ferrand surrendered to the Coalition army under Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany after 1,000 soldiers were killed or died of sickness out of 9,800 troops. The survivors were released on the promise not {{to fight against the}} Coalition army for one year. As the French troops marched out of the city to lay down their arms they were set upon by the inhabitants of Valenciennes who then raised the Bourbon flag. Léchelle protected the representative Charles Cochon de Lapparent when the civilians threatened to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> harm, and Cochon secured his appointment as general of brigade on 17 August 1793. In any case, Léchelle earned the promotion by displaying courage and persistence during the defense of Valenciennes.|$|E
25|$|September {{began with}} an {{impressive}} pitching duel between Clayton Kershaw and Roy Oswalt. Kershaw struck out 11 batters but allowed two solo home runs {{and that was enough}} to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> in. Oswalt took a no-hitter into the sixth inning as the Phillies closed out the series with a 5–1 victory. The rival San Francisco Giants came to Dodger Stadium for the next series. Chad Billingsley welcomed them to town by throwing a two-hitter for eight innings and hitting a two-run single for the decisive runs in the Dodgers 4–2 victory. In the second game, Ted Lilly pitched a one-hitter through six innings and Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer to stake the Dodgers to a 4–0 lead. However, the bullpen imploded again and Jonathan Broxton blew his sixth save of the season when Juan Uribe hit a two-run homer off him for a 5–4 Giants win.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic {{reaction}} towards magic did not condemn {{magic in}} general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and possession, and sorcery. Magic is therefore a special gift from God, while the latter is achieved through help of Jinn and devils. Ibn al-Nadim hold, Exorcists gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobidience and sacrifices and they in return <b>do</b> <b>him</b> a favor. Being pious and strictly follow {{the teachings of the}} Quran can increase the probability to perform magic or miracles. According to Ibn Arabi Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli was due to his piety able to walk on water. Based on the Quran, regarding islamic legends of Solomon, magic was taught by devils to the humans. Solomon took the writings of the sorcerer away and hid them under his throne. After his death, Iblis, unable to get close to Solomons court, told the people, they will find a treasure under the throne and thus lead them to sorcery. Another account hold, sorcery came with the fallen angels Harut and Marut to mankind.|$|E

25|$|Cassius Dio {{wrote that}} Caesar {{secretly}} set Publius Clodius Pulcher against Cicero {{because of his}} suspicions about the Vettius affair. He considered Cicero a dangerous enemy. He did so when he ascertained that Clodius would to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> a favour in return for not testifying against {{him when he was}} tried for sacrilege three years earlier (see above). However, Clodius did not need to owe anything to Caesar to attack Cicero. He bore a grudge against Cicero because he had testified against him at this trial. In another passage Cassius Dio wrote that after the trial Clodius hated the optimates. Suetonius described Clodius as the enemy of Cicero. Appian wrote that Clodius had already requited Caesar by helping him to secure the governorship of Gaul before Caesar unleashed him against Cicero and that Caesar ‘turned a private grievance to useful account’. Moreover, Clodius was already an ally of Pompey before this. As mentioned in the previous section, Plutarch wrote that Pompey had already allied with Clodius when his attempt to have the acts for his settlements in the east failed before the creation of the triumvirate.|$|E
25|$|In 1413, the Ottoman prince Mehmed I {{ended the}} civil war of the Ottoman Interregnum and {{established}} himself as Sultan and the sole master of the Ottoman realm. In 1414, he campaigned in Anatolia against Junayd of Aydın, {{and when he came}} to Smyrna several of the most important Latin rulers of the Aegean Sea—the Genoese lords of Chios, Phokaia, and Lesbos, and even the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller—came to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> obeisance. One contemporary account by Byzantine historian Doukas (after 1462) reports that the Sultan was enraged that the Duke of Naxos was absent, and as a retaliation he equipped a fleet of 30 vessels, under the command of Çali Bey, and in late 1415 sent it to raid the Cyclades, the domain of the Duke of Naxos. The Ottoman fleet ravaged the islands, and carried off {{a large part of the}} inhabitants of Andros, Paros, and Melos. On the other hand, the Venetian historian Marino Sanuto the Younger (1466–1536) indicates that the Ottoman attack was in retaliation for the raids against Ottoman shipping undertaken by Pietro Zeno, the lord of Andros. Although Zeno was a Venetian citizen and vassal of the Republic of Venice, he had not been included in the previous treaties between the Republic and the Ottomans, and had continued raiding Ottoman shipping on his own account.|$|E
500|$|Alan Clark, in Aces High: The War in the Air Over the Western Front, found Ball the [...] "perfect public schoolboy" [...] with [...] "the enthusiasms and all {{the eager}} {{intelligence}} of that breed" [...] and that these characteristics, coupled {{with a lack of}} worldly maturity, were [...] "the ingredients of a perfect killer, where a smooth transition can be made between the motives that drive a boy to 'play hard' at school and then to 'fight hard' against the King's enemies". Biographer Chaz Bowyer considered that [...] "to label Albert Ball a 'killer' would be to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> a grave injustice", as his [...] "sensitive nature suffered in immediate retrospect whenever he succeeded in combat".|$|E
60|$|True, he says, he {{did them}} no hurt; {{but did he}} do them good?

500|$|In {{a column}} on Broderick's brief {{demotion}} to patrolman in 1934, Westbrook Pegler {{said that the}} demotion would <b>do</b> <b>him</b> some good, that he [...] "was excessively tough at times and there were occasions when, pining for action, he bounced round {{people who were in}} not particular need of bouncing around." [...] Pegler said that Broderick was selective in whom he would harass, that [...] "there were many low characters in the city, notorious for their activity in the rackets, who were walking right past Detective Broderick on the street and in the lobby of [...] Garden, whom he did not find any occasion to bounce around." [...] Pegler said he found that [...] "strange." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{qualified}} as a barrister, Benjamin chose {{to join the}} Northern Circuit, as it included Liverpool, where his connections in New Orleans and knowledge of mercantile affairs would <b>do</b> <b>him</b> the most good. [...] In an early case, he defended two former Confederate agents against a suit by the United States to gain assets said to belong to that nation. Although he lost that case (United States v Wagner) on appeal, he was successful against his former enemies in United States v McRae (1869). He had need of rapid success, as most of his remaining assets {{were lost in the}} collapse of the firm of Overend, Gurney and Company. He was reduced to penning columns on international affairs for The Daily Telegraph.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli's executors {{decided against}} a public {{procession}} and funeral, fearing that too large crowds would gather to <b>do</b> <b>him</b> honour. The chief mourners {{at the service}} at Hughenden on 26 April were his brother Ralph and nephew Coningsby, to whom Hughenden would eventually pass. [...] Queen Victoria was prostrated with grief, and considered ennobling Ralph or Coningsby as a memorial to Disraeli (without children, his titles became extinct with his death) but decided against {{it on the ground}} that their means were too small for a peerage. Protocol forbade her attending Disraeli's funeral (this would not be changed until 1965, when Elizabeth II attended the rites for the former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill) but she sent primroses ("his favourite flowers") to the funeral, and visited the burial vault to place a wreath of china blooms four days later.|$|E
