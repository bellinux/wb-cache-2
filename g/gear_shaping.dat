50|$|The {{process of}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> uses a toothed disk cutter which reciprocates in axial rotations. The {{workpiece}} (or blank gear) rotates {{on a second}} shaft (spindle). The workpiece is aligned with the cutter and it gradually feeds into the cutter while rotating. If a two-step process is used, all tooth spaces are partially cut before finishing.|$|E

50|$|The {{types of}} cutters used for <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> can be grouped into four categories: disk, hub, shank, and helical cutters. The cutters are {{essentially}} gears {{that are used}} to form the teeth. This method of gear cutting is based on the principle that any two gears will mesh if they are of the same pitch, proper helix angle, and proper tooth depth and thickness.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{used for}} <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> {{generally}} {{consists of a}} base, column spindle, and an arbor. The gear cutter is mounted on the spindle, and the gear blank is mounted on the arbor. The cutter reciprocates up and down while the workpiece is gradually fed into the cutter.

40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> tooth <b>shape</b> {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> tooth <b>shape</b> deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus. Therefore, the y-position of the stylus represents the output quantity. Other quantities (stylus x-position, stylus z-position, and gear tooth surface position) represent the input quantities. Accordingly, if we search for a point on the gear tooth surface whose x-coordinate and z-coordinate are equal to x- and z-position of the stylus, the y-coordinate of the gear tooth surface should be equal to the y-position of the stylus. We can apply the Monte Carlo method to this procedure, thus evaluating the <b>gear</b> tooth <b>shape</b> measurement uncertainty. The factors of the uncertainties being considered are shown in Table 1, and the simulation conditions are listed in Table 2.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of splines, {{internal}} and external. External splines may be broached, shaped (for example on a <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> machine), milled, hobbed, rolled, ground or extruded. There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to accessibility restrictions. Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing (no access). Often, with internal splines, the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole, which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method.

Analysis of static technological dimensional pitch size chain of wheels being cut is performed. It was revealed that the most of transmission errors of the wheels, formed by the traditional gear-shaped cutter are caused by manufacturing and installation error of the cutter and result from the formation of each tooth of the wheel with a certain tool. This {{is not the case}} with <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> by step cutter since at that, the profiles of all gear teeth are formed by means of tooth profile mostly remote from the tool rotation axis.

40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> process. <b>Gear</b> <b>shaping</b> is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> machine. To predict cutting forces in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping,</b> the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping,</b> the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in <b>gear</b> <b>shaping.</b> The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an Electronic Helical Guide Controller (EHGC) is proposed, for helical <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> processes. In most {{traditional}} gear shaper machines, the cutter's reciprocating movement {{is driven by}} a crank-connecting rod mechanism. Therefore, this study adopts this kind of gear shaper as the machine platform to establish an accurate mathematical model. The control algorithm {{is embedded in the}} interpolation module of the CNC system using electronic gearbox techniques to realize special multi-axis linkage control requirements. The crankshaft's angular position is measured and the rotational speed is calculated in each control cycle. The actual position and velocity of the cutter along the Z-axis can be calculated using the geometric relations of the crank-connecting mechanism, and motion in the other axes can be controlled by the electronic gearbox. A special G code with parameters (G 83) is also designed and the EHGC control through NC programming is realized in an improvised <b>gear</b> <b>shaping</b> CNC machine. The proposed EHGC is low cost and easy to implement in practice since it does not need a linear grating ruler and a probe on the Z-axis. Furthermore, EHGC allows the flexibility to change a part's helix angle to compensate for distortions caused by heat treatment. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EHGC...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} <b>gear</b> <b>shape.</b> <b>Gears</b> are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R
