40|$|An energy {{efficient}} thermo-siphon method of defrosting the air coils {{on a commercial}} half glass door (HGD) /well retail display cabinet has been developed (FrigescoTM) and the performance compared with the existing <b>electric</b> <b>defrost</b> system under EN ISO 23953 test room conditions. Previous work by (Foster et al, 2013) used a passive thermo-siphon to defrost the top evaporator inside the top (glass door) section and a pump assisted thermo-siphon to defrost the well section. This {{was due to the}} head being too low to adequately defrost the well evaporator with a passive thermo-siphon. This work describes a passive thermo-siphon with no pump. To enable the thermo-siphon to operate efficiently the design of the evaporator was optimised. The thermo-siphon heated quicker and melted water faster than the <b>electric</b> <b>defrost.</b> The thermo-siphon used less electrical heat and had an added benefit of free sub-cooling...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{energy and}} its {{conservation}} {{is a great}} challenge for engineers. All the refrigeration and air conditioning machines consume large amount of electrical energy. To minimize its consumption various technologies are working day and night. As far as government of India is concern, it already started special norms which are standardized by BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency). Energy Standards are becoming more stringent and {{to meet up with}} them it is necessary to make refrigerators more energy efficient. Energy saving can be done either by optimizing subsystem related to cooling or Defrosting. Commercial refrigerated display and storage cabinets normally use one of five defrost method. Condensing unit off permitting natural defrost along with Hot gas <b>defrost,</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>defrost,</b> Water defrost and Other external heat source defrosts. The refrigerators described here are used in supermarkets to display and store perishables products. Focusing here on hot gas defrosts method & its energy benefits over the convention methods like electrical heater method. Main emphasis has been given on defrost cycle of No frost Refrigerator. It is meaningful to note that the defrost efficiency is compressor discharge temperature by optimizeding discharge temperature...|$|R
40|$|An energy {{efficient}} method of defrosting the evaporator on a frozen retail display cabinet {{was developed and}} its performance {{compared with that of}} the existing <b>electric</b> <b>defrost.</b> The cabinet was modified so that either defrost system could be deployed, leaving the rest of the system operation untouched. Performance of the cabinet during EN 23953 standard tests was compared. Total energy consumption during the tests was 40 % lower with the novel defrost. This was partly due to elimination of the use of electrical defrost power (which reduced direct electrical power by 39 %). Since the system leads to lower liquid refrigerant temperatures at the expansion valve there is a saving in compressor power for the same refrigeration effect and as the defrost is quicker, the temperature excursions inside the cabinet are smaller, reducing the amount of heat which has to be removed after a defrost. The cabinet can also be run at a higher evaporating temperature, further reducing energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} defrost performance {{issues associated}} with a finned-tube air chiller, utilised as a heat exchanger in an indirect multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, where a glycol antifreeze mixture is deployed as a secondary working fluid. Two approaches to defrost are examined: a direct <b>electric</b> <b>defrost</b> mode which effects defrost by localised resistance heating of the secondary working fluid; and a hot gas primary circuit, that indirectly heats the secondary working fluid {{by means of a}} primary to secondary heat exchanger. Investigation into the different defrost modes were carried out for chamber set point conditions of - 20, - 12, 0 oC, for a number of defrost rated inputs between 0. 5 and 3. 9 kW. For a unit mass of frost, the duration of defrost was found to be inversely proportional to defrost energy input, however this relation was found to be non-linear. Defrost efficiency was found to decrease with defrost energy input, whereas the required specific total energy for defrost was found to increase with defrost energy input...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaporator}} {{test stand}} has been designed, sized, constructed, calibrated and operated {{to investigate the}} evaporator performance degradation for low temperature refrigeration applications. Measurements have been taken of air- and refrigerant-side temperatures, refrigerant-side pressures, air- and refrigerant-side differential pressures, air- and refrigerant-side mass flow rate and the power consumption of the <b>electric</b> <b>defrost</b> heater. The system is designed {{to work as a}} commercial refrigeration system for low temperature applications including freezing and defrost cycles. A manual and automatic defrost control has been designed and tested. The calculated values are the air- and refrigerant-side capacities. The tests have shown that the system is able to accomplish all desired test conditions. The performance of the evaporator was evaluated continuously during testing. Its performance degraded constantly by accumulation of frost during each frosting cycle, which resulted in the loss of superheat towards the end of each cycle. The defrost operation could not restore the full capacity of the evaporator. The defrost cycle consists out of two phases, melting the ice and re-cooling the coil. The first phase melts all the ice of the coil but the drainage of the resulting water is incomplete. The re-cooling phase freezes the amount of water residue on the evaporator coil, which causes an accelerated frost formation in the following freezing cycle. All over this behavior causes an accelerated reduction in evaporator capacity and therefore earlier superheat loss. It has been investigated for two air flow rates. The comparison of cycles with different air flow rates showed that with an increased air flow rate the frost density increases and the free flow area of the air passage in the evaporator decreases more slowly...|$|R
