40|$|In the {{standard}} specification of ac dielectric-characteristic measurements of insulating materials, test voltage is prescribed as "approximately sinusoidal" when the highest acceptable deviation of the HV waveform, from the correct sinusoidal shape, {{is limited to}} a ± 5 % tolerance range of the crest factor value. In the field of partial discharge (PD) measurements and their statistical data processing, on which forecasts of long term behavior of components and their reliability are currently carried out, the results of elaborations depend on the voltage wave shape. In this paper, the errors in PD measurements, evaluated at <b>industrial</b> <b>frequencies,</b> due to applied voltages distorted by 3 rd and 5 th harmonics, are studied. The analysis is carried out by comparing the main characteristic parameters of PD, in the distorted steady state, with those occurring under the sinusoidal steady state.

Stochastic and statistical analysis and parameter's curves, applied to a few of possible PD markers, show the differences in the measurements, when these are obtained as function of harmonic content percent and phase angle. Moreover it is emphasised that crest factor does not completely account for errors in PD pattern evaluation...|$|R

50|$|Moving iron {{ammeters}} use a {{piece of}} iron which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a fixed coil of wire. The moving-iron meter was invented by Austrian engineer Friedrich Drexler in 1884. This type of meter responds to both direct and alternating currents (as opposed to the moving-coil ammeter, which works on direct current only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel {{each other and the}} moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical springs. The deflection of a moving iron meter is proportional to the square of the current. Consequently, such meters would normally have a non linear scale, but the iron parts are usually modified in shape to make the scale fairly linear over most of its range. Moving iron instruments indicate the RMS value of any AC waveform applied. Moving iron ammeters are commonly used to measure current in <b>industrial</b> <b>frequency</b> AC circuits.|$|E

5000|$|Generally two {{separate}} overhead wires are used, with the rail {{for the third}} phase, though occasionally three overhead wires are used. At junctions, crossovers and crossings the two lines must be kept apart, with a continuous supply to the locomotive, which must have two live conductors wherever it stops. Hence two collectors per overhead phase are used, but the possibility of bridging a dead section and causing a short circuit from the front collector of one phase to the back collector of the other phase must be avoided. The resistance of the rails used for the third phase or return is higher for AC than for DC because of the [...] "skin" [...] effect, but lower for the low frequency used than for <b>industrial</b> <b>frequency.</b> Losses are also increased, though {{not in the same}} proportion, as the impedance is largely reactive.The locomotive needs to pick up power from two (or three) overhead conductors. Early locomotives on the Italian State Railways used a wide bow collector which covered both wires but later locomotives used two pantographs side by side. In the United States, a pair of trolley poles were used. They worked well with a maximum speed of 15 mph. The dual conductor pantograph system is used on four mountain railways that continue to use three-phase power (Corcovado Rack Railway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jungfraubahn and Gornergratbahn in Switzerland and the Petit train de la Rhune in France).|$|E

For the common <b>industrial</b> <b>frequencies</b> of tens of MHz, and for typical pressures of few Pascals, the power deposition occurs mostly {{at the edge of}} the discharge. In these conditions, ionization and electron heating occur in a layer close to the chamber walls, where a consistent fraction of the plasma is rapidly lost by diffusion toward the surface. The remaining fraction of plasma diffuses inward toward the center of the discharge, setting up a uniform and almost flat density profile, used in applications. A one-dimensional model considering both the plasma-wave coupling of the electrons with the RF wave and the macroscopic transport of ions and neutrals along the radial dimension of a cylindrical processing chamber has been derived and used to evaluate the profiles at equilibrium. The model has been validated through Langmuir probe measurements in helicon processing chambers. The numerical model has then been used to study the power-coupling behavior of the discharge when the pressure of the neutral gas is decreased. When the Knudsen number of the neutral gas approaches unity and in conditions of slightly magnetized discharge, the power deposition shifts from being edge-localized to center-localized, thus reducing the particle fluxes toward the walls and increasing the efficiency of the coupling...|$|R
