5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary <b>eye</b> <b>irritant</b> to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
25|$|As an oxidant, {{silver nitrate}} should be {{properly}} stored away from organic compounds. Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nose bleeds, silver nitrate {{is still very}} much toxic and corrosive. Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects other than the purple, brown or black stains on the skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate is known to be a skin and <b>eye</b> <b>irritant.</b> Silver nitrate has not been thoroughly investigated for potential carcinogenic effect.|$|E

It consisted of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), {{as well as a}} cautionary <b>eye</b> <b>irritant</b> and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately one [...] million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps.|$|E

Among {{a long list}} of substances, these three have become of greater importance than the others because of their effectiveness and low risks when used. Today, CS has largely replaced CN as the most widely used tear gas internationally.|$|R
500|$|Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; Degussa) became sole {{owners of}} Degesch in 1922. There, {{beginning}} in 1922, , Bruno Tesch, and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters {{along with a}} cautionary <b>eye</b> <b>irritant</b> and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application (number DE 438818) dated 20 June 1922. The German Patent Office awarded the patent on 27 December 1926. Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. Customs facilities along the Mexican border to disinfect the clothing of [...] border crossers.|$|E

It was banned after a similar product was used by Germany as a chemical weapon in World War I. In 1922, Degesch was purchased by Degussa, where a team of chemists that included [...] and Bruno Tesch developed a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary <b>eye</b> <b>irritant</b> and adsorbent stabilizers. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included delousing clothing and disinfesting ships, warehouses, and trains.|$|E

40|$|To reduce and/or {{replace the}} Draize test, testing schemes {{combining}} strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed during a 2005 ECVAM expert meeting. The testing scheme proposes, based on expected irritancy {{of the test}} substance, a Bottom-Up approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify non-irritants, or a Top-Down approach, beginning with test methods that accurately identify severe irritants before progression of further in vitro testing. Furthermore as its core activity, ECVAM participated in the retrospective validation of and has peer reviewed scientific validity of four organotypic assays, and undertook retrospective validation of four cell function/cytotoxicity assays. The BCOP and ICE organotypic assays were ICCVAM and ESAC endorsed as scientifically valid for identifying severe irritants, and OECD Test Guidelines are under adoption. NRR, FL and CM cell function/cytotoxicity assays were recommended by an ECVAM Validation Management Group for identification of non-irritants or severe <b>eye</b> <b>irritants</b> in the Bottom-Up/Top-Down approaches. These assays were peer reviewed by ESAC during 2009. Finally, a joint ECVAM-COLIPA prospective validation study was initiated in 2008 to evaluate two Reconstructed human Tissue assays to discriminate non-classified materials from <b>eye</b> <b>irritants,</b> based on the proposed test strategies. The {{ultimate goal is to}} combine validated in vitro assays, based on their performances and applicability domains, to define the most suitable testing strategy to classify substances for eye irritation potential and ultimately replace the Draize test.

40|$|Synopsis [...] An anti-irritant {{is defined}} as an agent which, when used in {{conjunction}} with skin or <b>eye</b> <b>irritants,</b> reduces their irritation potential sufficiently to be tolerated when applied to the body. Three different mechanisms are postulated for the activity shown by various anti-irritants: Some operate by "complexing " the irritant itself. Others react with the skin, blocking reactive sites so that the irritant cannot react with it. A final group seems nonreactive and apparently protects by merely preventing complete physical contact between irritant and skin. Examples of each mode of action are given. The major portion of the report presents irritation test data showing specific anti-irritant activity, or lack thereof, for a number of agents which were added to various types of cosmetic formulas. In particular, an antiperspirant formula is developed step-by-step, with the irritant effect of each component determined.
