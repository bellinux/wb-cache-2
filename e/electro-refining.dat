50|$|Electrometallurgy {{involves}} metallurgical {{processes that}} take place in some form of electrolytic cell. The most common types of electrometallurgical processes are electrowinning and <b>electro-refining.</b> Electrowinning is an electrolysis process used to recover metals in aqueous solution, usually as the result of an ore having undergone one or more hydrometallurgical processes. The metal of interest is plated onto the cathode, while the anode is an inert electrical conductor. <b>Electro-refining</b> is used to dissolve an impure metallic anode (typically from a smelting process) and produce a high purity cathode. Fused salt electrolysis is another electrometallurgical process whereby the valuable metal has been dissolved into a molten salt which acts as the electrolyte, and the valuable metal collects on the cathode of the cell. The fused salt electrolysis process is conducted at temperatures sufficient to keep both the electrolyte and the metal being produced in the molten state. The scope of electrometallurgy has significant overlap with the areas of hydrometallurgy and (in the case of fused salt electrolysis) pyrometallurgy. Additionally, electrochemical phenomena play a considerable role in many mineral processing and hydrometallurgical processes.|$|E
50|$|The smelter smelts {{the copper}} {{concentrate}} mixed with silica in the Isasmelt furnace. The product from the ISA furnace is matte and slag which {{goes to the}} Matte Settling Electric Furnace. Slag is tapped out and discarded. Matte is tapped out and taken to the PS converters for further processing to blister copper. The blister copper is then further processed in Anode furnaces and, thereafter, the copper is cast into anodes in a twin casting wheel. The anodes are then sent to the refinery for <b>electro-refining.</b>|$|E

In this study, tin <b>electro-refining</b> process was performed to purify the casted tin crude metal at various experimental conditions: at the current density of 3, 5 A/dm 2, and in various electrolytes such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and methansulfonic acid.

Quantitative analysis on casted tin crude metal showed that it consists of tin with 93. 9 wt. % and several impurity metals of Ag, Bi, Pb, Cu, and etc. After tin <b>electro-refining</b> process, the purity of tin increased up to 99. 985 wt. %...|$|E
25|$|The International Nickel Company (now Vale) {{has long}} {{been one of the}} city's main employers, since the opening of a {{refinery}} in 1918. Taking advantage of inexpensive hydroelectricity from generating stations at nearby Niagara Falls, the refinery produced <b>electro-refined</b> nickel for the war effort, and grew to employ over 2,000 workers by the 1950s.

50|$|In the refinery, copper anodes {{coming from}} the smelter are <b>electro-refined</b> to produce cathodes having 99.99% Cu and {{conforming}} to LME grade A. This is done by putting anodes and cathodes alternately in a cell, in which copper sulphate electrolyte solution is circulated and current is passed. Copper ions thus generated from anodes move towards cathode and get deposited on starter plates cathodes. The cathode plates are taken out from the cells at a certain interval. The cathodes thus produced are bundled and are mostly exported.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} spall {{experiments}} {{has been completed}} with thin depleted uranium targets, nominally 0. 1 mm thick. The first set of uranium spall targets was cut and ground to final thickness from <b>electro-refined,</b> high-purity, cast uranium. The second set was rolled to final thickness from low purity uranium. The impactors for these experiments were laser-launched 0. 05 -mm thick copper flyers, 3 mm in diameter. Laser energies were varied to yield a range of flyer impact velocities. This resulted in varying degrees of damage to the uranium spall targets, from deformation to complete spall or separation at the higher velocities. Dynamic measurements of the uranium target free surface velocities were obtained with dual velocity interferometers. Uranium targets were recovered and sectioned after testing. Free surface velocity profiles were similar for {{the two types of}} uranium, but spall strengths (estimated from the magnitude of the pull-back signal) are higher for the high-purity cast uranium.

40|$|<b>Electro-{{refining}},</b> {{a method}} for refining and reprocessing metals, requires an electrolytic solution to…. Using molten LiCl-KCl salt as the electrolyte, a dendritic mixture of corrosive molten salts and purified metals is produced. Before the metals can be recycled, they must first {{be separated from the}} salts. Current <b>electro-refining</b> processes incorporate liquid-vapor separation techniques, where the salts are distilled from the mixture. Containment materials for this process are paramount; the containment crucibles must not only be able to withstand temperatures approaching 1500 oC, but also be resistant to corrosive breakdown by molten salt. Thermally and chemically stable oxides (alumina, zirconia, and yttria) were selected as the most viable material systems for prolonged exposure to the corrosive environment. Each oxide was placed in contact with 30 wt% LiCl-KCl/ 70 wt% copper at temperatures approaching 1500 oC for up to 40 hours. The oxides were then analyzed for corrosion products, surface reactions, and penetration depth using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Preliminary XRD characterization demonstrated that for short durations, zirconia is immune to chemical attack by molten LiCl-KCl, whereas alumina suffered extensive surface corrosion...|$|E

The diffusion coefficient was calculated according to Levich’s expression from measurements of limiting current for different rotating speed of the RDE.

40|$|The metal {{zirconium}} (Zr) and its related alloys {{have high}} melting points {{and an excellent}} resistance to corrosion. Consequently, zirconium is applied in chemical technology and particularly in nuclear reactors. The low neutron-capture cross-section of zirconium, combined with its corrosive resistance, make the metal pre-eminently suitable as cladding for nuclear fuel rods. In nature, zirconium is nearly always found in combination with hafnium (Hf). Chemically the metals zirconium and hafnium strongly resemble each other. However, contrary to zirconium, hafnium has a high neutron-capture cross-section. As a low absorption coefficient for neutrons is essential for fuel rod cladding, the hafnium content of nuclear-grade zirconium should be as low as possible. Currently, most of the world’s zirconium is produced by the Kroll method. This process is over sixty years old, and due to its inefficient batch production the production costs are high. A (semi-) continuous molten salt <b>electro-refining</b> process {{could result in a}} cheaper, purer product that still meets the high requirements of the industry. A new process for the production of pure zirconium has been recently developed and patented at Delft University of Technology. In the current work, fundamental operating aspects of the patented process have been investigated. The patented process consists of three steps. The first step is the reduction of ZrO 2 and HfO 2 to Zr and Hf metal. For this step, the solubility of ZrO 2 in molten salt has been investigated. Different salt compositions, additives and temperatures have been used. The best results were found using an equimolar NaCl-CaCl 2 mixture with 5 mol% CaO and 5 mol% NaF added, at a temperature of 750 °C. This resulted in a ZrO 2 solubility of 2. 86 %. The second step is the separation of hafnium from zirconium. By contacting a molten Cu-Sn-Zr-Hf alloy with a CuCl 2 -containing salt, the hafnium is transported to the salt phase. The effects of different salt compositions at different stoichiometric ratios have been investigated. The best results were obtained with a NaCl-CaCl 2 -CuCl 2 salt mixture at a stoichiometric ratio of 1. 5, reaching single-step removal efficiencies of 95 %. Higher CuCl 2 concentrations in the molten salt {{have a positive effect on}} the removal efficiency. The final step is the <b>electro-refining</b> of zirconium from the Cu-Sn-Zr alloy, which has been tested on a laboratory scale. The best results were obtained using vitreous carbon anode lead, a zirconium block cathode and a molten salt electrolyte consisting of equimolar NaCl-KCl with CuCl 2. It is essential that the molten salt electrolyte is purified with hydrochloric gas to remove oxide and hydroxide ions. A dense metallic deposit was formed, which consisted of ~ 25 wt% Cu, ~ 28 wt% Zr and ~ 47 wt% Sn. The applied potential was too high for selective refining of zirconium. Future experiments should use a lower potential, and have a sufficiently high concentration of zirconium in the molten alloy in order to prevent the deposition of tin and copper.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{faces the}} task of {{decommissioning}} much of the vast US weapons complex. One challenge of this effort includes the disposition of large amounts of radioactively contaminated scrap metal (RSM) including {{but not limited to}} steel, nickel, copper, and aluminum. The decontamination and recycling of RSM has become a key element in the DOE's strategy for cleanup of contaminated sites and facilities. Recycling helps to offset the cost of decommissioning and saves valuable space in the waste disposal facilities. It also reduces the amount of environmental effects associated with mining new metals. Work on this project is geared toward finding decontamination and/or recycling alternatives for the RSM contained in the decommissioned gaseous diffusion plants including approximately 40, 000 tons of nickel. The nickel is contaminated with Technetium- 99, and is difficult to remove using traditional decontamination technologies. The project, titled ``Advanced Technologies for Decontamination and Conversion of Scrap Metal'' was proposed as a four phase project. Phase 1 and 2 are complete and Phase 3 will complete May 31, 1999. Stainless steel made from contaminated nickel barrier was successfully produced in Phase 1. An economic evaluation was performed and a market study of potential products from the recycled metal was completed. Inducto-slag refining, after extensive testing, was eliminated as an alternative to remove technetium contamination from nickel. Phase 2 included successful lab scale and pilot scale demonstrations of electrorefining to separate technetium from nickel. This effort included a survey of available technologies to detect technetium in volumetrically contaminated metals. A new process to make sanitary drums from RSM was developed and implemented.

40|$|Copper {{processing}} plants involved in smelting, <b>electro-refining</b> and electro-winning are heat-intensive undertakings that provide extensive challenges for attainment of high energy efficiency. Literature {{has shown that}} most of these plants, especially smelters, operate at low overall energy efficiency due to the seemingly complex energy scenario where heat and electricity as forms of energy are treated distinctively from each other. Many copper {{processing plants}} have not yet explored both available and emerging waste heat recovery technologies hence remain operating at lower energy efficiencies. In the copper processing plants under study in particular the Nchanga tailings leach plant (TLP), plant operators hinted that some of the processes that ought to operate in heated environments operate at ambient temperatures because of lack of a heating mechanism. The project discusses possible heating mechanisms from available local resources and applicable technologies. As the competing options for providing the required heat at the Nchanga TLP present different carbon emission scenarios, the carbon emissions associated to the recommended installations shall be quantified against a suitable baseline. Flue gas waste heat from the nearby Nchanga smelter has been taken as the available local energy source on which the applicable heating scenarios at TLP are analyzed. The project analyzed waste heat scenarios for three furnaces at Nchanga smelter where it has been established that flue gases from the furnaces contain 37. 31 MW of waste heat. Analysis for channeling the waste heat into heat recovery steam generators gave the steam turbine power generation potential of 7. 06 MW. The project also demonstrated how energy efficiency undertakings {{can be used as a}} driver for carbon emission reduction measures and for participation to the available carbon trading mechanisms such as CDM. Selection of suitable baseline scenarios revealed a lot of potential for carbon finance undertakings in the three case study plants. At the Nchanga smelter, the 7. 06 MW power generation capacity has an associated potential of 61, 820 tCO 2 /year emission reductions that can be monetized through the available carbon trading markets. The research established that Nchanga TLP has a heating demand of 10. 87 MW. If this heating demand was to be met by using the smelter waste heat, the undertaking can be taken as CDM activity or other carbon trading platform with an associated potential of 95, 183 tCO 2 /year...|$|E
40|$|Chalcopyrite ore {{forms the}} {{significant}} fraction of copper deposits {{in the earth}} crust. However, {{it is also the}} most difficult to treat using conventional ferric leaching methods. Smelting and <b>electro-refining</b> are currently the methods used in treating chalcopyrite concentrate obtained from froth flotation. Due to the ever increasing environmental requirements on smelters by the Environmental Protection Agency, new smelters are scarce in the United States. The scarcity of smelters has led to the urgent need to find a novel leaching method for the abundant chalcopyrite deposits in the USA {{and the rest of the}} world. This chapter(one) of the dissertation, therefore, investigated the leaching of chalcopyrite ore at pH 2 using a newly discovered oxidant (peroxodisulfate). Our results show that chalcopyrite leaching using peroxodisulfate follows a surface reaction shrinking core model. The activation energy of chalcopyrite leaching using peroxodisulfate ion was calculated as 41. 1 kJ mol⁻¹. We also report that the leaching of chalcopyrite ore is affected by particle size and that stirring hurts leaching of chalcopyrite. Additionally, we found that peroxodisulfate can produce from sulfuric ions electrochemically. Hydrogen peroxide, permanganate, peroxodisulfate and ferric ions are all strong oxidants that have been researched in production pregnant leach solution (PLS) from chalcopyrite ore leaching. Because, solvent extraction is the next step in the recovery of copper from pregnant leach solutions (PLS). The questions, therefore, arises as to the fate of the organic extractant used in solvent extraction coming in contact with strong oxidant residual in the PLS. In chapter two of the dissertation, we studied the effect of strong oxidant residual in PLS on the degradation of organic extractants during solvent extraction of copper. Exposed organic extractants were analyzed using interfacial tension(IFT), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CG LS. The results obtained from IFT and FTIR analysis, show no effect on the organic extractants exposed to sunlight and PLS containing the residual strong oxidant. Finally in chapter 3, the dissertation exams alternative water source for the flotation of chalcopyrite. Mineral flotation is a water-intensive process in mining. In order to sustain mining operations such flotation, which rely heavily on water, chapter 3 of the dissertation looks at using alternative water sources (in this case reclaimed wastewater) in the flotation of chalcopyrite ores; this effort is to limit the mining industries dependence on fresh ground water particularly in the Southwest of United States where water is a scarce commodity. The research studied the effect of reclaimed waste water on chalcopyrite flotation via contact angle and surface energy measurements. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and flotation tests were used to supplement the findings from contact angle and surface studies. We conclude here that the contact angle of a pure chalcopyrite surface was determined to be 75. 6 degrees. We also found that pure chalcopyrite mineral surface is slightly polar with surface energies γCuFeS 2 ^(LW) = 41. 4 mJ/m² (apolar), γCuFeS 2 ^(AB) = 2. 9 mJ/m² (polar). The high value of the surface energy indicates pure chalcopyrite surface is slightly hydrophobic...|$|E
