The {{semantics}} of vocabulary elements use to {{be defined}} locally with scarce rigorousness and without consideration to shared definitions in other vocabularies, this approach produces a lack in the interoperability between resources.

The solution improves previous initiatives concerning metadata management like Metadata Registries (ISO/IEC, 2006) or other DCMI proposals.

40|$|The Riverview Hospital Suitcases finding aid is a <b>descriptive</b> <b>document</b> {{detailing}} the condition and physical contents of suitcases previously belonging to three mid-twentieth century female psychiatric patients of the Essondale Asylum / Riverview Mental Hospital (RVH) in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The archiving of the Riverview Hospital Suitcases developed {{from a series}} of ethnographic and phenomenologically oriented scholarly projects examining the lived experiences of women working and living in the Provincial Mental Hospital in British Columbia, (BC) during the peak of the psychiatric institutionalization movement in the mid-twentieth century (Nielsen and Currie, 2008, 2010, 2012). The Riverview Hospital Story films (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3) were originally designed as “art-film” teaching tools for the post-secondary level study of the history of mental health law and policy. As the architect and instructor of the Douglas College Criminology module Canadian Law and the Mentally Disordered Offender, I continued to broaden the historical legal aspects of the course to include the use of a collection of abandoned patient belongings from the same period of institutional life, subsequently referred to as The Riverview Hospital Suitcases. The Suitcase Collection was a further scholarly project whereby three collections of abandoned patient belongings were cataloged, photographed and rehoused following the closure of Riverview Hospital and its volunteer managed ad hoc museum. The academic use of the resources in total, the films and the artifacts, formed a distinctive resource for teaching and learning in psychiatric history. I recognized the pedagogics as much different than traditional teaching on the topic of law and policy, and in criminology more broadly. In making the collection accessible to students, it became apparent that exposure to the collected items had a notable effect on the constructive engagement of students in otherwise remote topics of the “long-ago” mental patient and further, their understanding of the medico-legal practices of the historical asylum hospital. This became the topic of my Doctoral thesis (University of Wales Trinity Saint David) and explored the influence and potential in presenting to learners of law and criminology the tangible evidence of patients as individual persons rather than a homogeneous group of the “insane”. The finding aid provides a specific accounting of the contents of the Riverview Hospital Suitcases. The suitcase collection is historically significant and has value as a research resource for understanding approaches to psychiatric care and the impacts on patients, families and the community. The artifacts are currently in storage with The City of Coquitlam, British Columbia...|$|E

40|$|Manually {{labeling}} {{documents for}} training a text classifier is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, a classifier trained on labeled documents may suffer from overfitting and adaptability problems. Dataless text classification (DLTC) {{has been proposed}} {{as a solution to}} these problems, since it does not require labeled documents. Previous research in DLTC has used explicit semantic analysis of Wikipedia content to measure semantic distance between documents, which is in turn used to classify test documents based on nearest neighbours. The semantic-based DLTC method has a major drawback in that it relies on a large-scale, finely-compiled semantic knowledge base, which is difficult to obtain in many scenarios. In this paper we propose a novel kind of model, descriptive LDA (DescLDA), which performs DLTC with only category description words and unlabeled documents. In DescLDA, the LDA model is assembled with a describing device to infer Dirichlet priors from prior <b>descriptive</b> <b>documents</b> created with category description words. The Dirichlet priors are then used by LDA to induce category-aware latent topics from unlabeled documents. Experimental results with the 20 Newsgroups and RCV 1 datasets show that: (1) our DLTC method is more effective than the semantic-based DLTC baseline method; and (2) the accuracy of our DLTC method is very close to state-of-the-art supervised text classification methods. As neither external knowledge resources nor labeled documents are required, our DLTC method is applicable to a wider range of scenarios...|$|R
50|$|Runway designations {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the magnetic heading changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and <b>descriptive</b> <b>documents.</b> When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators.
