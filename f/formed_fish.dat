40|$|Ecosystems are {{fragmented}} {{by natural}} and anthropogenic processes that affect organism movement and ecosystem dynamics. When a fragmentation restricts predator but not prey movement, then the prey produced {{on one side}} of an ecosystem edge can subsidize predators on the other side. When prey flux is high, predator density on the receiving side increases above that possible by in situ prey productivity, and when low, the formerly subsidized predators can impose strong top-down control of in situ prey-in situ prey experience apparent competition from the subsidy. If predators feed on some evolutionary clades of in situ prey over others, then subsidy-derived apparent competition will induce phylogenetic structure in prey composition. Dams fragment the serial nature of river ecosystems by prohibiting movement of organisms and restricting flowing water. In the river tailwater just below a large central Mexican dam, fish density was high and fish gorged on reservoir-derived zooplankton. When the dam was closed, water flow and the zooplankton subsidy ceased, densely packed pools of fish <b>formed,</b> <b>fish</b> switched to feed on in situ prey, and the tailwater macroinvertebrate community was phylogenetic structured. We derived expectations of structure from trait-based community assembly models based on macroinvertebrate body size, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and fish-diet selectivity. The diet-selectivity model best fit the observed tailwater phylogenetic structure. Thus, apparent competition from subsidies phylogenetically structures prey communities, and serial variation in phylogenetic community structure can be indicative of fragmentation in formerly continuous ecosystems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Efficacious {{vaccines}} {{were developed}} for the control of Vibrio anguillarum, the etiological agent of vibriosis in salmonid fish. These bacterins can be administered either orally or parenterally. It was determined that both formalin-killed lyophilized whole cells and wet-packed whole cells of the organism are effective oral immunogens. Intraperitoneal injection of 0. 1 ml containing 2 X 10 ⁸ formalinkilled bacterial cells suspended in saline and mixed with Freund complete adjuvant is capable of providing protection to fish exposed to natural challenge with V. anguillarum. Oral vaccines prepared from organisms isolated from salmonids in the Pacific Northwest offered greater immunity than bacterins made from European strains when fish receiving them were challenged at Lint Slough, Waldport, Oregon. Several parameters under which the oral vaccine can be effectively used were examined. These investigations revealed that protection is provided to fish vaccinated for 15 days with a ration containing 0. 5 mg of the wet whole cell vaccine per gram. Increasing {{the number of days}} the vaccine was fed to as many as 45 days did not increase the degree of resistance in immunized fish. Decreased mortality was also not observed in groups of fish fed a diet containing higher concentrations of vaccine. These studies demonstrated that oral immunization of fish can be successfully accomplished at water temperatures ranging from 4 to 21 C. Although agglutinating antibody could not be detected in the serum of orally immunized animals, there is an indication that bactericidal antibodies are <b>formed.</b> <b>Fish</b> parenterally vaccinated produced agglutinating as well as bactericidal antibodies...|$|E
