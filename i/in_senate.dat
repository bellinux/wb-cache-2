5|$|Today {{the main}} {{building}} contains the University of London's Central Academic Bodies and activities, including {{the offices of the}} Vice-Chancellor of the University, the entire collection of the Senate House Library, and seven of the nine research institutes of the School of Advanced Study. During the Second World War, the building's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two noted English writers. Graham Greene's novel The Ministry of Fear (1943) and its film adaptation Ministry of Fear by Fritz Lang (1944) set in Bloomsbury. George Orwell's wife Eileen worked <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired the description of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|Van Zandt, {{though he}} {{personally}} favored annexation by the United States, was {{not authorized to}} entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{resignation}} in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who {{had been}} elected governor of New Hampshire, left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature. With Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce {{was elected to the}} full term, to commence in March 1837, becoming at age 32 one of the youngest members <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> history to that point. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring a sinecure as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.|$|E

25|$|The 1940s {{started an}} era of key {{committee}} chairmanships for Hayden. Due to declining health of Kenneth McKellar, Hayden periodically served as acting chairman of the Appropriations committee during the 1940s and the 1950s. This activity included {{a significant amount of}} behind the scenes work with the committee's ranking Republican, Senator Styles Bridges, and enhanced Hayden's reputation for operating <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> cloakrooms. Starting with the 81st Congress, Hayden became chairman of the Senate Rules Committee.|$|E
25|$|The Mega Borg spill brought {{attention}} to the 984 protocols, legislation that has been held up <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> since 1985. The Protocols passed the House, but have not been ratified due to arguments over international liabilities {{and whether or not}} the US should join international funding groups for oil spills. If ratified, the protocols would do a number of things, including creating multiple new federal response teams, creating a new fleet of special containment booms and skimmers.|$|E

Senate Republicans did not then schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation, not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.|$|E

His prewar fund for ASTRA's public libraries, comprising 25,000 Kronen in 1914, was supplemented by the Transylvania's Directing Council and put to use in 1920.

25|$|During World War I, Zamfir Arbore {{provoked}} controversy when {{he supported}} a Romanian {{alliance with the}} Central Powers, justified in his opinion by a need to liberate Bessarabia.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of , a group of {{officers}} commanding about 3,000 men assembled <b>in</b> <b>Senate</b> Square, where they refused to swear allegiance to the new tsar, NicholasI, proclaiming instead their loyalty to Constantine and their Decembrist Constitution. They expected {{to be joined by}} the rest of the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg, but they were disappointed. The revolt was further hampered when it was deserted by its supposed leader Prince Trubetskoy, who had a last-minute change of heart, and failed to turn up at the Square. His second-in-command, Colonel Bulatov, also vanished from the scene. After a hurried consultation, the rebels appointed Prince Eugene Obolensky as a replacement leader.|$|E
