5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

6000|$|Above me, hark! {{the long}} and maniac cry [...] Of minds and bodies in captivity. [...] And hark! the lash and the {{increasing}} howl, [...] And the half-inarticulate blasphemy! [...] There be some here with worse than frenzy foul, [...] Some who do still goad on the o'er-laboured mind, [...] 70 [...] And dim the little light that's left behind [...] With needless torture, as their tyrant Will [...] <b>Is</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> to the lust of doing ill:[181] [...] With these and with their victims am I classed, [...] 'Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed; [...] 'Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close: [...] So let it be--for then I shall repose.|$|R
500|$|Although {{all four}} members contributed to songwriting and vocals {{on the first}} album, Chilton and Bell {{dominated}} as a duo intentionally modeled on John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album was recorded by Ardent founder John Fry, with Terry Manning contributing occasional backing vocals and keyboards. The title #1Record was decided {{towards the end of}} the recording sessions and evinced, albeit as a playful hope rather than a serious expectation, the chart position to be achieved by a big star. Although Fry—at the band's insistence—was credited as [...] "executive producer", publicly he insisted that [...] "the band themselves really produced these records". Fry recalled how Ardent, one of the first recording studios to use a sixteen-track tape machine, worked experimentally with the band members: [...] "We started recording the songs with the intent that if it turned out OK we'd put it out [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> being the one that primarily worked on it: I recorded all the tracks and then they would often come late at night and do overdubs. One by one, they all learned enough engineering." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{review was}} of Dr Williams' Syllabic Dictionary (Evening Gazette, 16 Sept., 1874), for which I was freely bespattered with abuse from all American quarters. I showed up a {{multiplicity}} of absurd blunders and equally egregious omissions; and <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> with these prophetic words: [...] "We do not hesitate to pronounce Dr Williams the lexicographer, not for the future, but of the past." [...] I at once began upon a dictionary of my own. (Aylmer 1997: 15-16) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good news, indeed. My dame is better, but I {{shall be}} glad {{to get her out}} into the light and air. I will sally out with you at once and look for a lodging, where we may bestow {{ourselves}} until <b>I</b> have <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> my affairs and am ready to start for Flanders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Tiktok, [...] "I am on-ly a ma-chine. But I {{can think}} and speak and act, when <b>I</b> am pro-per-ly <b>wound</b> <b>up.</b> Just now my ac-tion is run down, and Dor-o-thy has {{the key to}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not like}} this dream,--I hate its [...] "foregone conclusion." [...] And am I to be shaken by shadows? Ay, when they remind us of--no matter--but, if I dream thus again, I will try whether all sleep has the like visions. Since I rose, I've been in {{considerable}} bodily pain also; but it is gone, and now, like Lord Ogleby [2], <b>I</b> am <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> for the day.|$|R
2500|$|Thirty-eight {{witnesses}} — {{that was}} the story {{that came from the}} police. And it really is what made the story stick. Over the course of many months of research, <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> finding a document that was a collection of the first interviews. Oddly enough, there were 49 witnesses. I was puzzled by that until I added up the entries themselves. Some of them were interviews with two or three people [...] lived in the same apartment. I believe that some harried civil servant gave that number to the police commissioner who gave it to Rosenthal, and it entered the modern history of America after that.|$|E
2500|$|In a video exposé by The Atlantic, Voris stated {{his belief}} that what had led up to his sexual {{behavior}} could be traced to his mother having bipolar disorder. He stated that in his home life with a bipolar parent [...] "Everything in the environment revolves around that mental illness. <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> believing my parents didn't love me." [...] After {{his mother had been}} diagnosed with stage four cancer, about three months before she died she told Voris, [...] "'I never believed that you were homosexual or gay. I believed that you were acting out in response to the fact of how I had created this situation at home that you didn't {{know how to deal with}} it.'" [...] Voris said that struck him like a hammer.|$|E

5000|$|Demme {{had wanted}} to work with Anne Hathaway ever since he spotted her in a crowd at a {{screening}} five years earlier. He immediately took her in consideration for the lead role. Hathaway later said of her first reading Lumet's script: [...] "I was in my old apartment in the West Village Manhattan, just pacing {{back and forth between the}} kitchen table and the couch. <b>I</b> somehow <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> on the floor sobbing by the last page." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This morning," [...] she said, [...] "it {{seemed to}} me that I saw in one moment an epitome of your life. I saw every nerve of your body strained, <b>I</b> saw you <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> to a great effort. It was to catch a ball! You succeeded, I believe." ...|$|R
60|$|The glad cry died, frozen upon my lips; my arms dropped {{limp and}} lifeless to my sides; {{as one who}} reels beneath the burden of a mortal <b>wound</b> <b>I</b> {{staggered}} <b>up</b> the steps before the throne.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Edward Crimsworth, {{enough of}} this. It is time you and <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> accounts. I have now given your service three months' trial, and I find {{it the most}} nauseous slavery under the sun. Seek another clerk. I stay no longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{carrying}} on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody." [...] Then, before shutting {{her out to}} go, by another passage, to her own place, [...] "I must just wait," [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> for the delivery, I held {{my nerves}} and muscles under {{absolute}} command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed. And then I let go, with {{every ounce of}} my weight and muscle and science in back of that throw. The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon {{the end of the}} nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{can hear}} my squeak, of course," [...] {{answered}} the Alligator. [...] "If no one steps on me I {{might as well}} have no squeak at all. It is now some years since I have listened to the music of my squeak, but each day I have crawled into this path as soon as <b>I</b> was <b>wound</b> <b>up,</b> for <b>I</b> knew that sooner or later someone was sure to walk down the path and tread on me. You look heavier than the Queen, so perhaps I'll squeak louder." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} cut of The Collector ran {{for three}} hours. Because {{of pressure from}} his producers, Wyler was forced to cut the film heavily. This resulted in the complete removal of 35 minutes of prologue material starring Kenneth More. Wyler said, [...] "Some of the finest footage <b>I</b> ever shot <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> on the cutting room floor, including Kenneth's part." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{couple of}} years before the death of Parnell, <b>I</b> had <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> my {{introduction}} to those selections from the Irish novelists with the prophecy of an intellectual movement at the first lull in politics, and now I wished to fulfil my prophecy. I did not put it in that way, for I preferred to think that the sudden emotion that now came to me, the sudden certainty that Ireland was to be like soft wax for years to come, was a moment of supernatural insight. How could I tell, how can I tell even now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{moved my}} place, therefore," [...] Sir Timothy continued, [...] "and I whispered in Mr. Ledsam's ear some rodomontade {{to the effect}} that if he were {{planning}} to be the giant crime-detector of the world, I was by ambition the arch-criminal--or words to that effect. And to give emphasis to my words, <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> by prophesying a crime in the immediate vicinity of the place within a few hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but they}} don't--since, as I tell you, she's even while we talk {{the centre of}} the mystic circle of the twaddle of M. de Dreuil; chained to a stake if you can be. Besides," [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up,</b> [...] "it's not only that she's not the 'right fool'--it's simply that she's not a fool at all. We want the woman who has been {{rendered}} most inane. But this lady hasn't been rendered so in any degree. She's the reverse of inane. She's in full possession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{a day or}} two--really {{to bring}} it out. He'll then be on MY side--of which you see the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only fail, and you will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your arrival in town, {{whatever}} you may have found possible." [...] So I put it before her, but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed that I came again to her aid. [...] "Unless, indeed," [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up,</b> [...] "you really want NOT to go." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cooper {{was terrified}} of sitting in an {{airplane}} (a main plot point) and refused. She also found the director Tom Forman to be a drunk, and was upset that, at her final big scene, he turned up too drunk to direct. [...] When the picture premiered Cooper cried after viewing it, feeling {{it was the worst}} movie she'd ever seen. She wrote [...] "After The Broken Wing, I never wanted to make another picture. After all the times I thought I'd retire for good and then came back to films, <b>I</b> finally <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> my career in a stinker made by a drunk. What a hell of an ending." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] says he, laughing, and {{answering}} {{with the utmost}} readiness, [...] "I thought of nothing at all but of {{getting away from the}} ship as fast as possible, seeing that some hasty fool aboard was blazing away at me with a pistol or musquetoon, and that if I had been picking my course at the time <b>I</b> might have <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> the business with an ounce of lead in my brains, instead of enjoying this pleasant conversation in such good health." ...|$|R
60|$|After an interminable {{string of}} games, we supped, and the artilleryman {{finished}} the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He {{was no longer}} the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more thoughtful optimism. <b>I</b> remember he <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> with my health, proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills.|$|R
60|$|Communications about {{readings}} incessantly come in {{from all}} parts of the country. We take no offer whatever, lying by with our plans until after the first series in New York, and designing, if we make a furore there, to travel as little as possible. I fear I shall have to take Canada at the end of the whole tour. They make such strong representations from Montreal and Toronto, and from Nova Scotia--represented by St. John's and Halifax--of the slight it would be to them, if <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> with the States, that I am shaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} closeted with the manager," [...] I explained. [...] "It {{was one of}} the underwaiters--the little dark one who brought in the coffee. The temptation seems to have been too much for him. He confessed {{directly}} he was questioned. He has restored everything and I thought it best to have him simply turned off without any fuss. Here is your pig, Sir Blaydon; your pendant, Blanche; your brooch, Lady Enterdean. I am exceedingly sorry you should have had any anxiety--but all's well that ends well!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> weakly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know I do--ever so {{much too}} much. And much as I see, I express {{only half of}} it--so you may judge!" [...] I laughed. [...] "But what will you have? I see what I see, and this morning, for a good bit, you did me the honour to do the same. I returned, also, the compliment, didn't I? by seeing {{something}} of what you saw. We put it, the whole thing, together, and we shook the bottle hard. I'm to take from you, after this," [...] <b>I</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up,</b> [...] "that what it contains is a perfectly colourless fluid?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{writer of}} the Slammiversary report on 411 Mania, Colin Rinehart, rated the event an 8 out of 10 which was higher than last year's event that was given 7 out of 10. Rinehart stated, [...] "This show was far better than I was expecting as the card looked solid but unspectacular going in. Every match I {{was looking forward to}} {{delivered}} here though and even some of the matches <b>I</b> wasn't anticipating <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> being pretty good. Throw in some really cool moments like Christian showing up, the Hall of Fame announcement, and the final bump to end the show and this <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> being a pretty damn good show tonight. Easy Thumbs Up." [...] On top of this, Rinehart gave the show a strong 8 out of 10.|$|R
60|$|By {{eleven o'clock}} {{the next morning}} <b>I</b> had <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> my affairs, having {{arranged}} with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to take over such cases as I had, and I was busy in my room packing my saddle-bags for the journey. The warm scents of spring were wafted {{through the open door}} and window, smells of the damp earth giving forth the green things, and tender shades greeted my eyes when I paused and raised my head to think. Purple buds littered the black ground before my door-step, and against the living green of the grass I saw the red stain of a robin's breast as he hopped spasmodically hither and thither, now pausing immovable with his head raised, now tossing triumphantly a wriggling worm from the sod. Suddenly he flew away, and I heard a voice from the street side that brought me stark upright.|$|R
5000|$|... "This Is Your Night" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Dutch-German artist Amber. It was released in May 1996 as the lead single from the album of the same name. The song reached number one in Israel, and had great success in many countries, particularly in Australia, Lebanon, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain. It charted in the top 40 the United States and gained further prominence after appearing in the 1998 American comedy film, A Night at the Roxbury. In the United States pop charts, This <b>Is</b> Your Night <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> only being in the 1996 Year-end chart, although peaking just over number 25 in 1997.|$|R
