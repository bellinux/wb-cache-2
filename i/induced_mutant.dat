40|$|Stem {{fasciation}} is a morphological abnormality {{observed in}} plants where the stem is widened and leaves and flowers or pods are clustered at the apex. Several spontaneous mutants and one <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> for stem fasciation {{are found in}} chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). This study was aimed at determining allelic relationship between spontaneous and <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> genes controlling stem fasciation and effects of stem fasciation on grain yield. Two spontaneous (ICC 2042 and ICC 5645) and one induced (JGM 2) stem fasciation mutants were crossed in all combinations, excluding reciprocals. The F 1 and F 2 plants from a cross between the two spontaneous mutants had fasciated stem. This indicated {{the presence of a}} common gene (designated fas 1) for stem fasciation in the two spontaneous mutants. The F 1 s of the crosses of the <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> JGM 2 with both spontaneous mutants had normal plants and segregated in a ratio of 9 normal: 7 fasciated plants in F 2. Thus, the gene for stem fasciation in the <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> JGM 2 (designated fas 2) is not allelic to the common gene for stem fasciation in spontaneous mutants. The two genes in dominant condition produced normal non-fasciated stem. The fasciated and the non-fasciated F 2 plants did not differ significantly for number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, grain yield per plant and seed size, suggesting {{that it is possible to}} exploit the fasciated trait in chickpea breeding without compromising on yield...|$|E
40|$|Targeted gene {{silencing}} in mammalian cells by RNA interference (RNAi) using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) was recently described by Elbashir et al. (S. M. Elbashir et al., Nature (Lond.), 411 : 494 - 498, 2001). We {{have used this}} methodology in several human cell strains to reduce expression of the Prkdc (DNA-PKcs) gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) that {{is involved in the}} nonhomologous end joining of DNA double-strand breaks. We have also demonstrated a radiosensitization for several phenotypic endpoints of radiation damage. In low-passage normal human fibroblasts, siRNA knock-down of DNA-PKcs resulted in a reduced capacity for restitution of radiation-induced interphase chromosome breaks as measured by premature chromosome condensation, an increased yield of acentric chromosome fragments at the first postirradiation mitosis, and an increased radiosensitivity for cell killing. For three strains of related human lymphoblasts, DNA-PKcs-targeted siRNA transfection resulted in little or no increase in radiosensitivity with respect to cell killing, a 1. 5 -fold decrease in <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> yield in TK 6 - and p 53 -null NH 32 cells, but about a 2 -fold increase in <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> yield in p 53 -mutant WTK 1 cells at both the hypoxanthine quanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) and the thymidine kinase loci...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of mutational {{specificity}} at low doses {{has generally}} not been possible since {{the number of}} <b>induced</b> <b>mutants</b> may be similar or {{significantly lower than the}} spontaneous background. The use of a low-dose fractionated exposure protocol in TK 6 human lymphoblasts results in an incremental accumulation of <b>mutants</b> <b>induced</b> by individual 20 cGy y-ray exposures. Therefore, the frequency of <b>induced</b> <b>mutants</b> within a population at the conclusion of a fractionated exposure regimen is sufficiently elevated to permit the recovery of a low-dose mutant collection.

A few herbicide tolerant genotypes have been developed using non-transgenic approach, primarily through induced mutagenesis, in crops viz., maize, canola, wheat, rice and sunflower (Anderson and Georgeson, 1989; Swanson et al. 1989; Newhouse et al. 1992; Croughan 2002; Shaner et al. 1996; Al-Khatib et al. 1998) though transgenic approach is more prevalent (Green, 2009; Duke and Powles 2009). Imidazolinone herbicides, which include imazapyr, imazapic, imazethapyr, imazamox, imazamethabenz and imazaquin and belong to major class of Group B herbicides, are used commonly in soybean and pulse cultivation but not in rice owing to sensitivity of rice crop to this group of herbicides.

Although protein analyses mostly identify known metabolic enzymes and structural proteins, transcriptome analyses reveal the differential expression of functionally diverse and not yet described genes. The comparative analysis suggests correlation between transcriptional and translational expression for the majority of genes. Significant exceptions from this correlation confirm the complementarities of both approaches.
