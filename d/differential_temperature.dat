The two top thermocouple junctions are at temperature T1 while the two bottom thermocouple junctions are at temperature T2. The output voltage from the thermopile, ΔV, is directly proportional to the temperature differential, ΔT or T1 - T2, across the thermal resistance layer and number of thermocouple junction pairs. The thermopile voltage output is also directly proportional to the heat flux, q", through the thermal resistance layer.|$|E
50|$|Differential thermal {{analysis}} (or DTA) is a thermoanalytic technique. Similar to differential scanning calorimetry. In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference {{are made to}} undergo identical thermal cycles, while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference. This <b>differential</b> <b>temperature</b> is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.|$|E

40|$|Early age thermal {{cracking}} due to <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> {{is one of}} the major issues related to mass concrete construction. <b>Temperature</b> <b>differential</b> is created due to heat of hydration of cement and heat loss from the surface. If induced tensile stresses due to <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> exceed tensile strength of concrete, concrete tends to crack. Current practice in the local construction industry is to limit the <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> to 20 ºC irrespective of the grade of concrete. A Finite Element Model (FEM) was developed using ANSYS to predict early age thermal stress behavior. Appropriate position of thermocouples to measure the <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> in mass concrete was also proposed based on a thermal analysis using FEM.

50|$|STCs for nonpotable {{pool water}} use are often made of plastic. Pool water is mildly {{corrosive}} due to chlorine. Water {{is circulated through}} the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are {{used in conjunction with}} a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple <b>differential</b> <b>temperature</b> controller is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating. Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.|$|E
50|$|Water {{temperatures}} {{vary widely}} on a seasonal basis in polar and temperate habitats, inducing metabolic changes in organisms exposed to these conditions. Seasonal temperature swings {{are even more}} drastic in estuaries than in the open ocean due to the large surface area of shallow water {{as well as the}} <b>differential</b> <b>temperature</b> of ocean and river water. During the summer, rivers are often warmer than the ocean, so there is a gradient of decreasing temperature towards the ocean in an estuary. This switches in the winter, with ocean waters being much warmer than river water, producing the opposite temperature gradient. Temperature is changing on a larger time scale as well, with predicted temperature changes slowly increasing both freshwater and marine water sources (though at variable rates), further enhancing the impact that temperature has on shell deposition processes in estuarine environments.|$|E
50|$|A second {{method of}} {{measuring}} heat flux is {{by using a}} heat flux sensor, or heat flux transducer, to directly measure the amount of heat being transferred to/from the surface that the heat flux sensor is mounted to. The {{most common type of}} heat flux sensor is a <b>differential</b> <b>temperature</b> thermopile which operates on essentially the same principal as the first measurement method that was mentioned except it has the advantage in that the thermal resistance/conductivity {{does not need to be}} a known parameter. These parameters do not have to be known since the heat flux sensor enables an in-situ measurement of the existing heat flux by using the Seebeck-Effect. However, differential thermopile heat flux sensors have to be calibrated in order to relate their output signals μV to heat flux values W/(m2⋅K). Once the heat flux sensor is calibrated it can then be used to directly measure heat flux without requiring the rarely known value of thermal resistance or thermal conductivity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{investigate}} distributed thermal-electrochemical modeling of a Lithium-Ion battery cell {{to include the}} effect of temperature distribution across {{the thickness of the}} cell as a first step to study the module level temperature distribution at high charging rates. Most recent works have focused on lumped thermal models for a Li-Ion cell which ignore any <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> across cell thickness. However, even a small <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> across cell thickness at the cell level can contribute to significant <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> in the thickness direction of stacked-up Li-Ion cells at the module level.
