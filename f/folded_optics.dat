50|$|DMC-TZ: (Travel Zoom) compact, {{point and}} shoot zoom cameras with image stabilization. The TZ1 uses <b>folded</b> <b>optics,</b> with a prism. TZ1's successors use a {{traditional}} design without <b>folded</b> <b>optics,</b> hence the barrel extends further out during operation. The TZ series stands out against other compact digital cameras by achieving a 30x optical zoom with a 24 mm wide angle lens (equivalent to 35 mm camera) in a small, compact body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Folded</b> <b>optics</b> is {{an optical}} {{system in which}} the beam is bent in a way to make the optical path much longer than the size of the system. Prismatic {{binoculars}} are a well-known example.|$|E

50|$|A3 Digital Mapping Camera {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} mirror based optical compensation and stabilization method for all movements potentially affecting image quality (forward motion, sweep motion, and general vibrations of the aircraft). The method uses acceleration sensors, GPS data (for aircraft velocity calculation), and the motor encoders for calculation {{and control of}} the required motion compensation. Both linear and angular compensations are done by tilting the mirror mounted on the <b>folding</b> <b>optics.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{path that}} light takes in {{traversing}} an optical medium or system {{is often called}} the optical path. The physical length of an optical device {{can be reduced to}} less than the length of the optical path by using <b>folded</b> <b>optics.</b> The optical path length as defined in optics is the length of the path multiplied by the index of refraction of the medium.|$|E
5000|$|The Fujifilm FinePix Z-series {{of digital}} cameras {{consists}} of the company's ultra-slim and lightweight point-and-shoot digital cameras. [...] All Z-series camera feature non-protruding <b>folded</b> <b>optics</b> design lenses and sliding lens covers excluding the waterproof Z33WP, which has no lens cover. Early Z-series cameras featured Fujifilm's Super CCD sensor, while later ones use other CCD sensors. Some newer models (Z700EXR, Z800EXR Z900EXR and Z1000EXR) use the EXR-CMOS sensors.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "FinePix Z5 FD" [...] is an ultracompact 6.3 {{megapixel}} {{digital camera}} produced by Fujifilm measuring 92.8(W) × 55.0(H) × 19.4(D)mm (3.6(W) x 2.2(H) x 0.8(D) inch). It is an autofocus camera made in three colors: raspberry red, mocha brown, and silver. In Japan {{it was also}} available in a mix {{of black and white}} colors. As with other Finepix models, the Z5fd was also extensively promoted in Japan by Yuri [...] "Ebi-chan" [...] Ebihara. The camera uses a non-protruding, <b>folded</b> <b>optics</b> design Fujinon 3× zoom lens system (F3.5-F4.2) with a focal length of F6.1-18.3 mm which is equivalent to 36-108 mm on a 35 mm camera.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Classic" [...] Cassegrain has a {{parabolic}} primary mirror, and a hyperbolic {{secondary mirror}} {{that reflects the}} light back down {{through a hole in}} the primary. <b>Folding</b> the <b>optics</b> makes this a compact design. On smaller telescopes, and camera lenses, the secondary is often mounted on an optically flat, optically clear glass plate that closes the telescope tube. This support eliminates the [...] "star-shaped" [...] diffraction effects caused by a straight-vaned support spider. The closed tube stays clean, and the primary is protected, at the cost of some loss of light-gathering power.|$|R
40|$|The Tag, Track and Location System Program (TTL) is {{investigating}} the use of PFTs as tracers for tagging and tracking items of interest or fallen soldiers. In order for the tagging and tracking to be valuable {{there must be a}} location system that can detect the PFTs. This report details the development of an infrared lidar platform for standoff detection of PFTs released into the air from a tagged object or person. Furthering work performed using a table top lidar system in an indoor environment; a mobile mini lidar platform was assembled using an existing Raman lidar platform, a grating tunable CO{sub 2 } IR laser, Judson HgCdTe detector and miscellaneous <b>folding</b> <b>optics</b> and electronics. The lidar achieved {approx} 200 ppb-m sensitivity in laboratory and indoor testing and was then successfully demonstrated at an outdoor test. The lidar system was able to detect PFTs released into a vehicle from a distance of 100 meters. In its final, fully optimized configuration the lidar was capable of repeatedly detecting PFTs in the air released from tagged vehicles. Responses were immediate and clear. This report details the results of a proof-of-concept demonstration for standoff detection of a perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) using infrared lidar. The project is part of the Tag, Track and Location System Program and was performed under a contract with Tracer Detection Technology Corp. with funding from the Office of Naval Research. A lidar capable of detecting PFT releases at distance was assembled by modifying an existing Raman lidar platform by incorporating a grating tunable CO{sub 2 } IR laser, Judson HgCdTe detector and miscellaneous <b>folding</b> <b>optics</b> and electronics. The lidar achieved {approx} 200 ppb-m sensitivity in laboratory and indoor testing and was successfully demonstrated at an outdoor test. The demonstration test (scripted by the sponsor) consisted of three parked cars, two of which were tagged with the PFT. The cars were located 70 (closest) to 100 meters (farthest) from the lidar (the lidar beam path was limited by site constraints and was {approx} 100 meters). When one door of each of the cars was opened (sequentially), the lidar was clearly able to determine which vehicles had been tagged and which one was not. The lidar is probably capable of greater than 0. 5 kilometer standoff distances based on the extreme amount of signal return achieved (so much that the system had to be de-tuned). The BNL lidar system, while optimized to the extent possible with available parts and budget, was not as sensitive as it could be. Steps to improve the lidar are detailed in this report and include using a better laser system (for more stable power output), dual wavelengths (to improve the sensitivity and allow common mode noise reduction and to allow the use of the lidar in a scanning configuration), heterodyning (for range resolved PFT detection) and an off-axis optical configuration (for improved near field sensitivity) ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>folded</b> <b>optics</b> {{reflector}} {{system could}} mitigate {{problems associated with}} the pointability and controllability of the large UHF antenna for MSAT. Such a system is comprised of a parabolic main reflector and a hyperboloidal subreflector (Cassegrain arrangement) or an ellipsoidal subreflector (Gregorian arrangement), either of which brings the feed closer to the main reflector. By shaping the subreflector and the main reflector, an improved scan capability might be achieved {{and the size of the}} required feed aperture-per-beam could be reduced. In such a shaped dual reflector system, the need for overlapping cluster feed arrangement and its concomitant beam forming network could be removed. In this system, a relatively low gain feed element together with the shaped subreflector would be sufficient to produce the required high illumination taper that at the main reflector...|$|E
40|$|We {{have tested}} a {{laparoscope}} that generates three-dimensional images {{in real time}} by the VISIDEPtm technique of al-ternating frames. Images from two separate viewpoints are combined through special <b>folded</b> <b>optics</b> and brought out along a single light path where they are viewed with a single eye or with a single video camera. Liquid-crystal shutters are used to alternately switch between the two stereoscopically related views {{at a rate of}} 10 Hz in accordance with the VJSIDEptm teachings. The resulting three-dimensional image is autostereoscopic and may be viewed on any standard television monitor. Although the instrument provides for two separate viewpoints, it is built to the same external dimensions as conventional monocular laparoscopes with an outside diameter of 11 mm. This laparoscope can be adapted to field-sequential stereo for presentation of separate images to separate eyes with the aide of electro-optic gl asses. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{contract}} entails a configuration study for a phased array fed transmit antenna operating in the frequency band of 17. 7 to 20. 2 GHz. This initial contract provides a basis for understanding the design limitations and advantages of advanced phased array and cluster feeds (both utilizing intergral MMIC modules) illuminating <b>folded</b> reflector <b>optics</b> (both near field and focused types). Design parametric analyses are performed utilizing as constraints the objective secondary performance requirements of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (Table 1. 0). The output of the study provides design information {{which serves as a}} data base for future active phased array fed antenna studies such as detailed designs required to support the development of a ground tested breadboard. In general, this study is significant because it provides the antenna community with an understanding of the basic principles which govern near field phased scanned feed effects on secondary reflector system performance. Although several articles have been written on analysis procedures and results for these systems, the authors of this report have observed phenomenon of near field antenna systems not previously documented. Because the physical justification for the exhibited performance is provided herein, {{the findings of this study}} add a new dimension to the available knowledge of the subject matter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} new {{end effector}} developments incorporating microscope vision and gripping mechanisms for {{pick and place}} assembly of small components in a minifactory environment. Instead of performing microassembly under a microscope, in minifactory each assembly agent is equipped with its own microscope. This arrangement facilitates flow-through manufacturing as opposed to work cell approaches. To this end, we have developed a series of new manipulator end effectors, each of which incorporates a long-range objective lens, coaxial illumination, <b>folded</b> <b>optics,</b> and a camera. Modular gripping and other mechanisms are mounted on a universal plate beneath the end effector. A first type uses vacuum and pressure to pick and place components of a lens assembly.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new design of the Focusing DIRC for the Barrel PID to be used at the {{proposed}} Super-B factory. The new imaging optics is made of a solid Fused Silica block with a double <b>folded</b> <b>optics</b> using two mirrors, one cylindrical and one flat, focusing photons on a detector plane conveniently accessible for the detector access. The design assumes that the BaBar bar boxes are re-used without any modification, including the wedges and windows. Each bar box will have its own focusing block, which will contain 40 H- 9500 (or H- 8500) MaPMTs according to present thinking. There are 12 bar boxes in the entire detector, so the entire SuperB FDIRC system would have 480 MaPMTs. The design is very compact and therefore reduces sensitivity to the background. The chosen MaPMTs are fast {{enough to be able}} both to reject the background and to perform the chromatic correction. The 3 D optics simulation is coded with the Mathematica program.

30|$|The folded z-type {{schlieren system}} is {{especially}} useful for {{looking through the}} windows of a test facility such as a wind tunnel (indicated by a dashed outline in Fig.  1 c, d). Wind tunnels tend to be housed in long narrow rooms, the narrow dimension necessitating the <b>folding</b> of schlieren <b>optics.</b> In extreme cases the parallel schlieren beam can be folded twice, as shown in Fig.  1 d. Such a compact schlieren system serves the transonic wind tunnel of DLR Göttingen, for example, where it is entirely inside the pressure plenum of the facility. Note that the large first-surface folding mirrors FM 1 and FM 2 must be flat to better than ¼ wavelength of light across their surfaces. They may cost as much or more than the parabolic mirrors.|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} is {{developed for the}} design and analysis of single-viewpoint catadioptric cameras that use two or more mirrors. The use of multiple mirrors permits <b>folding</b> of the <b>optics</b> which leads to more compact camera designs than ones that use a single mirror. A dictionary of camera designs that use two conic mirrors is presented. We show that any folded system that uses conic mirrors has a geometrically equivalent system that uses a single conic mirror. This result {{makes it easy to}} determine the scene-toimage mapping of a conic folded system. In addition, we discuss the optical benefits of using folded systems. As an example, we choose a camera design from our dictionary and optimize its parameters via optical simulations. This design is used to construct a compact video camera that provides a hemispherical field of view. ...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of defects (scratches and impacts) {{is vital}} to the certification of flight hardware and other critical components. The amount of damage to a particular component contributes to the performance, reliability, and safety of a system, which ultimately affects {{the success or failure of}} a mission or test. The launch-commit criteria on a Space Shuttle Orbiter window are governed by the depth of the defects that are identified by a visual inspection. This measurement of a defect is not easy to obtain given the environment, size of the defect, and location of the window(s). The determination of depth has typically been performed by taking a mold impression and measuring the impression with an optical profiling instrument. Another method of obtaining an estimate of the depth is by using a refocus microscope. To use a refocus microscope, the surface of the glass and bottom of the defect are, in turn, brought into focus by the operator. The amount of movement between the two points corresponds to the depth of the defect. The refocus microscope requires a skilled operator and has been proven to be unreliable when used on Orbiter windows. White light interferometry was chosen as a candidate to replace the refocus microscope. The White Light Interferometer (WLI) was developed to replace the refocus microscope as the instrument used for measuring the depth of defects in Orbiter windows. The WLI consists of a broadband illumination source, interferometer, detector, motion control, displacement sensor, mechanical housing, and support electronics. The illumination source for the WLI is typically a visible light emitting diode (LED) or a near-infrared superluminescent diode (SLD) with power levels of less than a milliwatt. The interferometer is a Michelson configuration consisting of a 1 -in. (2. 5 -cm) cube beam splitter, a 0. 5 -in. (1. 3 -cm) optical window as a movable leg (used to closely match the return intensity of the fixed leg from the window), and a mirrored prism to <b>fold</b> the <b>optics</b> into the mechanical housing. The detector may be one of many C-mount CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras. Motion is provided by a commercial nanostepping motor with a serial interface. The displacement sensor is a custom device specifically designed for this application. The mechanical housing and support electronics were designed to integrate the various components into an instrument that could be physically handled by a technician and easily transported...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a very compact, real time, passive millimetre wave imager. The most relevant scanning techniques and designs have been explained. Two possible configurations have been studied, simulated and analysed with OSLO and also with Matlab. The design requires an array to provide real time frame rates, whose curvature has been optimized with GRASP, an antenna design program. The system has the following advantages: The imager is compact by using polarisation-rotation techniques to <b>fold</b> the antenna <b>optics.</b> The two rotating components produce a linear scan pattern with a single receiver. The system is capable of real time operation using an array. A novel method of mm-wave illumination has been developed and tested at 35 GHz. Several illumination experiments have been undertaken to increase the temperature of the object compared to its surrounding background and consequently increase the contrast. An opto-mechanical millimetre-wave imager has been used to facilitate these experiments. This prototype, called "Nasa Imager" was a second unit developed at Reading University by Alfa Imaging Ltd. under a NASA grant. This system displays images at a speed rate of 20 seconds/image, with a spatial resolution of 7. 5 mrad. The Nasa imager has also been used to take images of different materials, potential threats or barriers at 35 and 94 GHz. The transmission and reflections properties of some of these materials have been measured at the University ofNavarra. Comparing the results from the mm-wave image analysis with those from the threat characterization, it is observed that there is a high correlation between the two.
