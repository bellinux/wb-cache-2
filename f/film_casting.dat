5|$|Development of {{the film}} began shortly {{after the release of}} Final Destination 2 (2003), though Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the {{franchise}} and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for Final Destination 3. In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a major theme in the <b>film.</b> <b>Casting</b> began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. Final Destination 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's derailment.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 23 reviews, {{and gave}} Angel Heart {{a score of}} 78%, with an average score of 7 out of 10. William Hjortsberg, author of Falling Angel, voiced his support of the film adaptation, stating, [...] " [...] Parker wrote an excellent script {{and went on to}} make a memorable <b>film.</b> <b>Casting</b> Robert De Niro as Cyphre was a brilliant touch." [...] Although initially supportive of Bonet's decision to appear in the film, Bill Cosby dismissed Angel Heart as [...] "a movie made by white America that cast a black girl, gave her voodoo things to do and have sex".|$|E

500|$|The female protagonist [...] "went through {{numerous}} concept sketches, costume designs, hairstyles, names, {{and even}} nationalities." [...] According to Hubbard, {{it was a}} challenge to find a look for her that was not only evocative of era, [...] "but also worked as a 3D model." [...] In the end, the in-game model of Cate Archer was styled after model and actress Mitzi Martin. This was a marketing decision made by the publisher, Fox Interactive, which used its feature <b>film</b> <b>casting</b> department to look for an appropriate model internationally. Archer's voice was provided by American voice actress Kit Harris, who also did the voice of the Inge Wagner character. Originally, Harris recorded the Scottish protagonist's voice in a stronger Scottish accent. This was changed after a Scottish producer of the game felt that the particular accent used was too lower class, and an inappropriate choice; Harris re-recorded her lines with a [...] "British bent" [...] instead.

500|$|Multiple {{critics have}} noted that the {{portrayal}} of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's relationship in the episode features a somewhat of a homosexual subtext. The concept behind it is a parody of stereotypical teen romance <b>film,</b> <b>casting</b> Perry and Doofenshmirtz—two males who are of different species—as the teenage couple who is [...] "breaking up." [...] Perry's initial suspicions over Doofenshmirtz having a new nemesis are portrayed as if a person discovers their significant other is cheating on them. Perry discovers a paw print on Doofenshmirtz's face, resembling a lipstick mark on the cheek {{as if from a}} lover, and Peter the Panda emerges from Doofenshmirtz's closet. Doofenshmirtz initially tries to deny having a new nemesis, but eventually admits to the accusation, noting that he [...] "didn't want [...] to find out this way," [...] overtly detailing a common way couples discover their partner is cheating on them. Perry is depressed about their [...] "break up" [...] and reminisces about their past [...] "relationship" [...] together, while music resembling a love song plays in the background. After feeling depressed himself, Doofenshmirtz [...] "dumps" [...] Peter and reunites with Perry on a talk show prone to featuring romantic confrontations.|$|E
500|$|From a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents {{stressed}} the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay [...] "out of trouble". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a <b>film</b> <b>casting</b> that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was {{the only member of the}} chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E

500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the <b>film,</b> <b>casting</b> its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|E

Madonna contrasted the process of <b>film</b> <b>casting</b> with her task of making a new album, where she can easily choose the people she wants to work with. Abbie Cornish was signed to play the part of Wally Winthrop, while King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson were played by James D'Arcy and Andrea Riseborough, respectively. Winthrop's Russian love interest Evgeni was played by Oscar Isaac and her husband William was played by Richard Coyle. Actress Vera Farmiga was initially asked for the role of Simpson.
