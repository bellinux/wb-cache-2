5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995.

Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ways to <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E

5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to spend {{much of the rest of}} his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E

When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. At times, the young are abandoned by one parent, and they must rely on the return of the other parent, which can recognize the chick only from its unique call.

25|$|Reviews {{note the}} theme of violence. The novel {{examines}} some of the social causes for the violence depicted. The Guardian pointed out the irony {{that the state is}} working to execute Granville Oliver against Washingtonians' consensus when so many other African American men <b>die</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street. and called this an original argument against the death penalty. The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions to the work of Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police.|$|E
