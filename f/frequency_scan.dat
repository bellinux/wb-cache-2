5000|$|Several TV {{stations}} are using or {{have used a}} temporary channel to send their DTV signals, and upon terminating analog, move their digital transmission either back to their old analog channel, or to a third channel (sometimes the former analog of another local station), chosen in the digital channel election in the U.S. This requires all viewers to re-scan or manually add the new channel and possibly delete the old one. Doing a full re-scan will usually cause other channels to be dropped if they cannot be received {{at the moment the}} scan passes their physical channel, so this is typically undesirable, although many ATSC tuners only have this option. Some have an [...] "easy-add" [...] feature which does not delete what is already mapped in memory. Some allow the user to enter the physical channel and an unmapped subchannel, causing the tuner to search the physical channel. Depending on the tuner, this may or may not automatically add the station and its digital subchannels to the map, and/or to the user's [...] "favorites". This may also leave the old [...] "dead" [...] channel mapping in place, so that there is the new 8.1, dead 8.1, new 8.2, dead 8.2, etc. In most cases, TV stations will not have the actual frequency they are currently using on their website. If the auto scan does not pick up the signal and the tuner has manual <b>frequency</b> <b>scan</b> capability try to get the actual frequency from the station engineer.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{discusses}} and {{evaluates the}} ap-proaches {{that can be}} applied to perform frequency scan-ning natured subsynchronous damping analysis by means of electromagnetic transient simulation. In this paper these time domain transient simulation related techniques are referred as dynamic <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> techniques to separate them from the traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> technique applied to subsynchronous resonance screening studies. The two traditional dynamic <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> approaches, modal response and signal injection method, are based on the analysis of the subsynchronous response of the electromechanical system on one single frequency at the time. Although multi-run functionalities has made these methods convenient to use, they cannot be consid-ered effective, or screening study natured, if the damping analysis require for example modeling of highly detailed control systems or sensitivity studies covering high num-ber of operational conditions and parameters. Therefore, spectral injection technique allowing the analysis of sub-synchronous response over the whole subsynchronous frequency range at once is introduced to subsynchrnous damping analysis.
