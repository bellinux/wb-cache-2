Formally, the configuration of OCLBP is denoted as S : (a, b, v, h, p, r): an image is divided into a×b blocks with vertical overlap of v and <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> of h, and then uniform patterns LBP(u2,p,r) are extracted from all the blocks. Moreover, OCLBP is composed of several different configurations. For example, in their original paper, the authors used three configurations: S : (10,10,12,12,8,1),(14,14,12,12,8,2),(18,18,12,12,8,3). The three configurations consider three block sizes: 10×10, 14×14, 18×18, and half overlap rates along the vertical and horizontal directions. These configurations are concatenated to form a 40877 dimensional feature vector for an image of size 150x80.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} scope of the Pinch Analysis for process {{modifications}} of individual processes to total site heat integration (TSHI). The Plus-Minus principle has been adapted to enable the beneficial process modification options to be selected in order to maximise energy savings in TSHI. The Total Site Profile (TSP) is divided into three regions: (a) the region above the <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> between the Site Sink and Source Profiles, (b) the <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> region and (c) below the <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> region. The proposed methodology identifies the options to reduce utility targets in these regions using the TSP, Site Utility Composite Curves (SCC), Utility Grand Composite Curve (UGCC), modified Problem Table Algorithm (PTA), Total Site Problem Table Algorithm (TS-PTA) and some new heuristics. The identified changes on the TSP are then linked to the specific changes at the individual processes. The illustrative case study shows that the Plus-Minus principle application in the TSHI context can further improve heat recovery. The proposed spreadsheet-based methodology combines the advantages of graphical visualisation, as well as the numerical precision...|$|E

Segmentation of Nom {{characters}} from body text regions of stele images is a challenging problem {{due to the}} confusing spatial distribution of the connected components composing these characters. In this paper, for each vertical text line, area Voronoi diagram is employed to represent the neighborhood of the connected components and Voronoi edges are used as nonlinear segmentation hypotheses. Characters are then segmented by selecting appropriate adjacent Voronoi regions. For this purpose, we utilize {{the information about the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> of connected components and the recognition distances of candidate characters provided by an OCR engine. Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly accurate and robust to various types of stele.

40|$|The Norwegian Sea {{harbours}} {{several large}} pelagic fish stocks, which use {{the area for}} feeding during the summer. The period 1995 – 2006 {{had some of the}} highest biomass of pelagic fish feeding in the Norwegian Sea on record. Here we address the horizontal distribution and overlap between herring, blue whiting and mackerel in this period during the summers using a combination of acoustic, trawl and LIDAR data. A newly developed temperature atlas for the Norwegian Sea is used to present the horizontal fish distributions in relation to temperature. The centre of gravity of the herring distribution changed markedly several times during the investigated period. Blue whiting feeding habitat expanded in a northwestern direction until 2003, corresponding with an increase in abundance. Strong year classes of mackerel in 2001 and 2002 and increasing temperatures throughout the period resulted in an increased amount of mackerel in the Norwegian Sea. Mackerel was generally found in waters warmer than 8 °C, while herring and blue whiting were mainly found in water masses between 2 and 8 °C. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> between herring and mackerel was low, while blue whiting had a large <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> with both herring and mackerel. The changes in horizontal distribution and overlap between the species are explained by increasing stock sizes, increasing water temperature and spatially changing zooplankton densities in the Norwegian Sea...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{estimate}} {{the contribution of}} various occlusal features of the natural dentition that may identify self-reported bruxers compared to nonbruxers. METHODS: Two age- and sex-matched groups of self-reported bruxers (n = 67) and self-reported nonbruxers (n = 75) {{took part in the}} study. For each patient, the following occlusal features were clinically assessed: retruded contact position (RCP) to intercuspal contact position (ICP) slide length (4 mm, a deep bite), <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> (> 4 mm was considered a large <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap),</b> incisor dental midline discrepancy (< 2 mm was considered normal), and the presence of a unilateral posterior crossbite, mediotrusive interferences, and laterotrusive interferences. A multiple logistic regression model was used to identify the significant associations between the assessed occlusal features (independent variables) and self-reported bruxism (dependent variable). RESULTS: Accuracy values to predict self-reported bruxism were unacceptable for all occlusal variables. The only variable remaining in the final regression model was laterotrusive interferences (P =. 030). The percentage of explained variance for bruxism by the final multiple regression model was 4. 6 %. This model including only one occlusal factor showed low positive (58. 1 %) and negative predictive values (59. 7 %), thus showing a poor accuracy to predict the presence of self-reported bruxism (59. 2 %). CONCLUSION: This investigation suggested that the contribution of occlusion to the differentiation between bruxers and nonbruxers is negligible. This finding supports theories that advocate a much diminished role for peripheral anatomical-structural factors in the pathogenesis of bruxism...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore a}} new {{technique}} for reconstructing and measuring three-dimensional (3 D) models of orthodontic plaster casts using multi-baseline digital close-range photogrammetry (MBDCRP) with a single-lens reflex camera. Thirty sets of orthodontic plaster casts that do not exhibit severe <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> (> 2 mm) between any two teeth were recorded by a single-lens reflex camera with 72 pictures taken in different directions. The 3 D models of these casts were reconstructed and measured using the open source software MeshLab. These parameters, including mesio-distal crown diameter, arch width, and arch perimeter, were recorded six times on both the 3 D digital models and on plaster casts by two examiners. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Bland-Altman method to measure agreement between the novel method and the traditional calliper method by calculating the differences between mean values. The average differences between the measurements of the photogrammetric 3 D models and the plaster casts were 0. 011 - 0. 402 mm. The mean differences between measurements obtained by the photogrammetric 3 D models and the dental casts were not significant except for the lower arch perimeter (P> 0. 05), and all the differences were regarded as clinically acceptable (< 0. 5 mm). Measurements obtained by MBDCRP are compared well with those obtained from plaster casts, indicating that MBDCRP is an alternate way to store and measure dental plaster casts without severe <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> between any two teeth...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{study the}} {{distribution}} of various occlusal schemes as well as associated static occlusal relationship among Thais. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The subjects’occlusal schemes {{on the left and}} right sides were classified as canine protected occlusion, group function, or unclassified according to the definition from Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms (8 th edition). In addition, the presence of occlusal interferences during mandibular excursions were recorded. The measurement of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> and vertical overlap was also performed. Chi-square, One-way ANAVA and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests were used with level of significance set at P=. 05. RESULTS. Total of 104 subjects were included in this study. The ratio for male to female was 1. 8 to 1. Average age of the population was 25. 01 ± 6. 87 years old. The mean vertical overlap and <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap</b> were 1. 94 ± 1. 20 and 2. 41 ± 1. 32 mm respectively. The majority of the populations (68. 3 %) possessed group function occlusal scheme. For the remaining, 17. 3 % possess canine protected occlusion and 12. 5 % possess combination of both occlusal schemes. We also found that occlusal interference was presented in 20. 2 % of the population. The most common was protrusive interference (57. 14 %), the second was balancing interference (38. 1 %) and the third was working interference (4. 1 %). CONCLUSION. Among Thais, the most common occlusal scheme was group function, however there were no significant occlusal factors related to any particular occlusal scheme.

40|$|Abstract: This article proposes an {{empirical}} method for finding {{the determinants of}} the size of remedy offers relative to the level required by the European Commission in individual cases. Evidence is presented that merger characteristics, such as the size of the transaction, or the number of <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlaps</b> do not affect the probability of a remedy offer being successful. It is also shown that pre-merger expectations about merger-generated efficiencies increase the likelihood of successful offers. These findings are very important features of EC merger control, and a novelty in the existing literature. If parties are delay-averse, then the complexity of the case matters very little, as merging parties appear to be able to offer something outright acceptable for the Commission. This may lead to a counter-productive situation where less delay-averse mergers become more prone to offering too much, which can result in over-fixing the competition problem for those mergers where savings would be more likely...|$|R

40|$|Most mergers filed at the {{enforcement}} agencies are conglomerate in nature with only minor <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlaps.</b> An enforcement agency may challenge the merger, if any overlap {{is believed to}} be adversely affected by the transaction. While the merging firm is entitled to a hearing in federal court, the delay would impose additional costs, thereby giving {{the enforcement}} agency the ability to hold up the bulk of the transaction, pending resolution. Hence, the agency’s actions are not fully checked by the threat of litigation. This paper explores whether the FTC’s decisions to challenge conglomerate transactions that could feasibly settle differ from the controlling case law. We find that the representative enforcement regimes are remarkably similar, though the FTC is more accepting of efficiencies arguments, while the court considers buyer sophistication as a mitigating factor.

The cluster sample consisted of 717 teenagers attending 24 urban public (n= 611) and 5 rural public (n= 107) schools in Maringá/PR. Malocclusion was measured using the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI), in accordance with WHO recommendations. A parental questionnaire was applied to collect information on esthetic perception level and oral variables related to oral health.

Multiple logistic regression confirmed that for 12 -year-old, missing teeth (OR= 2. 865) and presence of openbite (open occlusal relationship) (OR= 2. 865) were risk indicators for speech capability. With regard to 15 -year-old, presence of mandibular overjet (<b>horizontal</b> <b>overlap)</b> (OR= 4. 016) was a risk indicator for speech capability and molar relationship (OR= 1. 661) was a risk indicator for chewing capability.

Thirty six consecutive patients with 50 impacted maxillary canines were examined and variables were measured for each impacted tooth using Dolphin 3 D software. Ten orthodontists assessed the radiographs of teeth and provided their opinion on the difficulty in bringing impacted teeth into occlusion named subjective degree of difficulty (SDD). The correlation established between mean SDD of each tooth and measured variables were analyzed by means of linear regression. RESULTS: Mean SDD was 6. 45 &# 177; 1. 22 for all 50 teeth.

40|$|A main {{parameter}} for {{the collision}} risk is the Passing Frequency. The collision risk model, originally developed by P. R.

For estimating the collision risk due to loss of vertical separation a method is proposed which estimates directly the probability of occurances of <b>horizontal</b> <b>overlaps.</b> This method has the following advantages: 1. The estimated overlap frequencies are nearly independent {{of the behavior of}} aircraft concerning navigation on air routes. 2. The proposed method is suited for a system which determines automatically the overlap frequencies similar to a short term conflict probe. Using the proposed method overlap frequencies for northern and southern Germany were determined. For doing this radar data were available for one week separately for both parts of Germany. A main result of the study is that 88 % of the observed passing events are crossing events. But one has to consider the definition for crossings which was utilized. A great part of crossings occured on air routes possibly {{due to the fact that}} aircraft were not advised to fly accurately on centerlines. Concerning the collision risk the results are given in table 3. Only with MASPS certified aircraft the collision risk is well below the TLS in a future 1000 ft vertical seperation environment. This is also true for high density areas like the airspace around Frankfurt. The results of the study permit no clear answer about the necessity of using offsets when flying on air routes. It depends on navigation systems and procedures which will be used in the future. (orig.)
