5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all <b>fragments</b> of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several <b>fragments</b> after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably <b>fragments</b> of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary <b>fragments</b> in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest <b>fragments</b> being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller <b>fragments</b> were probably destroyed before they even reached the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Demeter, Philitas' {{most famous}} work, {{consisted}} of elegiac couplets, or couplets in the elegiac meter.

The <b>fragments</b> describe Demeter's arrival on Cos and warm welcome by its royal family of Meropids, or humans twice normal size, thus presenting the founding myth of a local cult of Demeter on Cos.|$|E
