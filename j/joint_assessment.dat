40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to address {{the gap in the}} area of wearable knee <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment.</b> Knee injuries are among the most common reasons for doctor’s visits. The physical examinations of the joint during these visits are typically limited to qualitative observations. Examination methods based on diagnostic imaging are expensive and time consuming. Beyond the clinic, such as in the home or with wearable technologies, there are no viable solutions available for providing in-depth, quantitative <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment.</b> Developing novel, ubiquitous technologies for <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment</b> would enable personalized, feedback-controlled therapies for patients. Towards the proposed research goal, sensing systems and signal processing techniques that can provide biomarkers for knee <b>joint</b> health <b>assessment</b> are developed and discussed. Two types of physiological signals acquired from the knee joint are considered for this purpose: (1) electrical bioimpedance and (2) acoustic emission signals. Ph. D...|$|R

25|$|Outcalt's {{proposal}} was criticized by architect Little, who argued {{it was cut}} {{off from the rest of}} downtown, mixed parking and exhibit space in the same building, used open space rather than demolishing old and decrepit buildings, was too hemmed in by its proposed hotel and office towers, did not provide for the expansion of City Hall or the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, failed to give the city a visual symbol of its progress (by being buried beneath the mall), and was both too big to be built swiftly and too little to provide the economic stimulus the city wanted. Despite his criticisms, a week later the Cleveland investment banking firm of Ball, Burge & Kraus said it would issue bonds or stock or a combination in order to finance construction of the hotel and office building. Both Outcalt and Little called for additional studies, and the Cleveland City Planning Commission hired consultants John T. Howard and Walter H.

25|$|Members {{of these}} various {{workshops}} and study tours {{have been responsible}} for the identification of effective strategies that have increasingly {{been at the forefront of}} HIV control policy in China. They have also contributed to the development of strategic documents, including the Medium- and Long-Term Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS (1998–2010), the Action Plan on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Containment (2001–2005), and the AIDS Regulations. Other key documents warned of the potential epidemic in China and might have influenced the attitudes of policymakers. China's Titanic Peril, published by the UN in 2002, made the unsubstantiated prediction that China could have 10 million HIV-infected individuals by 2010, a figure that has been repeatedly misused in discussions of China's HIV future. A <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (2004), developed jointly by UNAIDS and the State Council of China, estimated that China had 840,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. This figure has been revised down to 650,000 in 2005 in light of more representative data collection and more appropriate estimation methods. Although this figure represented a prevalence of about 0.05%, it was substantially higher than previous government estimates (300,000 in 1998) and provided the impetus for immediate scale-up of prevention and control strategies.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} apply {{knowledge}} of basic {{science and engineering}} fundamentals associated with each and every subject learnt in their undergraduate program is an essential attribute of the chemical engineering graduate. Even though principles of chemical engineering are distributed across the units from first to fourth year, a chemical engineer {{should be able to}} relate all these principles to solve chemical engineering problems. However, relating these principles and drawing parallels between these subjects is not an easy task unless during their undergraduate study, a chemical engineering student was given training in doing projects involving principles across a variety of units. In view of the above necessity, chemical engineering at Curtin University has implemented combined projects and <b>joint</b> <b>assessments</b> between two units which not only provides an avenue for students to experience relating concepts they learnt from different units, but also reduces the work load for both teaching staff and students. In this paper, two experiences of having combined projects and <b>joint</b> <b>assessments</b> between units in chemical engineering program are presented and discussed...|$|R
