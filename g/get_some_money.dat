My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>money</b> somewhere. I'm sure {{not going to get}} it from the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity to become the first chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E
500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>money</b> out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E

2500|$|... "The Subway Vigilante," [...] as Goetz {{was labeled}} by New York City media, was front-page news for months, partly {{owing to the}} {{repressed}} passions the incident unleashed in New York and other cities. Public opinion tended to {{fall into one of}} three camps: Those in the first camp tended to believe Goetz's version of the incident, that he was aggressively accosted and surrounded by the four men and feared he was about to be beaten and robbed. Those in the second camp tended to believe the version told by the four men, that they were merely panhandling to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>money</b> to play video games. A third camp believed that Goetz had indeed been threatened, but viewed the shooting as an unjustified overreaction.|$|E

At about 9:15p.m., Wayne had just finished a song and was still on stage to introduce her fellow performers when she was shot in the chest by a bullet fired from a [...]22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne died almost instantly as the bullet severed her aorta. In Entertaining Vietnam, a 2003 documentary directed and produced by Mara Wallis, Taylor was interviewed on the events of Wayne's death, footage of a Sweethearts on Parade performance with Wayne singing was shown (see screenshot at left). Taylor recalled that he was sitting about a metre (three feet) behind Wayne and that Cavanagh had stepped forward to cradle his fiancée when she slumped to the floor.|$|E

(Young William O. Goodridge testified this was the case, at the time; Wallace had already moved to Michigan that summer and was not available to testify at Glenalvin's trial.

Between 1865 and 1890, when Rhoda remarried, Wallace supported Glenalvin's widow and her remaining children in his own home.|$|R

2500|$|A prologue of VA-11 HALL-A was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Cyberpunk Game Jam of 2014; however, Sukeban liked the game {{so much that they}} eventually turned it into a full game. Ortiz noted that this was as the developers wanted to see more characters and expand on the stories of the world they built, as well as them looking for a [...] "good challenge design-wise" [...] that engages the player. The developers later retrospectively noted that the prologue also helped to [...] "gauge interest, <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>money</b> to fund development, and [...] a bonus for pre-ordering all at the same time." [...] This original game jam prototype of VA-11 HALL-A is available to download for free on the game's official website. Additionally, a [...] "redux" [...] version of the prologue was also later redeveloped, serving as a free downloadable content update for the full game; it was released in February 2017. A demo of the game was playable at PAX Prime 2015, as well as at PAX East 2015, when a trailer was also shown. In the demo, the player interacts with [...] "Streaming-chan", a woman who constantly streams her life on the internet.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Lords became {{pregnant}} by her high school boyfriend. Afraid of her mother's reaction, she went to Hayes for help. He arranged {{for her to have}} an abortion without her mother's knowledge. Looking for a job to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>money,</b> she was introduced to his friend and started working for her as a babysitter. The woman offered to improve Lords' job opportunities by helping her get a fake driver's license. She provided Lords with a new birth certificate on condition that if she were ever caught she would say that she had stolen the phony identification. Lords now had a new driver's license with the name Kristie Elizabeth Nussman that stated she was 22 rather than 15 years old. She was now able to line up a few job interviews. In February 1984, Lords answered a newspaper advertisement for Jim South's World Modeling Talent Agency. Posing as her stepfather, Hayes drove her to the agency. After signing a contract, she began working as a nude model and appeared in magazines such as Velvet, Juggs, and Club. During August, when she was selected to model for Penthouse magazine's 15th-anniversary issue, Lords was asked to choose a stage name. She chose Traci—one of the popular names she had longed for growing up—and Lords, after the actor Jack Lord, since she was a fan of the television series Hawaii Five-O, in which he portrayed the character of Steve McGarrett. Some of her schoolmates recognized her in the Velvet magazine pictorial. [...] Lords subsequently quit high school at age 15 and entered the sex industry, where formal education was irrelevant. The September 1984 issue, which featured Lords in a nude centerfold – she earned $5,000 for the shoot – became the best-selling issue in the history of Penthouse, partly because it also featured a nude pictorial of Vanessa Williams (appearing with George Burns on the cover photograph), who had won the Miss America Pageant the previous year. [...] Lords' article stated that she was 22 years of age, was a virgin until nineteen, and had studied interior design at El Camino College.|$|E
