The combined effect of mechanical forces and {{one or more of}} these agents may be <b>inhibitory,</b> <b>additive</b> or synergistic. The aim of this review was to outline the mechanisms of action and effects of some commonly used drugs on tissue remodeling and Orthodontic Tooth Movement (OTM). A review on the effects of medications and dietary supplements on the rate of experimental tooth movement was performed using Cochrane library, Embase and Medline (1980 - 2013). 63 articles were included in the review. 34 of them related to the effects of hormones and analgesics were evaluated in the first part of this review. The rest of them (29 articles) were evaluated in the current review, but their interpretation was hindered by the variability in experimental design, magnitude of force applied during tooth movement and medication regimens. Vitamin D 3 might enhance the pace of tooth movement, but dietary calcium and fluorides appear to reduce the rate of OTM. Bisphosphonates (BPNs) are considered to have marked inhibitory effects on the rate of tooth movement. Nicotine and nitric oxide might effectively increase the speed of OTM. All drugs reviewed had therapeutic effects, as well as side effects, that may influence the cells targeted by orthodontic forces. Therefore, it is imperative that the orthodontist pays close attention to the drug consumption history of each and every patient, before and during the course of orthodontic treatment. When the use of drugs is revealed, their effects and side effects on tissue systems should be explored to determine their potential influence on the outcome of mechanotherapy...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop simple, rapid and {{reliable}} methods for the selective determination of Bifidus essensis from ACTIVIA (Danone) yogurts. The methods are based on a modified MRS medium (B-broth), which does not contain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>additives.</b> The sugar source of the medium is maltose, which is metabolized by the bifidobacteria applied in the probiotic products, and not by the normal microflora of yogurt (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). The redox potential of the medium was reduced with cysteine-HCl. Due to its reduced redox potential, the new bouillon is suitable for aerobic cultivation of bifidobacteria, while in agar form it needs anaerobic incubation. In bouillon form (MPN method) the incubation time is only 2 days compared to the 5 -day requirement of the classical anaerobic plate counting methods. The B-broth in diluted form was successfully used in a RABIT (Don Whitley) equipment for selective impedimetric determination of bifidobacteria in Danone yogurts. The exact detection time of the Bifidobacterium counts in a good quality probiotic yogurt, containing bifidobacteria at a concentration of 107 to 10 8 CFU ml− 1 is not more than 10 to 12 h (in contrast to the 5 days of classical anaerobic plate counting methods). ...|$|R

In {{previous}} studies performed by our group, we observed that 2 -deoxyglucose blocked the acidification {{of the medium}} used for culture of colon cancer cells caused by incubation with biguanides and it had an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on growth. In the present work, we found that 3 -bromopyruvate can also prevent the lowering of pH caused by biguanide treatment. 3 -Bromopyruvate inhibited colonic cancer cell proliferation, but the effect was not always additive to that of biguanides and an additive effect was more notable in combined treatment with 3 -bromopyruvate and 2 -deoxyglucose. The induction of alkaline phosphatase activity by butyrate was not consistently affected by combination with other agents that modified glucose metabolism. The drug combinations that were examined inhibited proliferation of wild-type and p 53 -null cells and affected colonic cancer lines with different growth rates. In earlier work, our group has found that incubation of colonic cancer cells with 2 -deoxyglucose had an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on proliferation when used with the biguanides metformin and phenformin, and blocked the acidification caused by these biguanides (1). A number of mechanisms have been suggested for the antitumor effects of 3 -bromopyruvate (2 - 5). Prominent among these are inhibitory effects on glycolysis, particularly those exerted at the levels of hexokinase and glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Following our work with 2 -deoxyglucose, we have sought to examine the following questions. Firstly, does 3 -bromopyruvate block the acidification of the medium caused by incubation of colonic cancer cells with metformin or phenformin and does such an effect correlate closely with a decrease in glucose metabolism? Secondly, are there <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects on proliferation when treatment with 3 -bromopyruvate is combined with metformin or phenformin? Thirdly, is the differentiating effect of butyrate on colonic cancer cells influenced by 3 -bromopyruvate? Fourthly, do p 53 null HCT 116 colonic cancer cells differ from wild-type cells in their response to 3 -bromopyruvate as judged by rates of glucose metabolism and proliferation?

As for other mammalian ORs, few dog OR have been deorphanized, {{mainly because of the}} absence of good methodology and the difficulties encountered to express ORs at the cell surface. Within this work, our aim was 1) to deorphanize a large subset of dog OR and 2) to compare the implication of the 2 main pathways, namely the cAMP and inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (IP 3) pathways, in the transduction of the olfactory message. For this, we used 2 independent tests to assess the importance of each of these 2 pathways and analyzed the responses of 47 canine family 6 ORs to a number of aliphatic compounds. We found these ORs globally capable of inducing intracellular calcium elevation through the IP 3 pathway as confirmed by the use of specific inhibitors and/or a cAMP increase in response to aldehyde exposure. We showed that the implication of the cAMP or/and IP 3 pathway was dependent upon the ligand–receptor combination rather than on one or the other partner. Finally, by exposing OR-expressing cells to the 21 possible pairs of C 6 –C 12 aliphatic aldehydes, we confirmed that some odorant pairs may have an <b>inhibitory</b> or <b>additive</b> effect.

Transmitter release saturated at external Ca 2 + concentrations higher than 4 mM, the releasing mechanism probably being the limiting step. Antagonists of Ca 2 + entry (Mg 2 +, Cd 2 +, diltiazem) decreased the sensitivity of acetylcholine release to Ca 2 +, acting as competitive inhibitors, and reduced the stimulation-induced 45 Ca accumulation. Quinacrine produced similar effects, indicating that it interacts primarily with Ca 2 + entry. In contrast, oxotremorine and adenosine depressed transmitter release proportionally at all Ca 2 + concentrations, acting as non-competitive inhibitors, and did not modify the stimulation-induced 45 Ca accumulation.

In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of CdTe quantum dots (CdTe-QDs), a common form of NP, and UV-B radiation on wheat seedlings. Graded doses of CdTe-QDs and UV-B radiation were tested, either alone or in combination, based on physical characteristics of 5 -day-old seedlings. Treatments of wheat seedlings with either CdTe-QDs (200 mg/L) or UV-B radiation (10 KJ/m 2 /d) induced the activation of wheat antioxidant enzymes.

Currently, with further investigation into drugs, a number of new pharmacological effects have been found that offer new methods for clinical application in the treatment of breast cancer. As a widely used antidiabetic drug, rosiglitazone (Ros) has become well known for its anticancer effects, mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and downregulated expres-sion of the associated invasion gene. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the combination of Ros and docetaxel (DOC) and whether DOC has any effect on breast cancer cell lines. The results showed that the combination of Ros and DOC may cooperate to increase anti‑growth efficacy. The <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects on cell proliferation were sequence-dependent and are not likely to be associated with cell cycle arrest. This suggested that the target activation of associated factors of the signaling pathway by Ros may be a compelling ally in cancer treatment. In addition, evidence was provided for a convergence of Ros and DOC to induce the reduced expression of CD 44 v 6.

Calpain activation and subsequent apoptosis were inhibited by calpeptin and PD 150606, two calpain inhibitors with different modes of action. Furthermore, cisplatin induced cleavage of the BH 3 -only protein Bid, yielding a 14 -kDa fragment similar to proapoptotic, caspase-cleaved Bid. However, Bid cleavage was inhibited by inhibitors of calpain, {{but not by}} inhibitors of caspases or of cathepsin L. Recombinant Bid was cleaved in vitro by both recombinant calpain and by lysates of cisplatin-treated cells. Cleavage was calpeptin sensitive, and the cleavage site was mapped between Gly 70 and Arg 71. Calpain-cleaved Bid induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. While calpeptin did not affect cisplatin-induced modulation of Bak to its proapoptotic conformation, a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK 1 (dnMEKK) inhibited Bak modulation. dnMEKK did not, however, block Bid cleavage. The combination of dnMEKK and calpeptin had an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on apoptosis. In summary, calpain-mediated Bid cleavage is important in drug-induced apoptosis, and cisplatin induces at least two separate apoptotic signaling pathways resulting in Bid cleavage and Bak modulation, respectively...|$|R

Yet, rubber mastication which is the current practice of achieving this is expensive, requiring high energy and equipment cost. To address this problem, microbial degradation of natural rubber (NR) and waste rubber tire (WRT) by Nocardia sp. strain 385 A was studied using dilute solution viscosity measurement and weight loss methods. Solutions of NR and WRT in toluene were inoculated with the microbes (Nocardia sp. strain 385 A) and kept in incubator. Incubation period varied between 0 to 10 weeks. The results obtained show that NR and WRT were mineralized and degraded by the microbes. Intrinsic viscosity values of both NR and WRT decreased with increasing period of incubation, indicating that degradation increases with increase in the incubation period. For the incubation periods investigated, WRT produced higher intrinsic viscosity values than NR due to the <b>inhibitory</b> effect of <b>additives</b> present in WRT to microbial degradation. Equivalent reduction in molecular weight obtained by rubber mastication technique was achieved by microbial degradation after 10 weeks incubation period.

It has been proposed that targeting cancer cell metabolism would provide a new selective anticancer therapeutic strategy. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of b-oxidation and de novo fatty acid synthesis would reduce cell proliferation in human myeloma cells. We evaluated the effect of etomoxir and orlistat on fatty acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, cell cycle distribution, proliferation, cell death and expression of G 1 /S phase regulatory proteins in myeloma cells. Etomoxir and orlistat inhibited b-oxidation and de novo fatty acid synthesis respectively in myeloma cells, without altering significantly glucose metabolism. These effects were associated with reduced cell viability and cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1. Specifically, etomoxir and orlistat reduced by 40 – 70 % myeloma cells proliferation. The combination of etomoxir and orlistat resulted in an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on cell proliferation. Orlistat induced apoptosis and sensitized RPMI- 8226 cells to apoptosis induction by bortezomib, whereas apoptosis was not altered by etomoxir. Finally, the inhibitory effect of both drugs on cell proliferation was associated with reduced p 21 protein levels and phosphorylation levels of retinoblastoma protein.

40|$|Introduction: Glycolysis shows a {{positive}} correlation with growth of human colon cancer cells. PFKFB 3 is an important enzyme regulating glycolysis in many tumor cells and presents a target for cancer chemotherapy. We studied the action of an inhibitor of PFKFB 3, 3 -(3 -pyridinyl) - 1 -(4 -pyridinyl) - 2 -propen- 1 -one (3 PO), as a single agent and {{in combination with other}} molecules that affect glycolysis. Materials and methods: Effects on growth were studied in four human colon cancer cell lines. Glucose metabolism was monitored by uptake from the incubation medium and lactic acid production was judged by acidification of the medium. Induction of alkaline phosphatase served as a marker of differentiation. Results: Growth of colon cancer cells was inhibited by 3 PO and butyrate but only butyrate induced activation of alkaline phosphatase. Although metformin and phenformin can increase glucose metabolism, they inhibit colon cancer cell growth and can exert <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects in combination with 3 PO. <b>Additive</b> growth <b>inhibitory</b> effects with 3 PO were also observed with two compounds that inhibit glycolysis: 2 -deoxyglucose and 3 -bromopyruvate. Conclusion: 3 PO was an inhibitor of growth of colon cancer cells and may be a useful agent in combination with other drugs that inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} {{malignant}} cells {{have a higher}} nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) turnover rate than normal cells, {{as well as the}} ability to escape immune responses. Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is reported to be a negative immune regulator. Overexpression of IDO in dendritic cells is observed in tumor-draining lymph nodes. IDO-expressing dendritic cells suppress T-cell activation and promote immune tolerance. The nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) inhibitor APO 866 (also called FK 866 or WK 175) selectively inhibits tumor growth through intracellular NAD depletion. The IDO-specific inhibitor L- 1 -methyl-tryptophan (L- 1 MT) activates immune responses and reduces tumor volume in murine tumor models. We combined L- 1 MT and APO 866 treatments and tested their antitumor effects in the murine gastric and bladder tumor models. In immune-competent mice, a combination of APO 866 and L- 1 MT had a better therapeutic effect than did either L- 1 MT or APO 866 alone. The intracellular level of NAD was suppressed by APO 866 but not L- 1 MT. However, an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on tumor growth was not observed in tumor-bearing immune-deficient mice. The new strategy of combining a metabolic inhibitor and an immune adjuvant induced a potent therapeutic effect...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of pseudolaric acid B on subcutaneous xenografts of human gastric adenocarcinoma {{and the underlying}} molecular mechanisms involved in its multidrug resistance. Methods: Human gastric adenocarcinoma SGC 7901 cells and drug-resistant SGC 7901 /ADR cells were injected into nude mice to establish a subcutaneous xenograft model. The effects of pseudolaric acid B with or without adriamycin treatment were compared by determining the tumor size and weight. Cyclo-oxygenase- 2, protein kinaseC-a and P-glycoprotein expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Results: Pseudolaric acid B significantly suppressed the tumor growth induced by SGC 7901 cells and SGC 7901 /ADR cells. The combination of pseudolaric acid B and the traditional chemotherapy drug adriamycin exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on the growth of gastric cancer in vivo than treatment with either pseudolaric acid B or adriamycin alone. Protein expression levels of cyclo-oxygenase- 2, protein kinaseC-a and P-glycoprotein were inhibited by pseudolaric acid B alone or in combination with adriamycin in SGC 7901 /ADR cell xenografts. Conclusion: Pseudolaric acid B has a significant inhibitory effect and an <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect in combination with adriamycin on the growth of gastric cancer in vivo, which reverses the multidrug resistance of gastric neoplasm to chemotherapy drugs by downregulating the Cox- 2 /PKC-a/P-gp/mdr 1 signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShock {{and kill}} {{strategies}} involving {{the use of}} small molecules to induce viral transcription in resting CD 4 + T cells (shock) followed by immune mediated clearance of the reactivated cells (kill), have been proposed {{as a method of}} eliminating latently infected CD 4 + T cells. The combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin and protein kinase C (PKC) agonist bryostatin- 1 is very effective at reversing latency in vitro. However, we found that primary HIV- 1 specific CD 8 + T cells were not able to eliminate autologous resting CD 4 + T cells that had been reactivated with these drugs. We tested the hypothesis that the drugs affected primary CD 8 + T cell function and found that both agents had inhibitory effects on the suppressive capacity of HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells from patients who control viral replication without antiretroviral therapy (elite suppressors/controllers). The <b>inhibitory</b> effect was <b>additive</b> and multi-factorial in nature. These inhibitory effects were not seen with prostratin, another PKC agonist, either alone or in combination with JQ 1, a bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor. Our results suggest that because of their adverse effects on primary CD 8 + T cells, some LRAs may cause immune-suppression and therefore should be used with caution in shock and kill strategies...|$|R
40|$|Although {{nitric oxide}} (NO) has potent {{antiplatelet}} actions, the signaling pathways affected by NO in the platelet are poorly understood. Since NO can induce platelet disaggregation and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) activation renders aggregation irreversible, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that NO exerts its antiplatelet effects {{at least in part}} by inhibiting PI 3 -kinase. The results demonstrate that the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (S-NO-glutathione) inhibits the stimulation of PI 3 -kinase associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and of p 85 /PI 3 -kinase associated with the SRC family kinase member LYN following the exposure of platelets to thrombin receptor-activating peptide. The activation of LYN-associated PI 3 -kinase was unrelated to changes in the amount of PI 3 -kinase physically associated with LYN signaling complexes but did require the activation of LYN and other tyrosine kinases. The cyclic GMP-dependent kinase activator 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP had similar effects on PI 3 -kinase activity, consistent with a model in which the cyclic nucleotide mediates the effects of NO. Additional studies showed that wortmannin and S-NO-glutathione have <b>additive</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects on thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation and the surface expression of platelet activation markers. These data provide evidence of a distinct and novel mechanism for the inhibitory effects of NO on platelet function...|$|R
