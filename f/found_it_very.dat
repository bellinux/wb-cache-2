5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Born in Kirkheaton, Hirst first {{achieved}} {{success for}} Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting {{developed at the}} expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball swing in the air after he released it. He {{was one of the first}} bowlers to control the swing of the ball; batsmen <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to counter this method and Hirst's bowling was subsequently far more successful. From 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against Leicestershire—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire and he may have suffered from playing in Australia where playing conditions did not suit him.|$|E
5|$|The 1930 season saw the Australians tour England, Bradman's first tour. Over five Tests, {{the young}} Australian scored 974 {{runs in a}} {{flawless}} batting display to break Hammond's record run aggregate and average set in the 1928–29 series. While Bradman dominated, Hammond <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to play the leg spin bowling of Clarrie Grimmett, who dismissed him five times. Hammond scored 306 runs {{at an average of}} 34.00, passing fifty just twice. He batted over five hours for a match-saving 113 in the third Test. On a difficult pitch and with little support, he made a hard-hitting 60 in the final Test in a losing cause. The visitors took the series 2–1, and the newspapers unfavourably compared Hammond's scoring with Bradman's. Later in the season, Hammond scored 89 for Gloucestershire in a tied match against the Australians which he described as the most exciting of his career. One player said that he had never seen Hammond as excited as he was {{at the conclusion of the}} game. In all first-class cricket that season, he scored 2,032 runs (average 53.47) and for Gloucestershire, he came top of the batting averages as the club finished second in the Championship. He took 30 wickets, including match figures of 12 for 74 against Glamorgan.|$|E

25|$|After the battle, Albert of Bavaria {{remained}} at Kuinre {{for a few}} more days, but, as Juw Juwinga had predicted, he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to operate in the marshy terrain with an army of knights. Furthermore, it started to rain all day, while the sea got more and more tempestuous. On 6 September he gave up and went home, after a campaign of only ten days and with no gains other than revenge for the defeat of 1345 to show for it.|$|E
25|$|The weather caused severe {{difficulties}} for both sides. Mild autumn weather had lasted longer than usual. Normally, frosts made the inadequate roads passable after the muddy conditions of autumn but on 17 December {{there was a}} thaw, followed by a two-day thaw beginning on 26 December. The result was that both sides <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to manoeuvre. In particular the French (as they were advancing) had great difficulty bringing up their artillery, and so had none available at Golymin.|$|E

25|$|PTSD became first evident due {{to those}} {{individuals}} who suffered extremely horrible experiences from war. Society noticed that those {{who took part in}} war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that these people had post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|Before 1946 a new World Champion had won {{the title}} by {{defeating}} the former champion in a match. Alexander Alekhine's death created an interregnum that made the normal procedure impossible. The situation was very confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions. FIDE <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the interregnum because problems with money and travel so soon {{after the end of}} World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confused.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 1739, {{the town}} of Stockbridge was incorporated, and the Rev. Arthur Lawrence, a Stockbridge historian, <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{probable}} that Timothy {{was responsible for the}} name, as the Woodbridges had come from a neighboring town of Stockbridge, Hampshire. Due to its new status, town officers had to be elected, and Timothy was chosen for town clerk. One of the conditions of the grant was that four new English families be allowed to settle there, and Timothy's brother Joseph, who became an important citizen, soon joined him. This same year, Timothy was involved in a land swap with the Indians, trading 280 acres of riverfront land in Stockbridge for some 4000 acres in what is now the city of Lenox, his part of which was 480 acres. In 1743, the Mahicans wrote to Governor Shirley, asking that lands be confirmed to Timothy and Ephraim Williams, Jr., and the next year, Timothy sold some of his land granted by the General Court to Ephraim, Sr.|$|E

25|$|Like {{any sexual}} contact, extramarital sex opens the {{possibility}} of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives, STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriersto openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited. The World Health Organisation (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they thought they have been infected.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his lack}} of a clear {{strategy}} and political experience, however, Torres soon alienated all sectors of Bolivian society. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to organize groups on the left because they confronted him with demands {{that he could not}} meet, such as giving them half of all cabinet seats. The workers, students, and parties of the left wanted a socialist state and saw the Torres government only as a step in that direction. In June 1970, the Torres regime established the Popular Assembly (Asamblea Popular) in an attempt to form an alternative popular government. Consisting mainly of representatives of workers' and peasants' organizations, the Popular Assembly was intended to serve as a base for the radical transformation of society. However, the left remained divided by ideological differences and rivalry for leadership. They could not agree on controversial issues dealing with full worker participation in state and private enterprises, the creation of armed militias, and the establishment of popular tribunals having legal jurisdiction over crimes against the working class. No consensus was achieved, and many delegates, resenting the lack of power to enforce the resolutions and running short of funds, returned home prematurely. The Popular Assembly did, however, succeed in weakening the government by creating a climate in which popular organizations acted independently from the state.|$|E
