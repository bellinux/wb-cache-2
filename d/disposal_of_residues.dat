Flue gas emission, oxygen usage and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> (plasmastone) are the major environmental burdens, while electricity production and metal recovery represent the major benefits. Reductions in burdens and improvements in benefits are found when the plasmastone is valorised in building materials instead of landfilling.

Maximum adsorption (Ads max) ranged from 260 - 2818 mg kg- 1 (topsoil) to 532 - 1541 mg kg- 1 (subsoil). Nickel affinity (K L) was higher in the subsoil samples (0. 022 - 0. 236 L kg- 1) than in topsoil (0. 003 - 0. 049 L kg- 1). Adsorption envelopes showed sharp increase in Ni adsorption (20 - 90 %) in the 4. 0 - 6. 0 pH range. Nickel adsorption was affected by I and specific adsorption predominated in the 3. 0 - 5. 0 pH range, while above pH 5. 0, it was adsorbed by electrostatic mechanisms. Negative values of free energy variation (&# 916;G) and the separation factor K R< 1 indicated that Ni adsorption reaction was favorable and occurred spontaneously, especially when pH increase.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology for environmentally safe dry <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> bauxite <b>residues</b> in abandoned mine open pits. The methodology includes dewatering and controlled <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> bauxite <b>residues,</b> capping with waste rock or treated bauxite residues and, finally, development of a vegetation cover. This methodology is mainly based on bauxite residue properties, which possess low hydraulic conductivity if compacted at optimum moisture content. Several parts of this scheme were investigated at laboratory and pilot field scale. Simulation of an abandoned mine that was planned to be rehabilitated was also performed. Based on the results obtained, the main risk due to bauxite residues disposal is associated with the alkalinity of the material and initially high Na and Al concentrations in the leachate that progressively decrease due to the depletion of these elements.

In recent years, many techniques were proposed to improve the characteristics of these wastes with the aim to use them for methane generation in anaerobic digestion processes. Nevertheless, these techniques, in many cases, result costly as well as difficult to perform. In the present work, a simple and useful process that exploits H 2 O 2 in conjunction with lime is developed to enhance the anaerobic biodegradability of wet olive mill wastes (WMOW). Several tests were performed to investigate the influence of lime amount and H 2 O 2 addition modality. The treatment efficiency was positively affected by the increase of lime dosage and by the sequential addition of hydrogen peroxide. The developed process allows reaching phenols abatements up to 80 % and volatile fatty acids productions up to 90 % by using H 2 O 2 and Ca(OH) 2 amounts of 0. 05 gH 2 O 2 /gCOD and 35 g/L, respectively. The results of many batch anaerobic digestion tests, carried out by means of laboratory equipment, proved that the biogas production from fresh wet olive mill wastes is hardly achievable.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{state of}} the art {{at the beginning of the}} project was such that elution tests had to be improved by the realisation of the in-situ-conditions. The laboratory tests had to be adapted to the environment of the underground mining nad minefilling activities in German hard coal mines in the Ruhr district. For the simulation of the in-situ-conditions it was necessary to improve standard test methods and to develop new elution tests. Especially the application of pressure, temperature and contact of the residues with mine waters was of interest in the laboratory tests. It could be proved that there are different results between standard methods and the chosen test conditions. The elevation of pressure adn temperature leads to lower hydraulic conductivities and higher specific heavy metal discharges in the most cases. This can be significantly reduced by using binding agents. For the underground <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> from waste incinerator plants it is necessary to include the in-situ-conditions and die long-term chemical environment into laboratory tests.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although nickel (Ni) {{has both}} {{important}} potential benefits and toxic {{effects in the}} environment, its behavior in tropical soils has not been well studied. Nickel adsorption-desorption in topsoil and subsoil samples of an acric Oxisol was studied at three pH values (from 3. 0 to 8. 0). Adsorption-desorption isotherms were elaborated from experiments with increasing Ni concentration (5 to 100 mg L- 1), during 0, 4, and 12 weeks, using CaCl 2 0. 01 and 0. 1 M as electrolytic support in order to also verify the effect of Ni-soil time contact and of ionic strength on the reaction. Experimental results of Ni adsorption fitted Langmuir model, which indicated that maximum Ni adsorption (71, 440 mg kg- 1) occurred at subsoil, after 12 weeks. Nickel affinity (KL) was also greater at subsoil (1. 0 L kg- 1). The Ni adsorption in the topsoil samples was higher, due to its lower point of zero salt effect (PZSE) and higher organic matter content. The increase in soil pH resulted in the increase of Ni adsorption. Nickel desorbed less from soil samples incubated for 4 or 12 weeks, suggesting that Ni interactions with colloidal particles increase over time. The amount of Ni desorbed increased with increasing ionic strength in both the topsoil and subsoil soil samples. Finally, adsorption-desorption hysteresis was clearly observed. Soil pH, ionic strength of soil solution and the Ni-soil contact time {{should be considered as}} criteria for selecting the areas for <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> containing Ni or to compose remediation strategies for acric soils contaminated with Ni...|$|E

So, this work had as objective the evaluation of the reduction of fecal coliforms, after controlled applications of 60 days treated effluent in cultivated soil, by analyzing the increase of fluorescent rhizobacterias Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus spp. present in the rhizospheres of different crops.

However, use of acid requires a considerable equipment investment as well as <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues.</b> Acid-functionalized nanoparticles were synthesized for pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to increase conversion efficiency at mild conditions. Advantages of using acid-functionalized metal nanoparticles are not only the acidic properties to catalyze hydrolysis and being small enough to penetrate into the lignocellulosic structure, but also being easily separable from hydrolysis residues by using a strong magnetic field. Cobalt spinel ferrite magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized using a microemulsion method and then covered {{with a layer of}} silica to protect them from oxidation. The silanol groups of the silica serve as the support of the sulfonic acid groups that were later attached {{to the surface of the}} nanoparticles. TEM images and FTIR methods were used to characterize the properties of acid-functionalized nanoparticles in terms of nanoparticle size, presence of sulfonic acid functional groups, and pH as an indicator of acid sites present. Citric acid-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles were also synthesized and evaluated. Wheat straw and wood fiber samples were treated with the acid supported nanoparticles at 80 °C for 24 h to hydrolyze their hemicellulose fraction to sugars. Further hydrolysis of the liquid fraction was carried out to account for the amount of total solubilized sugars. HPLC was used to determine the total amount of sugars obtained in the aqueous solution. The perfluroalkyl-sulfonic acid functional groups from the magnetic nanoparticles yielded significantly higher amounts of oligosaccharides from wood and wheat straw samples than the alkyl-sulfonic acid functional groups did.

The compost is made by mixing cereal straw, animal manure, calcium and nitrogen supplements and the some other additives (Konko et al. 2001; Kaul and Dhar 2007). The residual spent straw, from mushroom harvesting, could be rich of microorganisms, extra cellular enzymes and contained relatively a high level of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and trace elements notably iron and silicon (Ball and Jackson 1995).|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{processes}} {{fall between}} the two traditional categories of chemical and biological treatment systems since they involve chemical reactions based on the action of biological catalysts. A variety of enzymes from plants and microorganisms {{have been reported to}} play important roles in an array of waste treatment applications. Before the full potential of enzymes may be realized, a number of significant issues remain to be addressed. These include: development of low-cost sources of enzymes in quantities that are required at the industrial scale; demonstration of the feasibility of utilizing enzymes efficiently under the conditions encountered during wastewater treatment; characterization of reaction products and assessment of their impact on downstream processes or on the environment in which they are released; and identification of methods for the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> solid <b>residues,</b> among others...|$|R
