5|$|The King {{immediately}} {{proved himself}} a conscientious worker. His first Prime Minister Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, {{stated that he}} had done more business with King William <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> than he had with George IV in as many days. Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter—whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.|$|E
5|$|Voss scored rapidly during February and March 1917; of the 15 {{victories}} {{credited to}} his jasta (squadron) during March, 11 fell under his guns. For his feats, {{he was awarded}} the Knight's Cross with Swords of the House Order of Hohenzollern on 17 March. The following day, Voss downed two British aircraft <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> The first one burned; the second aircrew downed protested they had been strafed by Voss after crashlanding within German lines.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... <b>In</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|In February 1915, Agamemnon {{was ordered}} to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 9 February, and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros 10 days later. That was {{the second day of the}} opening bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles and the ship immediately joined the attack. She also took part in the subsequent bombardment of the inner forts later in February. Agamemnon was hit by seven 240-millimetre (9.4-inch) shells <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> on 25 February and was holed above the waterline, suffering three dead.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. Some praised it and deemed it a spectacle, while others believed it lacked profundity and portrayal of Cyrus' personality. The Wonder World Tour was commercially successful despite the financial recession that {{was present in}} 2009. It was able to sell-out all European dates <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> and marks the largest attendance at The O2 Arena in London. During {{the first leg of}} the tour, one bus overturned several times on a highway. The accident resulted in the injury of one person and the death of another. The cause of the accident is yet to be specified, yet multiple theories for it exist. A filtered version of the Wonder World Tour was broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on June 18, 2010 and received a total of over 2.6 million viewers. The full-length concert film was released on the limited, deluxe edition of Cyrus' third studio album Can't Be Tamed (2010).|$|E
5|$|Brodie and Hall {{opened the}} Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> before Brodie was caught at long off by Tabart and was {{replaced}} by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Phillpot was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Roger Phillpot, who scored just a single, was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.|$|E

25|$|Observation {{of radio}} {{propagation}} beacons operating around 28.2MHz, 50MHz and 70MHz, indicates that {{maximum observed frequency}} (MOF) for Es {{is found to be}} lurking around 30MHz on most days during the summer season, but sometimes MOF may shoot up to 100MHz or even more <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> to decline slowly during the next few hours. The peak-phase includes oscillation of MOF with periodicity of approximately 5...10 minutes. The propagation range for Es single-hop is typically 1000 to 2000km, but with multi-hop, double range is observed. The signals are very strong but also with slow deep fading.|$|E
25|$|Like the old Wäinämöinen, Jääkarhu had a heeling {{system with}} two pumps capable of {{transferring}} 650 tons of ballast water per hour between side tanks, heeling the vessel {{up to five}} degrees <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> In addition, she had six centrifugal pumps for moving 100 tons of water in five minutes between the fore and aft peak tanks to adjust her trim and release the icebreaker from compressive ice. For escort operations she had a towing winch and a stern notch that was considerably larger than in the older icebreakers. Her single piece cast iron rudder weighed 9 tons.|$|E
25|$|Adam Johnson was {{recalled}} {{from his}} successful loan spell at Watford (where he scored 5 goals in 11 games) {{in time for}} the home game versus Aston Villa. He was immediately restored to the starting line-up, beginning the game on the left with Downing moving up front. Boro started well but conceded just before half time, and again just after the break, with the third going <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> later. Astonishingly despite the 0–3 defeat, Middlesbrough avoided dropping into the bottom three: Bolton won versus Manchester United and moved out of the drop zone, but Sunderland's 1–7 defeat at Everton dropped them below the Boro on goal difference.|$|E

25|$|For the Hazelwood Park census area, {{like most}} Australian areas, {{transport}} is primarily car based, with on average 1.56 cars per household. This is typified in that 68.5% of all residents {{drive to work}} and only 5.8% were passengers. Traffic congestion is relatively light in Hazelwood Park and only occurs during peak periods on the two main thoroughfares, Greenhill and Glynburn Roads. The city can typically be reached <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes,</b> and fifteen in peak periods using Greenhill Road. Like most Adelaide suburbs, the major roads have a 60km/h speed limit and the side streets a 50km/h limit. Hazelwood Park's road network (with few exceptions) follows the usual Adelaide grid pattern.|$|E

25|$|On 6 November, {{the units}} of Fliegerführer Atlantik engaged OG 76 in a month-long battle, which lasted until 16 December. The convoy had left Liverpool bund for Gibraltar on 28 October. Sighted by KG 40 on 6 November, six Fw 200s were to shadow and direct U-Boats to it. HMS Audacity was present, and {{launched}} her fighters against the Condors, downing one Fw 200. Five U-Boats were guided in, but were repulsed by the escorts and the convoy {{which made it}} to Gibraltar unscathed. On 14 December it returned to Liverpool. By 16 December, KG 40 had picked it up. The U-Boats were repulsed again, and the Fw 200s were forced to retreat under fighter attack on 18 December. On 19 December, two Condors were lost to Audacity's fighters. With the Condors out of the battle, the U-Boats tried on their own, sinking one destroyer and two merchant ships. On 21 December, Audacity was spotted outside the convoy and was sunk <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes.</b> Five of her six fighter pilots from No. 802 Squadron FAA were saved.

25|$|On 1 July 1942, Stahlschmidt {{was himself}} {{promoted}} to Staffelkapitän of 2./JG27. This {{same day the}} First Battle of El Alamein began. On the morning of 4 July 1942 Stahlschmidt claimed four victories in the El Alamein area—three on a morning mission {{and one in the}} late afternoon. In the morning battle Stahlschmidt, with Feldwebel Günther Steinhausen flying as his wingman, dived to attack and shot down Major Lemmie Le Mesurier and Lieutenant Powell of 1 Squadron SAAF. Mesurier was wounded in action. JG27 lost the 36-victory ace Körner who was shot down and captured. The following day he claimed a Gloster Gladiator. The claim cannot be confirmed through British records. Only the 1411 Meteorological Flight was equipped with the aircraft. It may have been an Italian Fiat CR.42 as Regia Aeronautica units were active on this date. The claim was his 27th victory. On 8 July he made another three claims in the space of eight minutes. Two of the claims can be identified from No. 33 Squadron RAF. Pilot Officer Wigle and Sergeant Morris were killed in action. His tally now stood at 26. On a patrol near El Alamein on 10 July, Stahlschmidt shot down two P-40s and a Hurricane <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> <b>minutes</b> to inflate his tally to 33. His adversaries in the battle were from 80, 92 and 127 Squadron RAF. Over the next twelve days he added three more claims. On 22 July Stahlschmidt claimed another three—two P-40s in the morning sorties and a Hurricane in the afternoon. Pilot Officer Barrow was one of his victims, killed in action.|$|E
