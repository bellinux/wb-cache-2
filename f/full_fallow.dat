This study explored the possibility of adding a cover crop in the rotation to improve grain yield. There was also a replication of a large on-farm compost treatment of 18 Mg/ha (dry) for comparison. Cover crops were selected based on a fall-planted study. Treatments included birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) with inoculants planted at 20 kg/ha, Austrian winter peas (Pisum sativum subsp. arvense) with inoculants planted at 36 kg/ha, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) with inoculants planted at 50 kg/ha, and Deloris hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) planted at 55 kg/ha. Morgan Dairy compost was applied at 18 Mg/ha (dry). A control plot was included and received no treatment {{as it would be}} in a regular fallow season. There was significant biomass for the Austrian winter pea which leads to the realistic viability of incorporating a legume. However, the yield of the grain for each of the cover crop treatments was significantly lower than the grain planted without a cover crop. It is not reasonable to incorporate a cover crop in the current rotation with a <b>full</b> <b>fallow</b> season. Interestingly, incorporating compost increased protein by as much as one percent. As expected, incorporating an additional growth cycle negatively impacted grain yield. Adding a growing cycle into the rotation decreased the yield by more than 50...|$|E
40|$|Cover or {{catch crops}} have {{beneficial}} effects for soil, water, erosion, etc. If harvested, {{they also provide}} feedstock for biogas without competition for arable land in regions, where only one main crop can be produced per year. On average gross energy yields of approx. 1300 m³ methane (CH 4) ha- 1 can be expected from 4. 5 tonnes (t) of cover crop dry matter (DM) in Austria. Considering the total energy invested from cultivation to compression for biofuel use a net energy yield of about 1000 m³ CH 4 ha- 1 is remaining. With the straw of grain maize or Corn Cob Mix (CCM) similar energy yields can be achieved. In comparison to catch crops remaining on the field as green manure or to complete fallow between main crops the effects on soil, water and climate can be improved if cover crops are harvested without soil compaction and digestate is returned to the field in an amount equivalent to cover crop removal. In this way, the risk of nitrate leaching can be reduced approx. by 25 % in comparison to <b>full</b> <b>fallow.</b> The risk of nitrous oxide emissions may be reduced up to 50 % by contrast with cover crops serving as green manure. The effects on humus content and erosion are similar or better than those of cover crops used as green manure when {{the same amount of}} biomass was produced. With higher biomass production the positive effects increase even if cover crops are harvested and the only digestate is brought back to the fields. The ecological footprint of arable farming can be reduced by approx. 50 % considering the substitution of natural gas with CH 4 produced from cover crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of long fallowing, by omitting {{a year of}} cropping, is gaining renewed focus in the low rainfall zone of the northern agriculture region of Western Australia. The impetus behind this practice change has been a reduced use of pasture breaks in cereal crop rotations, {{and the belief that}} a fallow can improve soil water accumulation and thus buffer the negative effects of dry seasons on crop yields. We evaluated the benefits of long <b>fallowing</b> (<b>full</b> stubble retention, no weed growth allowed) in a continuous wheat sequence via simulation modelling with APSIM at two rainfall locations and five soil types. The simulated benefits to long fallowing were attributable to soil water accumulation only, as the effects on soil nitrogen, diseases or weeds were not evaluated. The long-term (100 years) mean wheat yield benefit to fallowing was 0. 36 - 0. 43 Â t/ha in clay, 0. 20 - 0. 23 Â t/ha in sand and loam, and 0 - 0. 03 Â t/ha in shallow sand and shallow loams. Over the range of seasons simulated the response varied from - 0. 20 to 3. 87 Â t/ha in the clay and - 0. 48 to 2. 0 Â t/ha for the other soils. The accumulation of soil water and associated yield benefits occurred in 30 - 40 % of years on better soils and only 10 - 20 % on poorer soils. For the loam soil, the majority of the yield increases occurred when the growing-season (May-September) rainfall following the fallow was low (30 Â mm), although yield increase did occur with other combinations of growing-season rainfall and soil water. Over several years of a crop sequence involving fallow and wheat, the benefits from long fallowing due to greater soil water accumulation did not offset yield lost from omitting years from crop production, although the coefficient of variation for inter-annual farm grain production was reduced, particularly on clay soils during the 1998 - 2007 decade of below-average rainfall. We conclude that under future drying climates in Western Australia, fallowing may {{have a role to play}} in buffering the effects of enhanced inter-annual variability in rainfall. Investigations are required on the management of fallows, and management of subsequent crops (i. e. sowing earlier and crop density) so as to maximise yield benefits to subsequent crops while maintaining groundcover to prevent soil erosion.
