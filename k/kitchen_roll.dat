Participants turned <b>kitchen</b> <b>rolls</b> either clockwise or counterclockwise while answering items from a questionnaire assessing openness to experience. Data from 102 participants showed that the effect went slightly in the direction opposite to that predicted by Topolinski and Sparenberg (2012), and a preregistered Bayes factor hypothesis test revealed that the data were 10. 76 times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis. Our findings illustrate the theoretical importance and practical advantages of preregistered Bayes factor replication studies, both for psychological science and for empirical work in general...|$|R

All thermal receipt paper samples (n = 111) contained BPS at concentrations ranging from 0. 0000138 to 22. 0 mg/g (geometric mean: 0. 181 mg/g). The overall mean concentrations of BPS in thermal receipt papers were similar to the concentrations reported earlier for BPA in the same set of samples. A significant negative correlation existed between BPS and BPA concentrations in thermal receipt paper samples (r = - 0. 55, p 88 %).

5000|$|Public disfavour {{came to a}} head on Friday 10 April. At around 5:15pm {{a police}} constable spotted a black youth named Michael Bailey running towards him, {{apparently}} away from three other black youths. Bailey was stopped and found to be badly bleeding, but broke away from the constable. Stopped again on Atlantic Road, Bailey was found to have a four-inch stab wound. Bailey ran into a flat and was helped by a family and the police constable there by putting <b>kitchen</b> <b>roll</b> on his wound. A crowd gathered and, as the police then tried to take the wounded boy to a waiting minicab on Railton Road, the crowd tried to intervene thinking the police {{did not appear to be}} providing or seeking the medical help Bailey needed quickly enough. As the minicab pulled away at speed a police car arrived and stopped the cab. When an officer from the police car realised Bailey was injured he moved him into the back of the police car to take him to hospital more quickly, and bound his wound more tightly to stop the bleeding. A group of 50 youths began to shout for Bailey's release thinking the police were arresting him. [...] "Look, theyâ€™re killing him," [...] claimed one. The crowd descended on the police car and pulled him out although the officers were trying to take him to hospital. The youths dispatched him to hospital and told officers: [...] "Let us look after our own." ...|$|E
40|$|Think {{about the}} {{products}} you repeatedly buy {{at the grocery}} store â€“ toilet paper is probably a major item on the list, right? The European market for tissues, which includes the production of tissue paper, paper towels, toilet paper, and paper for industrial use, annually moves a turnover of around 10 billion euros a year. The European Tissue Symposium (ETS), an organization that brings together European producers, including the Portuguese Renova, estimates that the market will continue to grow at a rate of 3 % per year and in emerging markets can advance more than 7 % per year. Low cost products are no longer an option for Portugal, since today other can produce them even at a lower price. As a fast moving brand, pioneer in launching innovative products â€“ antibacterial <b>kitchen</b> <b>roll,</b> black toilet paper, and wet toilet paper, â€“ Renova is perceived different in the market and able to create consumption patterns. The company accounts for a turnover of about 130 million euros, today is present in 60 countries with 600 workers and produces about 100, 000 tons of paper per year. This essayâ€™s focus is on the point of sale, nowadays undergoing a fundamental and strategic role in the retailersâ€™ actions, driving the creation of new retail concepts. Being one of the main contact bridges between the trademark and the consumer, it embraces direct implications on their mutual relationship. More and more companies are realizing the strategic importance of trade marketing operations. For Renova, producing an innovative, smoother and dermatological tested toilet paper is not enough; itâ€™s necessary for the market to recognize it. Through a case study about an essential commodity available on a large scale in a mass market, this research findings demonstrate how point of sale strategies can be decisive during the purchase process when several and diverse competitors act in the same segment make almost impossible to compare prices on the spot...|$|E

60|$|The lonely {{traveller}} {{with the}} stomach-ache {{had all this}} time suffered severely, drawing up a leg now and then, and sipping hot brandy-and-water with grated ginger in it. When we tasted our (very) mock-turtle soup, and were instantly seized with symptoms of some disorder simulating apoplexy, and occasioned by the surcharge of nose and brain with lukewarm dish-water holding in solution sour flour, poisonous condiments, and (say) seventy-five per cent. of miscellaneous <b>kitchen</b> stuff <b>rolled</b> into balls, we were inclined to trace his disorder to that source. On the other hand, there was a silent anguish upon him too strongly resembling the results established within ourselves by the sherry, to be discarded from alarmed consideration. Again, we observed him, with terror, to be much overcome by our sole's being aired in a temporary retreat close to him, while the waiter went out (as we conceived) to see his friends. And when the curry made its appearance he suddenly retired in great disorder.|$|R

60|$|Then {{the deputy}} on the <b>kitchen</b> floor <b>rolled</b> over with an appalling snort, struggled, {{stretched}} himself, and awoke. A healthy animal, he had shaken off the fumes of liquor {{with a dry}} tongue and a thirst for water and fresh air. He raised his knees and rubbed his eyes. The water bucket was missing from the corner. Well, he knew where the spring was, and a turn out of the close and stifling kitchen would do him good. He yawned, put on his boots softly, opened the back door, and stepped out. Everything was dark, but above and around him, to the very level of his feet, all apparently pricked with bright stars. The bulk of the barn rose dimly before him on the right, to the left was the spring. He reached it, drank, dipped his head and hands in it, and arose refreshed. The dry, wholesome breath that blew over this flat disk around him, rimmed with stars, did the rest. He began to saunter slowly back, the only reminiscence of his evening's potations being the figure he recalled of his pretty hostess, with bare arms and lifted glasses, imitating the barkeeper. A complacent smile straightened his yellow mustache. How she kept glancing at him and watching him, the little witch! Ha! no wonder! What could she find in the surly, slinking, stupid brute yonder? (The gentleman here alluded to was his host.) But the deputy had not been without a certain provincial success with the fair. He was true to most men, and fearless to all. One may not be too hard upon him at this moment of his life.|$|R

So now {{he is going to}} walk to Cincinnati to see him. He knows he will not be turned away if he can once meet his son, face to face.

5000|$|Tom {{is furious}} and creeps {{up to the}} window. Then, the curtain is drawn and Jerry holds out a sign reading [...] "Jerry, the Dancing Mouse". Jerry dances {{the way he did}} earlier, taunting Tom. Tom reaches for the garden hose while {{watching}} the presentation and then opens the window and blasts Jerry with the hose. Tom chases Jerry and traps him under a teapot. Joan hears the noise and enters the <b>kitchen</b> as Jerry <b>rolls</b> in a tub of flour and turns himself white. She asks Tom if he's got the white mouse under the teapot and Tom lifts it up revealing a white Jerry. Joan slaps Tom with the broom, scolding him. Tom runs away and finds a fireplace bellows. He surprises Jerry and blows off the flour on his lower torso. Tom gives chase and Jerry tears shreds off a broom when Joan spots Jerry, who does a fan dance and hides his brown parts. Tom sneaks up behind Jerry and blows off all the flour after she leaves. Jerry hides in a closet and Tom tries to force entry until he is whacked by Joan. Tom turns the tables on Joan by snatching the broom from her grasp and breaking it in two, leaving her speechless and she watches as he triumphantly opens the cupboard door, to point at Jerry, who jumps out - but he's white again! Tom's eyes pop out and Tom has to punish himself by hitting himself with {{the top half of the}} broom until he's out of sight. He sees Jerry kiss a bottle of shoe polish and is distraught until he sees a can of white paint in the garage. Tom paints himself white and comes back. He rings the doorbell and holds out a sign that says [...] "Tom the Dancing Cat" [...] to a startled Joan. Tom dances just like Jerry and charms Joan. Under the impression that the cat was simply jealous of her white mouse (and Tom gives a lying nod to keep giving her this impression), Joan lets Tom in, but makes him promise to be friends with Jerry. She leaves, and Tom stomps on Jerry repeatedly while dancing.|$|R
