5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is an <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> (and, in some cases, a superconductor), {{allowing it to}} be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is {{a silvery}} white, weakly {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive and a poor <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor.</b> Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor.</b> Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E

5|$|Elemental boron is a {{metalloid}} that {{is found}} in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|Sodium forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor.</b> Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.|$|E

25|$|Johnson–Nyquist noise (thermal noise, Johnson noise, or Nyquist noise) is the {{electronic}} noise {{generated by the}} thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the electrons) inside an <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied voltage.

25|$|Electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper, a high-purity copper that {{contains}} oxygen as an alloying agent, represents {{the bulk of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> applications because of its high electrical conductivity and improved annealability. ETP copper is used for power transmission, power distribution, and telecommunications. Common applications include building wire, motor windings, electrical cables, and busbars. Oxygen-free coppers are used to resist hydrogen embrittlement when extensive amounts of cold work is needed, and for applications requiring higher ductility (e.g., telecommunications cable). When hydrogen embrittlement is a concern and low electrical resistivity is not required, phosphorus may be added to copper.|$|E

The exothermic reaction is triggered in a reactive layer stack (1). The reactive layer stack and the insulation layers are connected with each other such that the insulation layers are disintegrated due to thermal energy released by the reactive layer stack during the exothermic reaction and an electrical connection is produced between the <b>electrical</b> <b>conductors.</b> An independent claim is included for an electrical energy storage device...|$|R
25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E
25|$|In {{telegraphy}} and telephony, {{a lightning}} arrester is a device placed where wires enter a structure, {{in order to}} prevent damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near the structures. Lightning arresters, also called surge protectors, are devices that are connected between each <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> in a power or communications system, and the ground. They help prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high-voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Arresters are used to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike.|$|E
25|$|A charged object brought {{close to}} an {{electrically}} neutral object causes a separation of charge within the neutral object. Charges of the same polarity are repelled and charges of the opposite polarity are attracted. As the force due to the interaction of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance, {{the effect of the}} closer (opposite polarity) charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction. The effect is most pronounced when the neutral object is an <b>electrical</b> <b>conductor</b> as the charges are more free to move around. Careful grounding of part of an object with a charge-induced charge separation can permanently add or remove electrons, leaving the object with a global, permanent charge. This process is integral to the workings of the Van de Graaff generator, a device commonly used to demonstrate the effects of static electricity.|$|E
