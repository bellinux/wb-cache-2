Malaysia has been developing water board at National and State Level. Although the two countries differed in governmental arrangements, the locus used in this research experienced {{the same level of}} governments. Verstehen has been as a general framework of this research approach. Qualitative and descriptive were the method of this research. Data are gathered using eclectic-triangulation methods andanalyzed with multilevel tools. This research concluded that the tertiary irrigation in those three locus in Indonesia werenot established based on <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization,</b> eventhough it has potential to do so. It is different from Malaysia which is fully centralized through deconcentration. Only the teritorial decentralization is the basic of tertiary irrigation management in Indonesia. <b>Functional</b> <b>decentralization</b> is not being practiced in tertiary irrigation management both in Indonesia and Malaysia. Empirically, Government should improve the performance of irrigation organization at the grassroot level in order to increase the whole agricultural performance which creating special local regime in the irrigation management. Furthermore, amandment to the constitution of 18 th article should induce the concept of <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization</b> that was practiced in Indonesian local government system in 1920...|$|E

Specified {{as a separate}} process of humanization of management systematizing the three components of the local government : political, economic and <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization.</b> Targets of self-admiration regarding local development are considered. Attention is paid to {{the reasons for the}} weakness of local governments of Ukraine. Accented that the main objective of local government is providing of local development focused on community. The measures to be implemented by local governments in the context of local development are systematized. It is emphasized the inadmissibility of the absolute autonomy of local governments in conditions the weakening of the central government.

40|$|Net of {{settlements}} of municipality Smederevo consists of Smederevo city and 26 rural settlements. It is a subsystem of the Belgrade metropolitan region. It has 120, 000 inhabitants, and 70, 000 of them live in town. From 1960 to 2000 {{it passes through}} phase of intensive demographic and functional transformation. Processes of demographic redistribution, deagrarization and urbanization are especially emphasized, caused by polarization influence of Smederevo city. From 1960 to 1980 population was developing by natural and migration components, but in villages occurred emigration of young population and caused increased average of older people and intensive decrease of population growth, which became negative. Demographic growth occurs only in periurban settlements, while stagnation and depopulation are typical for other settlements. Process of functional transformation {{of settlements}} is apparent also. Relative single functionality with dominant industry and slow diversification function are characteristic for Smederevo city, while villages are transforming from pure rural to rural-industrial and rural-obliging. It caused their progressive urbanization that is especially expressed in periurban settlements and along main traffic communications. In following period the aim is demographic and <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization</b> of net of settlements, by taking planning measures according to the model of center of villages group...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia’s National Constitution {{and human}} rights {{convention}} require each and every Indonesia citizen to have decent housings. Throughout history, however, the realization of this mandate has never been satisfying yet. More over, such a mandate is {{even more difficult to}} achieve as it relates closely with decentralization, in terms of either <b>functional</b> or territorial <b>decentralization.</b> In this research these decentralization types are examined with respect to its institutional aspects through a qualitative research involving such data collection techniques as in-depth interview, documentation and life history. This research attempts to answer some questions: (1) How do housing policies is regulated concerning those of <b>functional</b> and territorial <b>decentralizations?</b> (2) How is the implementation of housing policy at middle-low income households? (3) What are the most potential factors affecting the fullfilment of decent housing for middle-low income community? The research recommends that the Government of the Republic of Indonesia should: (i) strengthen its political will towards decents housing for all; (ii) enhance regulation concerning decentralization; (iii) reform housing institutions at autonomous regions; and (iv) amplify strategic partnership between the National Housin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an approach for the multi-agent navigation {{and conflict resolution}} problem, that considers the issue of performance. We present a decentralized predictive navigation scheme that combines the Decentralized Navigation Functions methodology with the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework while preserving the former’s collision avoid-ance and convergence guarantees. Aircrafts flying at constant altitude are modeled as unicycles. Performance criteria are encoded in a cost <b>functional.</b> Due to <b>decentralization,</b> each agent {{does not take into}} account the decisions of others in the control law calculation, resulting in performance discrepancies. There-fore we employ event-triggered executions in our scheme. The improved performance is demonstrated through simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|This study uses a {{panel of}} sixty-four {{countries}} to test empirically various hypotheses {{about the causes of}} decentralization at the government level and in different functional spending areas. The empirical results find a negative impact of urbanization on decen-tralization. In the general case, a higher income per capita favors decentralization, with this effect being stronger for high-income countries. However, the use of <b>functional</b> mea-surements of <b>decentralization</b> shows that income per capita has a negative effect on health decentralization. Urbanization has a negative impact on the fiscal decentraliza-tion of health and education, and it has a positive effect on the share of housing expendi-tures being made by subnational governments...|$|R
40|$|Full {{implementation}} {{of human rights}} requires {{a wide range of}} initiatives, many of which fall beyond the expertise of the UN human rights "mainland," consisting of the Human Rights Council, treaty-bodies, and Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Specialized agencies, funds, programs, and other UN bodies have an indispensable role to play if the UN system is to engage with the entire spectrum of human rights implementation. Their role encompasses all human rights but is especially critical in relation to economic, social, and cultural rights. The Human Rights Council and OHCHR are mandated to promote human rights mainstreaming which is a precondition for full implementation. However, UN systemwide mainstreaming runs into the principles of <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization</b> and autonomy which are woven into the fabric of the UN. Accordingly, human rights have to be "owned" by each agency and similar UN body. There is today an emerging "archipelago" of human rights initiatives, lying beyond the UN human rights mainland, in agencies and other UN bodies. The contemporary UN human rights system should be configured as the mainland and archipelago and the article outlines ways to promote its appropriate development, including new working methods for the Human Rights Council...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the very}} large number of local units in the Republic of Croatia, the system of {{collecting}} income is mainly insufficient for quality and functional financing of public needs on the local and regional levels. It is therefore necessary to continue the search for new models of regulating financial relations between the state and local units. The executed decentralization of the financing of local and regional self-government is not sufficient. Because of the new work and activities that have fallen into the jurisdiction of counties (as regulated by Amendments to the Act from 2005), it is necessary to increase the state’ s allocation of funds from common taxes for the units of the local and regional self-government, to increase the autonomy of the local and regional units in the introduction of their own incomes, especially taxes, to take care about the implementation of <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization,</b> and to stimulate local and regional governments in the realization of a larger non-fiscal income of their own. It is a fact that some countries in the European Union have begun with the reorganization and reduction of their local self-government precisely because of too high financial payments for the needs of the local self-government. However, so long as the Republic of Croatia retains the existing organization of local governments, it should also provide for its financing. The local or regional self-government units’ own sources of income should be their principal sources of financing. ...|$|E
40|$|Following {{unprecedented}} earthquakes in 1999, highly centralized Turkey initiated {{reforms that}} aimed to improve disaster management collaboration and to empower local authorities. In 2011, two earthquakes hit the country anew affecting {{the city of}} Van and town of Erciş in Turkey’s southeast. In attempts to reduce disaster risk, global disaster risk reduction frameworks and disaster scholars and practitioners advocate collaborative and decentralized disaster management strategies. This thesis investigates how such strategies are received in a centralized and hierarchical national political-administrative system that largely is the anti-thesis of the prescribed solutions. More specifically, this research investigates the barriers and prerequisites for disaster management collaboration between both public and civil society actors in Turkey (during preparedness, response, and recovery) {{as well as how}} Turkey’s political-administrative system affects disaster management collaboration and its outcomes. The challenges to decentralization of disaster management are also investigated. Based on forty-four interviews with actors ranging from national to village level and NGOs, the findings suggest that the political-administrative system can alter the relative importance, validity, and applicability of previously established enabling or constraining conditions for collaboration. This may in turn challenge previous theoretical assumptions regarding collaboration. By adopting a mode of collaboration that fit the wider political-administrative system, collaborative disaster management progress was achieved in Turkey’s national level activities. Although there were exceptions, collaboration spanning sectors and/or administrative levels were generally less forthcoming, partly due to the disjoint character of the political-administrative system. Political divergence between local and central actors made central-local collaboration difficult but these barriers were partly trumped by other prerequisites enabling collaboration like interdependence and pre-existing relations. The findings suggest that the specific attributes of disasters may both help and hinder disaster management collaboration. Such collaboration generally improved disaster response. The findings also indicate that the decentralization attempts may have been premature as the conditions for ensuring a <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization</b> of disaster management are presently lacking. Decentralization attempts are commonly suggested to increase local capacity and local participation but the findings of this dissertation suggest that in Turkey, these commodities may currently have better chances of being increased by refraining from decentralization...|$|E
40|$|The {{first goal}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a {{taxonomy}} of decentralization measures showing their relationship to the primary theoretical aspects of decentralization and how the different measures are related to each other. The second goal of the paper is to argue convincingly that from an empirical analysis perspective the aggregation of those distinct dimensions of decentralization into a single indicator inevitably leads to a loss of information and that a preferable approach in multivariate frameworks is to enter these distinct aspects of decentralization in the regression analysis separately in the most flexible <b>functional</b> form possible. <b>Decentralization,</b> Taxonomy of decentralization, measures of decentralization...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{decentralized}} co-operative governance system, conditioned and regulated by the South African constitution is of critical importance for policy design and implementation. The division of powers falls within a unitary form of government. This study, {{which is about the}} processes, mechanisms and modalities of public policies design and implementation uses the public finance and health sectors, as a case study or lens through which policy design and implementation is examined within a decentralized cooperative governance system. The study is per se not about the public health system, but rather a review and an analysis about how the decentralization and cooperative governance nature, practice and dynamic of government system, influences and condition the policy processes and practice on finance and health, separately and collectively within the public health system. In its attempt to unbundle the health function, but also reform the public health system, central and provincial governments have introduced a number of reforms. These reforms were ostensibly driven by different policies and programmes originating either from the public finance or public health sectors with significant consequences for the provinces. Moreover, these different policies also outlined structural and functional responsibilities and authority among the central and provincial government departments. The implementation of these policies was at times based on different interpretations of policy design and implementation responsibilities and authority between the central and provincial governments within co-operative governance system. The argument {{of this study is that}} despite intentions implicit to public policy, co-operative governance system is contested at a central government level within the public health system, as well as between levels of government and the public health and finance sectors. This dissertation explores the nature of the relationship between the central and provincial governments by exploring co-operative governance in the health sector on policy and financing processes and mechanisms. The central question is how does decentralized co-operative governance really work in the public health system? A case study method was used to conduct this research. Data was collected over a four and half year period using a variety of data collection methods, including semi-structured in-depth interviews; documents and reports analyses; policy content review and analyses; and revenue and expenditure reviews and analyses. The study’s findings are: a) the <b>functional</b> and structural <b>decentralization</b> of policy-making and implementation within the co-operative governance system contributes to undermining the cooperative governance relationship between the public finance and health sector and central and provincial governments; b) the central government is using its overriding powers to “impose co-ordinated solutions” to problems within the co-operative governance system, leading to situations where ‘imposed co-ordination’ is considered as ‘co-operative governance’; c) the theory provides a classical distinction between state control, supervision and interference models. This dissertation shows that, depending on the policy context and circumstances, the uniqueness of South Africa’s co-operative governance system allows the central government to mobilize any of these models to achieve its policy intentions, whether written or unwritten; and d) the classical arguments of decentralization, particularly within a devolved system of co-operative governance where greater autonomy and authority are given to subnational governments, are found wanting within the South African governance system, given both the policy-making and fiscal resource strength of the central government relative to the provinces. This dissertation leads me to conclude that the South African practice of co-operative governance in the health system is actually imposed co-ordination and that provinces are de facto administration outposts of central government policies, programmes and service delivery responsibilities. Therefore in reality there is no autonomy and independence of the provinces from the central government as envisaged in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. In fact, provinces only exist, in terms of their constitutional competencies as far the central government allows it to exist given its plenipotentiary powers over both micro and macro matters affecting institutions, fiscus and social policies...|$|R

This study focuses on the relationship between the nature of public goods and the organization for their supply, in the particular context of stream pollution. The theoretical analysis of stream pollution as a negative externality and its abatement is further developed in a case study of one river basin, the Fox River, in Kane County in northern Illinois. Stream pollution was found to be a unique externality in that it is cumulative, mobile, and unidirectional, i. e., it always flows in one direction and, thus, downstream communities suffer from the pollution of any of the communities located upstream. The asymmetry of the externality prevents bargaining, while the cumulative effect rules out a noncoordinated action by a single community. Thus, government intervention is needed to supply the good in order to abate the externality. However, since water has more than a single usage, the question {{of the degree to which}} the water should be cleaned may create an inadequate abatement for communities with higher water quality needs than the standard, on the one hand, as well as new negative externalities of overinvestment for other communities which require a lesser degree of purity than the one imposed. The organization for supplying the good is complicated by the fact that the watershed boundaries usually do not overlap with administrative boundaries. Thus, a watershed-bound organization adds another jurisdiction to the already crowded political and administrative arena, while absence of such organization creates inefficiency due to hierarchical and <b>functional</b> <b>decentralization.</b> Pollution abatement also proved to be one of several tasks applied to a common source, i. e., the stream. The jointness-in-supply of tasks such as flood control, navigation, pollution abatement and minimum volume of water flow imposes the need to coordinate these tasks in order to prevent inefficiency and sometimes contradictory programs. Consequently, whatever the environmental, political, and technological aspects, four major issues have to be integrated in any stream-related program: the cumulative asymmetrical nature of the externality, hydrological vs. political boundaries, the multiattribute nature of pollution abatement, and the stream as a joint source of several water-related tasks...|$|E
