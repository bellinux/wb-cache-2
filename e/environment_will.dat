A {{key question is}} whether astronauts can have different sets of reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> transfer to others.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{emotional}} approach coping may {{signal to the}} social environment that an individual {{is in need of}} support. The responsiveness of the social <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> determine the adaptiveness {{of emotional}} approach coping. Emotional expression that is met with empathetic concern may lead to better adjustment than emotional expression met by rejection. Some evidence from the research suggests this could be a potential mechanism. For women with breast cancer who perceive their social environment to be highly receptive, coping through emotional expression predicts improved quality of life.|$|E
25|$|This {{evolution}} of the Dalek and Thal races is contradicted in the TV serial Genesis of the Daleks. The story depicts the Dalek progenitors as being a humanoid race called the Kaleds. They have been {{at war with the}} Thals for generations, turning Skaro into a wasteland devastated by chemical and nuclear weapons. While the Daleks and Thals have each engineered their own huge, protective dome in which to shelter, the disfigured victims of chemical and radioactive contamination are banished to roam the surface as ‘mutos’. The Kaled scientists realise that the planet's toxic <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> eventually cause the mutation of their species, bringing their genetic purity to an end. Their chief scientist, Davros, decides to accelerate the mutation to find the ultimate Kaled form, in the process 'improving' it by removing all traces of conscience, feeling and emotion. The resulting organisms are placed into armoured travel machines and referred to by Davros as Daleks.|$|E

25|$|As planned, {{the alpine}} ski run and luge racing area of 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games {{will be built}} in the core area of Beijing Songshan National Reserves. A great number of {{valuable}} species such as Lonicera oblata and Cypripedium shanxiense S. C. Chen are found here {{and many of them}} can not be conserved through ex situ conservation. Many Chinese professionals of biology and environmentalists deemed that if the Olympic venues are developed in such area, the rare species and integrated ecological <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> be catastrophically collapsed. Chinese government intended to remove such area out from the range of the natural reserves and chose some other area with few rare species as the reserves. Besides, the comments regarding the strict compliance with laws and protection of Songshan National Reserves are widely deleted or restricted in China. All these actions have been criticized by some media and the professionals of biology in China.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} transformation {{continued to increase}} in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting {{in a series of}} new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.|$|E
25|$|Blood flow to {{skin and}} fat are {{affected}} by skin and core temperature, and resting muscle perfusion {{is controlled by the}} temperature of the muscle itself. During exercise increased flow to the working muscles is often balanced by reduced flow to other tissues, such as kidneys spleen and liver. Blood flow to the muscles is also lower in cold water, but exercise keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion in cold water. Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs with cold water immersion. Variations in perfusion distribution do not necessarily affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in perfusion. Rest in a cold <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> reduce inert gas exchange from skin, fat and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present. Inert gas exchange is least favourable for the diver who is warm and exercises at depth during the ingassing phase, and rests and is cold during decompression.|$|E

25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E
500|$|While {{migration}} to more developed countries {{in search of}} better opportunities, also known as [...] "brain drain," [...] is partially responsible for the shortage of health care workers in Malawi, many health care workers have been personally affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic; in fact, an average of 48 nurses die of HIV/AIDS in Malawi every year. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has resulted in high levels of absenteeism among health workers in Malawi, who often leave work {{to spend time with}} HIV-positive friends or relatives, and the Malawian government has failed to respond to the declining number of full-time employees working in the health sector. Health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with the heavy patient loads or because they are afraid that working in a medical <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> increase their risk of becoming infected with HIV.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system was}} designed to allow players {{to have a lot}} of freedom. As a result, the team implemented the [...] "Golden 3C Rules", which represents Character, Control, and Camera. Players are always controlling their own actions and movements, and the team intentionally avoided any animation that would disrupt the players. As a result, actions such as setting explosives, or placing a breach charge, can be cancelled immediately so that players can react and shoot. The game's camera only moves when the player moves, as the team feared that the changes of camera angle may lead to players' in-game deaths. A free-lean system was introduced to the game so that players can have more control on their line of sight. According to Ubisoft, this input-driven control mechanism makes the game feel more [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "fluid". This is because it allows players to concentrate on planning and coordinating, rather than thinking if the camera or <b>environment</b> <b>will</b> interfere their actions.|$|E

5000|$|The action-specific {{perception}} account has {{roots in}} Gibson's (1979) ecological approach to perception. [...] According to Gibson, the primary objects of perception are affordances, {{which are the}} possibilities for action. Affordances capture the mutual relationship between {{the environment and the}} perceiver. For example, a tall wall is a barrier to an elderly person but affords jumping-over to someone trained in parkour, or urban climbing. Like the ecological approach, the action-specific perception account favors the notion that perception involves processes that relate the environment to the perceiver's potential for action. Consequently, similar <b>environments</b> <b>will</b> look different, depending on the abilities of each perceiver. Since abilities change over time, an individual's perception of similar <b>environments</b> <b>will</b> also change as their abilities change.|$|R
