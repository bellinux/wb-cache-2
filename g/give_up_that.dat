5|$|The Huskies {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E

500|$|Vance v. Terrazas, [...] was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that established that a United States citizen cannot have {{his or her}} citizenship taken away unless {{he or she has}} acted with an intent to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> citizenship. [...] The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship. [...] However, the Court ruled that a person's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of preponderance of evidence (i.e., more likely than not) — rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Alternative Press ran {{a special}} {{in celebration of}} the album's fifteenth anniversary, which {{contains}} reflections from members of bands influenced by the album, including The Maine, The Story So Far, Mayday Parade, and Yellowcard, among others. [...] "When I heard how massive and epic Enema was for the first time, my mind was blown. It definitely {{made me want to}} be a better songwriter and make bigger-sounding records," [...] said Ryan Key of Yellowcard. In the article, the magazine credits the album with [...] "single-handedly changed the face of mainstream rock." [...] Property of Zack also gave the album a fifteenth anniversary feature, commenting, [...] "Enema of the State has become the single most important album in our overarching community since its release in 1999. It is more important, to this current generation and the one preceding it, than Dookie, or Smash, {{or whatever you want to}} put on that pedestal — and it will likely never <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> spot at the top of the standings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pottinger {{accepted}} Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston's {{offer of}} the post of envoy and plenipotentiary in China and superintendent of British trade, thus replacing Charles Elliot. In 1841, when Pottinger was sent to China, Palmerston instructed him to [...] "examine with care the natural capacities of Hong Kong, and you will not agree to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> Island unless you should find that you can exchange it for another in the neighbourhood of Canton, better adapted for the purposes in view; equally defensible; and affording sufficient shelter for Ships of War and Commerce". On 4 November 1841, Palmerston's successor Lord Aberdeen wrote to Pottinger that he had doubts over Hong Kong's acquisition since it would incur administrative expenses, and complicate relations with China and other nations.|$|E

2500|$|According to David Miller, Martin Luther viewed Mammon (or {{the desire}} for wealth) as [...] "the most common idol on earth". [...] Miller cites Jesus' {{encounter}} with the rich ruler [...] {{as an example of}} wealth being an obstacle to faith. [...] According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> wealth in order to follow Jesus. [...] Miller cites Paul's observation in 1st Timothy that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." [...] [...] Paul continues on with the observation that [...] "the love of money is the root of all evil." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, amid {{reports that}} Pitt and Aniston's divorce {{was due to}} Aniston's refusal to have {{children}} with Pitt, Aniston stated to Vanity Fair, [...] "I've {{never in my life}} said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will... I would never <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> experience for a career." [...] Aniston also revealed that her divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, Nancy, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a television show and later wrote a book entitled, From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999). Aniston has also stated she was devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whose work helped make her separation from Pitt easier. Aniston said her relationship with Pitt, which she does not regret, was [...] "seven very intense years together" [...] and that [...] "it was a beautiful, complicated relationship".|$|E
2500|$|Gerrick D. Kennedy {{from the}} Los Angeles Times {{wrote that the}} {{documentary}} [...] "remains a victory for her fans. Casual viewers will most likely glean {{the same sense of}} the superstar's life as one might from a magazine feature. But for serious fans of the fiercely private superstar, this remains a window into her life." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney said, [...] "this is less a documentary portrait than a micromanaged video diary exploring the R superstar's relationship with her laptop. The HBO film will be candy to her fan base; just don't expect startling insights into the woman behind the talent." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote that Life Is But a Dream [...] "is a carefully filtered snapshot of an artist who has enough power to become maker of her own myth." [...] Writing for Zap2it, Geoff Berkshire called it a [...] "vanity project and calculated act of image control. The only thing revealed by the film -- co-directed, co-written and co-executive produced by Beyoncé herself -- is a narcissistic inability to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>that</b> desire for control." [...] Television critic Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times gave a negative review for the film, writing, [...] " [...] is as contrived as , but probably for good reason it is neither daring nor entirely truthful. It's an infomercial, not just about Beyoncé's talent onstage but her authenticity behind the scenes. She is a people-pleasing diva and she wants to keep it that way." ...|$|E
