40|$|The AlkBGTL {{proteins}} coded on the alk operon from Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 can selectively ω-oxidize {{ethyl esters}} of C 6 to C 10 fatty acids in whole-cell conversions with Escherichia coli. The major product in these conversions is the ω-alcohol. However, AlkB {{also has the}} capacity to overoxidize the substrate to the ω-aldehyde and ω-acid. In this study, we show that alcohol dehydrogenase AlkJ and aldehyde dehydrogenase AlkH are able to oxidize ω-alcohols and ω-aldehydes of esterified fatty acids respectively. Resting E. coli expressing AlkBGTHJL enabled exclusive mono-ethyl azelate production from <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate,</b> with an initial specific activity of 61 U gcdw - 1. Within 2 h, this strain produced 3. 53 mM mono-ethyl azelate, with a yield of 0. 68 mol mol- 1. This strain also produced mono-ethyl dicarboxylic acids from ethyl esters of C 6 to C 10 fatty acids and mono-methyl azelate from methyl nonanoate. Adding <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate</b> dissolved in carrier solvent bis-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate enabled an increase in product titres to 15. 55 mM in two-liquid phase conversions.

The relationship between the concentration of rotundone and alcoholic strength during fermentation process was also investigated. Wine alcoholic strength and skin–wine contact time were two factors affecting rotundone extraction rate from grapes into wine.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Raspberries {{have been}} popular {{since the time}} of the ancient Greeks. Red {{raspberries}} are cultivated throughout the world, particularly in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) causes significant reduction in yield and crumbly fruit in raspberries, blackberries and raspberry-blackberry hybrids. There is no effective treatment once a plant is infected and the only effective prevention is using resistant varieties. Resistance is difficult to attain using traditional cultivation techniques. Through transgenic modification, five lines of resistant red raspberries have been developed from the 'Meeker' cultivar. To investigate trueness to type, flavor characteristics for raspberries grown in Oregon and Washington during 2004 and 2005 were compared. Aroma volatiles important to the raspberry aroma profile were quantified, as well as the sugar and organic acid profiles, to compare the five transgenic 'Meeker' lines with the wild type 'Meeker', 'Chilliwack', 'Tulameen', 'Willamette' and 'Yellow Meeker'. Thirty aroma compounds ((Z) - 3 -hexenol, 4 -isopropylbenzyl alcohol, 6 - methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -ol, 2 -nonanol, hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, <b>ethyl</b> hexanoate, methyl <b>nonanoate,</b> 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, raspberry ketone, zingerone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, para-cymene, geraniol, α-ionone, β-ionone, limonene, linalool, myrcene, nerol, α-phellandrene, α-pinene, sabinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpineol, terpinen- 4 -ol and terpinolene) were selected and quantified using stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) paired with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in all raspberry samples. The chiral stereoisomers of some volatile compounds in these raspberries were also studied using a cyclosilB GC column. Different raspberry cultivars varied widely in titratable acidity, sugar and acid concentration, and volatile composition, particularly α-ionone, linalool and (Z) - 3 -hexenol. Chiral compositions were also quite different among the cultivars studied. For the wild type 'Meeker' and RBDV-resistant varieties, flavor variations were observed from sites to sites and year to year. However, overall volatile profile had much less variations compared with sugar and organic acid profiles. None of the analyses separated the transgenic 'Meeker' raspberries from the wild type 'Meeker', and result was consistent for both of the locations and years studied.

Dichloromethane {{was used as}} an extraction solvent, with good repeatability and reproducibility (RSD < 10 %). The correlation coefficients (R 2) ranged from 0. 9951 to 0. 9992, showing linear calibration curves of the used reference compounds (2 -phenyl ethanol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate,</b> butyrolactone and tyrosol). The developed method was applied for characterization of the volatile components making the aroma profile of the Kékfrankos red wines produced from the grape variety grown in the Villány wine region in Hungary. Compounds determined in the wines belonged to the group of alcohols, esters, lactones, fatty acids, furans and nitrogen compounds, the first two groups being the dominant ones influencing the main aroma of the wine. Overall, Kékfrankos wines presented higher content of alcohols compared to other wines, such as Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Changli County (China) and Tempranillo wines, but lower amount compared to Albarello and Brancellao wines as well as, from the varieties Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana.

40|$|In chapter 1, we give an {{introduction}} to bifunctional monomers that {{play an important role}} in the chemical industry. Briefly, the conventional production processes of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids and α,ω-diols are discussed. Strategies for more sustainable alternatives for production of medium-chain bifunctional monomers are discussed. Monooxygenase-based processes seem promising, if the problem of poor diterminal oxidation capacities of monooxygenases is solved. Esterification could be a tool to solve this problem. In chapter 2 we have investigated the ω-oxidation activities of E. coli expressing AlkBGT or AlkBGTL, with various esters having an alkyl chain > 1. These strains were able to ω-oxidize ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of C 6 -C 10 fatty acids. Using esters with a longer alkyl chain enhanced ω-oxidation activities for C 6 and C 7 fatty acids. The major products were ω-hydroxy fatty acid esters, but over oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid also occurred. AlkL improved whole-cell ω-oxidation activities for substrates with a logPo/w above 4. Since the major products were ω-hydroxy fatty acid esters in chapter 2, we investigated further conversion of these compounds to mono-esterified dicarboxylic acids in chapter 3. Alcohol dehydrogenase AlkJ and aldehyde dehydrogenase AlkH were functionally expressed in E. coli. AlkJ is functional with 9 -hydroxy <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate</b> as substrate, AlkH is functional with 9 -oxo methyl nonanoate. Expansion of the AlkBGTL system with AlkJ and AlkH yielded strain E. coli AlkBGTHJL. This strain accumulated mono-ethyl azelate exclusively from <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate.</b> Adding the substrate dissolved in a carrier solvent increased final product titers. Subsequently, we investigated if in vivo esterification could enhance the ω-oxidation of AlkB in chapter 4. E. coli expressing AlkBGTHJL can ω-oxidize octanoate and nonanoate, but not efficiently. When acyl-CoA ligase AlkK and acyltransferase AtfA or Eeb 1 were also expressed, ω-oxidation was more efficient. Furthermore, complete oxidation to the carboxylic acid was much more efficient when also in vivo esterification was achieved. Also di-ethyl esters were produced, meaning that esterification occurred twice. Since ω-oxidation of fatty acids was improved with in vivo esterification in chapter 4, we were interested to investigate whether this system could also work with n-alkanes in chapter 5. Mono-esters of dicarboxylic acids were produced from n-alkanes by E. coli expressing AlkBGTHJKL and either AtfA or Eeb 1. Starting from n-alkanes would also allow production of alcohols if overoxidation could be prevented. Application of a different alcohol acyltransferase (Atf 1), limited the overoxidation by AlkB. ω-Oxidation of the formed ester resulted in the production of ω-alcohols, which were again esterified by Atf 1. Chapter 6 is the general discussion of this thesis, which evaluates the combination of esterification and terminal oxidation. Suggestions for improvements of the biocatalytic pathway are provided and critical factors for experiments in bioreactors are identified...|$|E
30|$|Apart from ethyl esters, {{considerable}} methyl esters {{were observed}} in this study (Fig.  2), likely {{to be due to}} the inductive agent (methanol) of the expression system, where the yeast had priority in utilizing methanol in place of ethanol if sufficient methanol was present. In particular, either of the recombinant strain resulted in significantly higher levels of methyl decanoate. Indeed, methyl and ethyl decanoate accounts for 50.4 and 54.2  % of the total volatile aroma esters generated by P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1, respectively, indicating a high-availability of decanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, the two recombinant yeasts both produced methyl nonanoate but not <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate,</b> further indicating the significance of substrate availability. More interestingly, methyl laurate was observed in both strains whereas ethyl laurate was only obtained in P. pastoris-EHT 1. Given the presence of ethyl laurate is relatively low level, it is proposed that the difference between P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1 was little. Furthermore, the formation of methyl esters also provides an explanation for the absence of high level ethyl esters in the volatile products. In future research {{it would be interesting to}} compare affinity of both recombinant enzymes for methanol and ethanol using biochemical in vitro tests, which could provide insights on the production of either ethyl or methyl esters.|$|E

Coexpression of AlkBGT and AlkL resulted in 1. 7 -fold-higher ω-oxidation activity on NAEE. With this strain, initial activity on NAEE was 70 U/g (dry weight) of cells (g cdw), 67 % {{of the initial}} activity on methyl nonanoate. In time-lapse conversions with 5 mMNAEE the main product was 9 -hydroxy NAEE (3. 6 mM), but also 9 -oxo NAEE (0. 1 mM) and 9 -carboxy NAEE (0. 6 mM) were formed. AlkBGT also ω-oxidized ethyl, propyl, and butyl esters of fatty acids ranging from C 6 to C 10.

From these esters, application of butyl hexanoate resulted in the highest ω-oxidation activity, 82 U/g cdw. Coexpression of AlkL only had a positive effect on ω-functionalization of substrates with a total length of C 11 or longer.

The analytical method is simple, selective, and appropriated for {{the determination of}} esters in distilled spirits. The limit of detection ranged from 29 (ethyl hexanoate) to 530 (ethyl acetate) mu g L- 1, whereas the standard deviation for repeatability was between 0. 774 % (ethyl hexanoate) and 5. 05 % (isoamyl octanoate). Relative standard deviation values for accuracy vary from 90. 3 to 98. 5 % for ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate, respectively. Ethyl acetate was shown to be the major ester in cachaca (median content of 22. 6 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol), followed by ethyl lactate (median content of 8. 32 mg 100 mL(- 1) anhydrous alcohol). Cachaca produced in copper and hybrid alembic present a higher content of ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate than those produced in a stainless-steel column, whereas cachaca produced by distillation in a stainless-steel column present a higher content of ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl laurate.

However, there was no considerable difference between original cellulose-containing and carboxylated-cellulose containing systems in the release of most compounds, except for relatively long-chain esters such as ethyl caprylate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate.</b> The release from the original and carboxylated cellulose solutions controlled to pH 10 {{was significantly higher than}} that from solutions adjusted to pH 4 and 7 in the case of some esters (ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, butyl propionate, ethyl caproate) and alcohols (2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol), in particular, ethyl butyrate and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol. In contrast, the release of 2, 3 -butanedione from both the original and carboxylated cellulose solutions was increased at pH 4 and 7 compared to that at pH 10 by about 70 % and 130 %, respectively.

The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>nonanoate,</b> ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E
