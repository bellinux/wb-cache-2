After cooling in a desiccator, the samples were reweighed (using an electronic balance Gibertini no. 125186, made in Milan, Italy).

During both <b>isothermal</b> <b>oven</b> curing and ultrasonic curing of this system, an induction period was observed. For the rapid progression of polymerization reaction in ultrasonic curing, a preheating temperature of 100 C {{was found to be}} sufficient. However, degree of curing due to the nonthermal effect of ultrasonic curing was found to be maximal at a preheating temperature of 80 C. It was noticed that the ultrasonic curing reduced the time of curing by a factor of four, and the curing level from pure thermal effects could be determined by incorporating the curing temperature history into the autocatalytic chemical model. The degree of curing from the experimental results of isothermal heating in DSC and the one predicted by the autocatalytic chemical model exhibited a good agreement...|$|E

40|$|Eight solid {{stationary}} phases {{were examined}} for their suitability for pyroly sis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) of micro-organisms. With temperature programming these phases offered little {{advantage over the}} traditional liquid phase Carbowax 20 M, but at an isothermal analysis temperature of 100 "C their use solved many technical problems. Pyrograms were produced containing small numbers of baseline-resolved peaks which eluted within 8 to 25 min. Four to six specimens per hour could be examined with two pyrolysers attached to one chromatograph oven. When a control organism was used to derive normalized results, pyrograms were reproducible with a second column and a second pyrolyser, suggesting that inter-laboratory reproducibility may be possible. Five different bacterial genera were well discriminated and some differentiation was achieved between different isolates of Streptococcus mutans, but similarity between pyrograms was unrelated to orthodox taxonomic grouping. The best discrimination was achieved with Chromosorb 104, followed by Chromosorb 101 and Tenax-GC. With solid phases and <b>isothermal</b> <b>oven</b> temperatures Py-GC is a promising technique for microbial identification...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{operations}} in food industries where grains are handled, thus producing combustible dusts, are grinding, drying, transport in bucket elevators and conveyors, pneumatic transport, filtering, and storage in silos. Unfortunately, these operations {{all too often}} give rise to fires or explosions with catastrophic consequences. Spontaneous combustion must {{be considered to be}} a potential ignition source for a dust or gas explosion every time a large mass of combustible dust comes in contact with air. In this paper we present a methodological approach to the characterization of combustible products (grains, pellets, dusts, etc) with respect to self-heating and fermentation and give results for certain agricultural dusts. Our method includes the use of modeling and various laboratory tests such as Thermal Differential Analysis coupled with Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (DTA-TGA), <b>Isothermal</b> <b>Oven</b> Tests (at ambient pressure and elevated pressure), and Adiabatic Calorimetry. The objective of these tests is not only to rank the various products by order of reactivity but to determine under which conditions a given product will pose a threat of spontaneous combustion...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis inter- as well as {{self-diffusion}} coefficients have been determined by experimental series of measurements on a ternary Al-Cu-Ag system at the eutectic {{as well as on the}} binary constituent systems. Through the design of a state of the art ex-situ long-capillary facility and combined with the application of new and complementary methods of measurement with strong enhanced precision this investigation offers a methodical approach to these systems and identifies reproducible and accurate diffusion coefficients. This was achieved by the utilization and development of different methods for the sample preparation and the chemical post-mortem sample analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry. In the course of this study ex-situ series of measurements have been conducted on a binary AlCu sub-system. The determined results were compared with literature data. These diffusion measurement were compared to those collected by the use of long-capillary X-ray radiography or shear cell measurement in an <b>isothermal</b> <b>oven.</b> It is shown that even with a high number of similar experiments, neither the statistical mean nor the diffusion coefficient with the lowest value allows a conclusion to be made regarding to the actual diffusion coefficient. A significant result of the discussion of the different diffusion techniques in this thesis is that diffusion experiments require an in-situ process control. Moreover, Neutron radiography should be applied for liquid alloys which do not show sufficient contrast between the sample pairs for radiography methods or, in the case of multi-component systems, which are not respectively only conditionally suitable for this purpose. In the binary AlAg system seven different sample pairs were tested within a concentration level of 0 - 45 at % silver. By using radiography long-capillary experiments, in-situ interdiffusion coefficients within the entire concentration level were identified. Additionally the self-diffusion coefficient of pure silver as well as the self-diffusion coefficient of a mean silver concentration of 20. 4 at % was determined at the Time of Flight spectrometer (TOFTOF) at FRM II in Munich. Thus, the validity of the Darken equation for this concentration within the measurement error was confirmed. A relationship between the atomic dynamic and the packing density with the detected interdiffusion coefficient could have been established through the calculation of the thermodynamic factor and the packaging density, within the considered concentration level. A detailed error analysis proves the influence of free surfaces, temperature variation and diffusion blocking on the interdiffusion coefficient, which enforces together with the previous mentioned AlCu measurement the necessity of an in-situ process control. In the course of this study the measured diffusion coefficient of ternary Al-Cu-Ag alloys with the composition surrounding the eutectic are presented. Furthermore, the different measurement methods, which led to the submitted results, are discussed and their application under different conditions compared, additionally, a selection of a qualified evaluation process for the diffusion profile is discussed. More specifically, a series of experiments with the support of the classic ex-situ long-capillary, the shear cell method, the long-capillary at the neutron source of the FRM II in Munich and ex-situ long-capillary experiments on the research rocket Mapheus were conducted. One substantial finding does confirm the achieved results in the binary system: without an in-situ process control it is not possible to reach a conclusion with regard to the diffusion coefficient with an accuracy better than 50 %. Also, by increasing the number of experiments, there are no improvements in the experimental error range shown within this system, which would satisfactory value of the diffusion coefficient. Only after having applied other more recent techniques, is the quality and error level of the determined ex-situ results able to be assessed. In general, for complex ternary systems the quasi-binary diffusion analysis of with alloys with a constant concentration of a certain component cannot be implemented as an a priori application. In those systems, the mass diffusion of a component can be influenced by the chemical concentration gradient of a considered alloy component through interaction with other alloy elements of the system. In order to capture this behaviour, a diffusion matrix was developed within {{the scope of}} this study, which allows the entire description of the measured data. For the first time the ternary Al-Cu-Ag system was investigated systematically and with different diffusion measurement methods. The universal validity of the results are to be verified beyond this study considering other multi-component systems with different thermodynamic driving forces...|$|E
30|$|To {{achieve these}} aims, {{the current study}} was {{conducted}} in two parts. The first, comprised a short term accelerated non-isothermal stability experiment (1  week in a LNISO oven by linear heating) on two compendial drugs and 18 discovery compounds with different pharmacophores. The second, was a long-term conventional Arrhenius stability experiment (8  weeks in five separate <b>isothermal</b> <b>ovens),</b> conducted in parallel on the same 18 discovery compounds. A subset of the conventional stability data (time 0 to week 4) was selected for evaluation as an abbreviated isothermal method that could be an alternative method for accelerated stability. Stability data from LNISO experiments were compared to those from the conventional isothermal and the abbreviated isothermal experiments. For the compendial compounds (acetaminophen and sulfacetamide), the non-isothermal data were compared to the isothermal stability data for these drugs reported in the literature (Koshy and Lach 1961; Meakin et al. 1971).|$|R
40|$|The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} safe operating conditions for using recycled (used) lubricating oil from mining equipment as a partial replacement for diesel fuel to make ANFO-type blasting agents. The use of recycled oil (RO) conserves energy, reduces oil imports, and reduces mining costs. Since RO has a variable composition, there was concern that the additives/impurities it contains may cause ANFO made with RO to be unstable (as compared to regular ANFO) at high summer ambient storage temperatures. Reactivity of RO with zinc was also a concern. Thermal stability tests were conducted to help quantify and resolve these issues. ANFO mixtures (0. 66 lb/ 300 g) were put into sample containers made of steel, stainless steel, and galvanized (zinc coated) steel pipe fittings, which were heated in <b>isothermal</b> <b>ovens.</b> The experimental parameters were temperature settings of 14020 F (6020 C) and 17620 F (8020 C), four sample container (pipe fitting) metal combinations, and nominal heating periods of one and three days.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and validate mathematical models to characterize the thermal performance of a radiative shielded furnace, the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) <b>Isothermal</b> Diffusion <b>Oven.</b> The mathematical models are validated against experimental data obtained from testing the breadboard oven in a terrestrial laboratory environment. It is anticipated that the validation will produce math models capable of predicting the thermal performance of the furnace over a wide range of operating conditions, including those for which no experimental data is available. Of particular interest is the furnace core temperature versus heater power parametric and the transient thermal response of the furnace. Application to a microgravity environment is not considered, although it is conjectured that the removal of any gravity dependent terms from the math models developed for the terrestrial application should yield adequate results in a microgravity environment. The UAH <b>Isothermal</b> Diffusion <b>Oven</b> is designed to provide a thermal environment that is conducive to measuring the diffusion of high temperature liquid metals. In addition to achieving the temperatures required to melt a sample placed within the furnace, reducing or eliminating convective motions within the melt is an important design consideration [1]. Both of these influences are reflected {{in the design of the}} furnace. Reducing unwanted heat losses from the furnace is achieved through the use of low conductivity materials and reflective shielding. As evidenced by the highly conductive copper core used to house the sample within the furnace, convective motions can be greatly suppressed by providing an essentially uniform thermal environment. An oven of this design could ultimately be utilized in a microgravity environment, presumably as a experiment payload. Such an application precipitates other design requirements that limit the resources available to the furnace such as power, mass, volume, and possibly even time. Through the experimental and numerical results obtained, the power requirements and thermal response time of the breadboard furnace are quantified...|$|R
40|$|In the {{extrusion}} {{blow molding}} process the shape and thickness distribution of the finished container depend on {{the dimensions of the}} parison at the time of inflation. In particular, the processes of swell and sag act to cause a variation of parison dimensions between the time the melt emerges from the die and the moment of inflation. In the present study the effects of die geometry, extrusion velocity and the rheological properties of the resin on parison behavior were studied. Four annular dies (a straight, a diverging and two converging dies) and three high density polyethylene resins were used. To study the individual contributions of swell and sag to the overall parison behavior, two types of experiments were carried out. First, swell was studied in the absence of sag by extruding the parison into an isothermal oil bath. Both diameter and thickness swells were measured as functions of time. Then combined effect of swell and sag was studied by extruding the parison into an <b>isothermal</b> air <b>oven.</b> A simple lumped parameter model was developed to predict the length of the parison using the swell data, storage modulus and process variables...|$|R
