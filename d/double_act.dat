5|$|Julie Walters was a {{long term}} {{collaborator}} of Wood's, although unlike Wood and Walters, their previous television series together, only Wood's name remained in the title.

She played many two handers with Wood {{as well as other}} roles such as Margery the daytime television host, a mad shoe shop lady, the elderly waitress in the Two Soups sketch, and a transsexual hairdresser. Most famously, she was the char-lady Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques. She later revealed that alongside her starring role in Educating Rita, it's the part she's still recognised the most by the public for.|$|E

25|$|Bailey began {{touring the}} country with comedians such as Mark Lamarr. In 1984 he formed a <b>double</b> <b>act,</b> the Rubber Bishops, with Toby Longworth (a fellow former pupil at King Edward's, Bath). It was there that Bailey began {{developing}} his own style, mixing in musical parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many amoebas {{does it take to}} change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 and was replaced by Martin Stubbs.|$|E
50|$|Konik horses with {{a single}} whorl located above their eyes were rated as more {{difficult}} to handle whereas horses that also had a single whorl but located below or right in between their eyes were easier to handle.

During the [...] "Live and in Pieces" [...] tour, relations deteriorated further and the Wembley show was widely and accurately predicted to be their last appearance together.|$|R
