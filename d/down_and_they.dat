5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy {{intended}} {{to lay down}} the first vessel in July 1914, but the outbreak of World War I that month caused the Navy to postpone construction until September. Ultimately, none of the vessels were laid <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were formally cancelled in late 1917. However, four of the 35 cm guns had been built and were transferred to the Austro-Hungarian Army for use on the Italian Front.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|Sands {{tended to}} {{soldiers}} who had been injured in France during World War I, having established a hospital for soldiers near Dieppe with Hudson. It was forced to close <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> continued their nursing efforts in both France and England. Sands was then in Britain working as a forewoman in a factory that made overalls. In 1916 she became a British citizenship. During World War II, Sands served as a nurse. The house in Chelsea, London was destroyed during The Blitz by a parachute mine, and the house in France was broken into and its contents were stolen or destroyed. The two war-time events resulted {{in the loss of}} most of Sands and Hudson's works.|$|E

5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely {{would have resulted in}} a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E

25|$|Highbury {{was also}} home to Highbury Studios a film/TV/recording studio further along the same street, at 65A Highbury New Park; these studios had a {{training}} school next door in a disused church hall. Built initially as a music conservatoire in 1890, the site became a recording studio in 1926 for the Piccadilly label. In 1933, they became the Highbury (film) Studios and in 1945 they were acquired by the Rank Organisation. Due to economic difficulties, Rank closed the studios <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were demolished in 1960. Athenaeum Court, a block of flats, now occupies the site.|$|E
25|$|Born in North Crosby, Ontario, on November 1, 1861, Puffer {{was the son}} of a United Empire Loyalist. He married Charlotte Ann Gilmore, {{with whom}} he would have seven children, on July 1, 1885. They came west in 1889 and homesteaded near Olds, before finally {{settling}} in Lacombe in 1893. Puffer was engaged in several businesses, dealing in cattle, lumber, dairy products, and farm implements. In 1900, he established a butchery in Lacombe next to a laundry operated by Hop Chung, a Chinese immigrant. When Chung wished to bring his wife and children over from China but could not afford the C$500 head tax, Puffer paid it; Chung's family arrived in Lacombe in 1908, making his wife one of the first Chinese women in Alberta. In 1911 both Puffer's butchery and Chung's laundry burnt <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> rebuilt a single building to share.|$|E

25|$|During {{this first}} phase, aerial {{reinforcements}} were dispatched to Luftwaffenkommando Ost (Air Command East's) Luftflotte 1 (Air Fleet 1). The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) sent several Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) to assist German defences against intense Soviet air attacks. Elements of JG 54 and JG 77 were rushed to provide air superiority operations over the battle front. Despite being {{opposed by the}} Soviet 14th Air Army and outnumbered two to one, the Luftwaffe maintained air superiority. Luftflotte 1 destroyed 42 Soviet aircraft in large-scale air battles on the 1 and 2 September and relieved pressure on German ground forces. The German aerial activity was so effective, there was evidence some Soviet airmen's morale had broken <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were not giving their best in combat. This prompted Joseph Stalin to threaten any pilot refusing to engage with the enemy a court-martial.|$|E
25|$|Trinity got {{the ball}} to start the game and used four plays, {{culminating}} in a 25-yard run by Chris Baer, to score a touchdown. Millsaps was unable to get a first <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> punted back to Trinity. On the punt, Trinity's Caleb Urban fumbled the ball and Eric McCarty of the Majors recovered at the Trinity 40-yard line. The Tigers defense prevented the Majors from reaching the end zone so the Majors attempted a field goal, which was no good. The Tigers punted on their next possession and then Majors quarterback Juan Joseph's pass was intercepted by Lee Patterson at the Trinity 4-yard line. The Tigers also ended their drive when Blake Barmore's pass was intercepted by Ray Kline. Millsaps took over at the Trinity 20-yard line and fourplays later scored a touchdown on a 12-yard pass from Joseph to Louis Conley. A punt by each team left Trinity with the ball and the score was tied at 7 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|On {{their opening}} {{possession}} {{in the second}} half, the Bengals {{managed to get a}} sustained drive going, moving the ball 61 yards in 12 plays and taking 9:15 off the clock. Esiason, who completed only 4 of 12 passes for 48 yards in the first half, completed 3 of 4 passes for 54 yards on the drive, including a 20-yard completion to James Brooks and 23-yard and 11-yard completions to Cris Collinsworth, setting up a 43-yard field goal from Breech to give the Bengals their first lead of the game, 6–3. Cincinnati then forced San Francisco to punt, but on the first play of their next drive, 49ers rookie linebacker Bill Romanowski intercepted a pass from Esiason at the Bengals 23-yard line. However, after a dropped pass by Rice, the 49ers' offense could not get a first <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> had to settle for Cofer's 32-yard field goal to tie the game, 6-6.|$|E
