25|$|Klein {{was born}} in Ratno, Ukraine, but in 1910 (at age one) he immigrated {{with his family to}} Montreal, Quebec, the city in which he would live most of his life. Ratno had seen a series of pogroms and, like many Ukrainian Jews, Klein's parents sought a safer life elsewhere. As a result of the influx of Jewish {{immigrants}} to Montreal, its Jewish community flourished, even though many families lived close to the poverty line. The family of Irving Layton was another notable addition to this community. Klein's father, an Orthodox follower of the Jewish faith, influenced Klein's early development. The son's early education and literary interests owed much to his plan to become a rabbi when he <b>grew</b> <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> plan that he never fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Eidsberg Station {{grew up as}} a {{community}} hub and featured at various times a store, post office, telegraph, café, bakery and fuel station. However, there never <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> village around station like many other of the stations in the area. The post office opened in 1885, {{and a year later}} a warehouse for Felleskjøpet was erected next to the station. A road was built from the station to Huseby in 1910. Eidsberg and Mysen were split into two municipalities in 1920. Unlike around Mysen Station, Eidsberg Station had never developed into a town. Some people called for the new municipal hall to be built next to the station so a new village could be built around them. This was not done and instead it was placed at Søndre Mysen. Despite efforts, only nine lots were sold around Eidsberg Station the following one and a half decade.|$|E
25|$|May 28, 2013 – In {{his last}} regular season game ever at Citi Field, Mariano Rivera gets honored by Mets owner Jeff Wilpon and throws {{out the first}} pitch of the game to former Met closer John Franco. Young Mets phenom Matt Harvey, who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> Yankee fan, had an {{impressive}} line – 8IP 6H 1ER 0BB 10K – but left with a 1-0 deficit. Rivera would come into {{the game in the}} bottom of the 9th and promptly give up a double to Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. David Wright would get another hit to drive in Murphy and contribute to Rivera's first blown save of the year. The next batter Lucas Duda would get the game-winning hit off Rivera to gave him the first blown save of his career where he did not record at least one out. The Mets swept the season series for the first time in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Korolev {{grew up in}} Nezhin, {{under the}} care of his {{maternal}} grandparents Mykola Yakovych Moskalenko who was a trader of the Second Guild and Maria Matviivna Moskalenko (Fursa), a daughter of a local cossack. Korolev's mother also had a sister Anna and two brothers Yuri and Vasily. Maria Koroleva was frequently away attending Women's higher education courses in Kiev. As a child, Korolev was stubborn, persistent, and argumentative. Sergei <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> lonely child with few friends. Korolev began reading at an early age, and his abilities in mathematics and other subjects made him a favorite student of his teachers, but caused jealousy from his peers. He later stated in an interview, the torment of classmates bullying and teasing him as a small child encouraged his focus on academic work. His mother divorced Pavel in 1915 and in 1916 married Grigory Mikhailovich Balanin, an electrical engineer educated in Germany but attending the Kiev Polytechnic University because German engineering diplomas were unrecognized in Russia. After getting a job with the regional railway, Grigory moved the family to Odessa in 1917, where they endured hardships with many other families through the tumultuous years following the Russian Revolution and continuing internecine struggles until the Bolsheviks assumed unchallenged power in 1920. Local schools were closed and young Korolev had to continue his studies at home. Grigory proved a good influence on his step-son, who suffered from a bout of typhus during the severe food shortages of 1919.|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little too soon."

40|$|Abstract — The {{ideas of}} {{systemic}} intelligence provide {{a set of}} methodologies and paradigms that are, beside other advantages, suitable for constructing control systems {{that are capable of}} <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> In particular the promising methods of Systemic Architecture, Schedule of Structural Development, Memory Organization and Rules for Learning and Adaptation are presented and discussed with respect to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> artifact. Of special interest is the concept of growth in the sense of <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> from <b>a</b> kind of infantile stage to a fully matured entity. To <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> artifact from an infantile stage via a sequence of learned abilities to a fully matured entity is still a feature of life not yet sufficiently transposed onto technical systems. To enable the capability to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> artifacts, <b>a</b> set of methodologies and principles is presented in this paper. The developed methodologies are already implemented into physically existing test beds that operate, adapt (and <b>grow</b> <b>up)</b> in real time and in the real world to prove that the proposed approach is feasible under real conditions. Two realizations (robot control, audio signal processing) of a systemic architecture for an up-growing system are presented in this paper. I...|$|R
