5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, on an individual level the season was to <b>get</b> <b>even</b> worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, putting him out of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, putting him out of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc <b>get</b> <b>even</b> with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|Space Invaders {{has been}} remade on {{numerous}} platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated {{versions of the}} original arcade game.

25|$|In 1978, the court's Marquette Bank decision, {{which held}} {{that under the}} National Banking Act of 1863 states could not enforce their anti-usury laws against nationally-chartered banks based in other states, {{opened the door to}} {{increased}} credit card spending by Americans.
