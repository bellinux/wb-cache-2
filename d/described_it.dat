5|$|In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an {{efficient}} method for computing the {{greatest common divisor}} (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

5|$|Maier {{writes that}} {{the names of the}} main {{characters}} imply Student Hidjo should be read allegorically, with the names Hidjo (green), Woengoe (violet), and Biroe (blue) showing an interconnection between the characters. Kartodikromo <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as an extended simile.|$|E

5|$|P. c. sanfordi {{is found}} in Newfoundland. Harry C. Oberholser <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1914 from a {{specimen}} collected by a Dr. Sanford, whom he named it after.

5|$|Reviewers {{have had}} {{difficulty}} reading Night as an eyewitness account. It has been categorized as a novel, autobiography, autobiographical novel, non-fictional novel, semi-fictional memoir, fictional-autobiographical novel, fictionalized autobiographical memoir and memoir-novel.

25|$|Descriptions of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé vary. Some legends <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> {{as having}} an elephant-like body with a long neck and tail and a small head, a {{description}} which has been suggested to be similar in appearance {{to that of the}} extinct Sauropoda, while others <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> as more closely resembling elephants, rhinoceros, and other known animals. <b>It</b> is usually <b>described</b> as being gray-brown in color. Some traditions, such as those of Boha Village, <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> as a spirit rather than a flesh and blood creature.|$|R

5|$|The Monk {{wrote of}} the event in the Histoire de Charles VI (History of Charles VI), {{covering}} about 25 years of the King's reign. He seemed to disapprove {{on the grounds that}} the event broke social mores and the King's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as a celebratory event.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi war {{economy was}} a mixed economy that {{combined}} {{a free market}} with central planning. Historian Richard Overy <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as being somewhere in between the command economy of the Soviet Union and the capitalist system of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The folio, which {{collected}} {{together the}} engravings from the paintings, {{has been the}} most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise: it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as a precursor to the modern coffee table book.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that <b>described</b> <b>it.</b> Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the number}} of individuals, Waptia fieldensis is the third most {{abundant}} arthropod from the Burgess Shale Formation, with thousands of specimens collected. It was among the first fossils found by the American paleontologist Charles D. Walcott in 1909. He <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1912 and named it after two mountains near the discovery site – Mount Wapta and Mount Field.|$|E
5|$|Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as a smear campaign.|$|E
5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she <b>described</b> <b>it,</b> “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird.|$|E

5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as utterly ruined at that time, but still {{conspicuous}} by the ramshackle monastery {{buildings on the}} site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, {{and out of the}} control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E
5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are <b>described.</b> <b>It</b> was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|English {{physician}} John Langdon Down {{first described}} Down syndrome in 1862, recognizing it {{as a distinct}} type of mental disability, and again in a more widely published report in 1866. Édouard Séguin <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as separate from cretinism in 1944. By the 20th century, Down syndrome had become the most recognizable form of mental disability.|$|E
