For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear <b>hatch</b> <b>door</b> was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a hatchway in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a <b>hatch</b> <b>door</b> on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with diagonal bracing. The dome is made from eight steel segments bolted together with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a hardwood timber floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|E
500|$|Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) {{is being}} {{released}} from a military prison for unknown reasons. Upon leaving, he runs into Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) and Desmond {{while he was in}} prison, and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship. Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Charles Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (There is a moment in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island. He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit, Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) (who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks) who takes him to the [...] The two live together for three years before Desmond finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond's boat. Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down, Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the <b>hatch</b> <b>door,</b> and turns on a light. Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself.|$|E

2500|$|Because Deadliest Catch is {{essentially}} a filmed record of everyday life in a stressful working environment, the producers have to censor gestures and language deemed inappropriate for television audiences. For example, under the U.S. Television Ratings system, Deadliest Catch is rated TV-14 with inappropriate language ("L") as a highlighted concern. For visual disguise of such items as finger gestures, bloody injuries, or non-featured crew member anonymity, the producers use the traditional pixelization or simple blurring. However, due to {{the sheer volume of}} profanities used in the course of everyday crew member conversation, the producers occasionally employ alternate methods of censoring profanities, using sound effects such as a ship's horn, the [...] "clang" [...] of a <b>hatch</b> <b>door,</b> or a burst of radio static in place of the traditional [...] "bleep".|$|E

5000|$|Inward opening plug hatches {{were used}} during the early U.S. space program on the [...] "Block I" [...] Apollo Command Module, because this ensured a {{reliable}} seal to the pressurised module. NASA {{decided to return to}} outward opening hatches on the Command Module after the plug hatch prevented rapid egress of the crew from the Apollo 1 fire, trapping and killing the three astronauts. Plug doors were retained for the CM docking hatch and the two hatches on the Apollo Lunar Module, as a fire in the low-pressure air atmosphere was more manageable; the Apollo 1 fire occurred in a high-pressure pure oxygen atmosphere. Plug doors were also used as the outer <b>hatch</b> <b>doors</b> on the Space Shuttle.

5000|$|The Gemini capsule was an {{enlarged}} {{version of the}} Mercury, with a 7.5 ft-diameter heat shield. Propulsion, electrical power, attitude control and retrorockets were placed in an external equipment module (unknowingly, similar to the Vostok design) which adapted the capsule to the 10 ft-diameter Gemini-Titan launch vehicle. Thrusters were added for translation control as well as attitude control, and the forward thrusters allowed the spacecraft to change its orbital inclination and altitude. Batteries were replaced with hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells for long-duration power generation. The spacecraft could stay in orbit {{for up to two}} weeks. The capsule had two <b>hatch</b> <b>doors</b> that could be opened and closed in flight, allowing extra-vehicular activity (EVA, known as [...] "space-walking"). The avionics equipment inside the capsule did not require ambient air cooling, allowing the cabin to be depressurized during EVA.

50|$|The {{southern}} end accommodates the receiving and despatch docks, main room, cream platform, churn room, chill and cold rooms, salt room, packing rooms, testing rooms {{and the office}} mezzanine. Concrete platforms, approximately 700mm above {{the level of the}} main room, run along the east, south and west sides and form the receiving and despatch docks. These docks service the former railway siding to the east and vehicle loading area to the south and west. The deck of the cream platform is formed by the concrete ceilings of the chill and cold stores, salt room, packing and other rooms below. A fibrous cement sheeted partition runs part the way down the west side and stout timber posts continue around the perimeter. The posts to the west side carry large metal brackets that supported the pulleys and belts once associated with the motors for the churns which stood on the floor below. The main room now accommodates machinery and equipment for the current oil pressing business. The chill/cold stores, salt room and packing rooms retain original features including <b>hatches,</b> <b>doors</b> and doorways, concrete upstands and floor drains.|$|R
50|$|Ships are {{inspected}} on {{a regular}} basis by a team of Lloyd's Register surveyors, {{one of the most important}} inspections being a ship's Load Line survey - due once every five years.
