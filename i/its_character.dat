5|$|Egyptian deities are {{connected}} {{in a complex}} and shifting array of relationships.

5|$|The 2015 Fantastic Four {{film was}} the weakest {{reviewed}} of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, <b>its</b> <b>character</b> arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story.

5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and <b>its</b> <b>character</b> designs and noted a misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{boosted the}} {{popularity}} and {{image of the}} occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, The Originals, and The Dresden Files {{have been influenced by}} it, and many imitators of both the series and <b>its</b> <b>character</b> flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{part of the}} Millfield estate {{south of}} Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street), the street was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and was laid out around 1704. It was a fashionable address in the 18th century, but <b>its</b> <b>character</b> changed to {{commercial}} and retail use {{by the end of}} the 19th. Most of the street's original buildings have since been demolished. Great Marlborough Street has had an association with the law since the late-18th century; Marlborough Street Magistrates Court subsequently became one of the most important magistrates courts in London. The department store Liberty is on the corner of Great Marlborough Street with Regent Street and sports a Mock Tudor facade.|$|E
5|$|These {{plans were}} {{extremely}} controversial. All three envisaged {{reducing the number}} of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering <b>its</b> <b>character</b> and appearance. The Eastern Daily Press organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed {{reduction in the number of}} stalls which would mean stallholders losing their jobs and the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change to the character of central Norwich that such a radical redesign of the market would entail. A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling {{for an end to the}} state monopoly on printing presses. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. <b>Its</b> <b>character</b> was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E

5|$|Gimmick! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{and a lack}} of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of America did not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to <b>its</b> <b>character</b> design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} {{in the months}} preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including Austin, Texas, Sydney, Australia, and Calgary, Alberta. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim; critics praised <b>its</b> <b>character</b> development, {{as well as its}} storyline, effects, stunts, action sequences, direction, and its score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, ultimately winning Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by two sequels, Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016), with a fourth having been announced.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee {{to help determine}} its art direction and settings. <b>Its</b> <b>character</b> designs are influenced by Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented {{with a wide range}} of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E

5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in <b>its</b> <b>character,</b> for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world {{should not be}} overlooked as {{a key factor in}} its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost <b>its</b> <b>character</b> as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} work on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, Masahiro Sakurai {{was taken}} out for a meal by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata in July 2008. During their meal, Iwata asked Sakurai to develop a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was still in early development at the time, with Sakurai being the first external staff member to learn of its existence. On his way home, Sakurai was faced with both ideas and problems: Sora Ltd., which had developed Super Smash Bros. Brawl, had been drastically reduced in size {{as most of the}} game's staff had been either from other Nintendo teams or outsourced. While he had the option to creating an easy-to-develop port for the system, Sakurai decided to create a game around the third-person shooter genre, which was unpopular in Japan yet seemed suited to the planned 3D effects of the 3DS. At this point, the project was still an original game. In later conversations with Iwata, Sakurai decided to use an existing Nintendo IP as the game's basis. This was inspired by feedback received from players of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that many members of <b>its</b> <b>character</b> roster had not been in an original game for some time. After a positive response from Iwata at the suggestion, Sakurai ran through the possible franchises and decided to use Kid Icarus due to its long absence from the gaming market and continued popularity in the West. He also decided upon him due to his involvement with the character through Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Once he had chosen a possible series, he conceived the basic sequence of five-minute aerial segments, ground-based combat and bosses at the end of chapters. After submitting his plan, Sakurai was given the go-ahead to develop the game. One of the other franchises under consideration by Sakurai for use in the game was Star Fox, but he felt that there were some restrictions in implementing the planned gameplay features within the Star Fox setting. Uprising was the first Kid Icarus game to be developed since the Western-exclusive 1991 Game Boy title , and the first to be planned for Japan since the original Kid Icarus in 1986.|$|E
