Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, {{believes}} that Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a <b>horse</b> <b>sale</b> later in the month.

60|$|When breakfast {{was over}} he sauntered {{out into the}} market square, where the <b>horse</b> <b>sale</b> was already in progress. The yearlings were being sold first--tall, long-legged, skittish, wild-eyed creatures, who had run free upon the upland pastures, with ragged hair and towsie manes, but hardy, inured to all weathers, and with the makings of splendid hunters and steeplechasers when corn and time had brought them to maturity. They were largely of {{thoroughbred}} blood, and were being bought by English dealers, who would invest a few pounds now on what they might sell for fifty guineas in a year, if all went well. It was legitimate speculation, for the horse is a delicate creature, he is afflicted with many ailments, the least accident may destroy his value, he is a certain expense and an uncertain profit, and for one who comes safely to maturity several may bring no return at all. So the English horse-dealers took their risks as they bought up the shaggy Irish yearlings. One man with a ruddy face and a yellow overcoat took them by the dozen, with as much sang froid {{as if they had}} been oranges, entering each bargain in a bloated note-book. He bought forty or fifty during the time that Dodds was watching him.|$|E

5000|$|Fasig-Tipton's main horse {{auction in}} the early 20th century was {{referred}} to as [...] "Old Glory." [...] Held annually in late November or early December, the Old Glory sale offered a [...] "Grand Aggregation of Thoroughbred Stallions, Mares, Racehorses, Yearlings, and Weanlings," [...] as well as Standardbreds. Shortly after the Old Glory sale of 1907, New York suffered a severe economic downturn, and bank closures threatened the sustainability of the <b>horse</b> <b>sales</b> business. Fasig turned the company over to his assistant, Enoch James Tranter, who brokered a deal with the banks which allowed the young company to survive the financial instability. Tranter's also made dramatic changes to the format of the sales catalogue: originally, the page for each horse offered might list up to 30 generations of pedigree with limited or no produce record, as well as subjective descriptions written by the individual consignors. Tranter changed this so emphasis was placed on the performance and production history of the horse's closest relatives, limiting the page to three to four dams with detailed information about the horse's dam's performance. Tranter also insisted on health certificates for all horses entered into his sales and pregnancy certificates for broodmares offered in foal. Fasig-Tipton was the first <b>horse</b> <b>sales</b> company to do this.|$|R
