40|$|An {{interactive}} {{picture processing}} system {{was developed for}} semi-automatic processing of the NOAA- 3 -type weather satellites picture data. This {{can be helpful in}} cases where the experiences and the knowledge of the meteorologists can support the digital data processing. Also the system serves as a quick-look image display. A precision color-TV monitor is used with a 19 -inch screen, operating according to the TV-standards. This monitor receives the picture data from a core-memory which is the interface to a PDP 11 / 45 digital data-processor. The separate core-memory comprises 163 840 18 -bit-locations and is organized as a random access memory with respect to a maximum flexibility. The capacity of the memory was chosen to be sufficient for operating in a section of the screen where the distortions are negligible. The core-memory is used as a quick <b>image</b> <b>refreshing</b> memory as well as a buffer equalizing the highly from each other differing transfer rates by transferring data from the processor to the memory and from the memory to the TV-monitor. A TV-camera is coupled with the core-memory to enable the operator to put additional informations on the screen or to feed this information to the processor. By using a light-dot receiver, the operator can pick up co-ordinate values from the monitor screen to be transferred to the core-memory or to the processor. Also marking signals can be transferred to the screen as well by hand as by a mini computer...|$|E
40|$|Ground Based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars (GB-InSAR) {{have proved}} to be fully {{operational}} tools for the monitoring of ground displacement and structural deformation. The main limiting factor of the existing systems is the time to acquire a single image, typically ranging from few seconds to few minutes. This paper presents the validation and the operational use of a new system – Mimo Enhanced Linear Short SAr (MELISSA), belonging to a new class of GB-InSAR devices. MELISSA is based on a Multiple Input Multiple Output Synthetic Aperture Radar (MIMO SAR) and is capable of acquiring and processing image data at an unprecedented high speed. A configuration of the system acquiring a 0. 96 m synthetic aperture and 260 m swath image in 2. 6 ms was tested in a controlled environment. The results prove its ability to reach an <b>image</b> <b>refreshing</b> time smaller than 4 ms and Line-Of-Sight (LOS) displacement accuracies better than 10 um. Thus, MELISSA was able to help with the monitoring of the Costa Concordia ship movements {{in the immediate aftermath of}} grounding during both the rescue operations and subsequent wreckage removal. The accurate displacement measurements of specific points of the structure are presented in a global interferogram sequence (2 -D displacement maps of the whole structure). The collected data contributed to a precise wreck deformation reconstruction. MELISSA’s ability to update the information almost every second has proven to be extremely reassuring as early warning on potentially catastrophic movements. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|E

5000|$|Response time {{compensation}} {{is also known}} as [...] "Overdrive". LCDs moderate light flow by rotating liquid crystal molecules to various alignments where they transmit more or less light depending on the electrical setting at each individual pixel. The speed at which these liquid crystal molecules rotate is relatively slow, below the <b>image</b> <b>refresh</b> rate. As a consequence, when a scene is changing fast or there is a fast moving image being displayed (such as a golf ball flying off the head of a club) the object is at best blurry and can disappear from the image entirely. Overdrive attempts to compensate for this by, instead of sending the desired voltage to each pixel, it sends a higher initial voltage and then moderates that voltage in order to drive the rotation of the liquid crystal faster. Electrically it [...] "steps on the gas" [...] {{in order to get to}} the right speed quickly, then eases off as it approaches the desired performance level.|$|R

40|$|Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) display <b>images</b> <b>refreshed</b> at high frequency, and the {{temporal}} waveform of each pixel is a luminance impulse {{only a few}} milliseconds long. Although humans are perceptually oblivious to this flicker, we show in V 1 in macaque monkeys and in humans that extracellularly recorded action potentials (spikes) and visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) align with the video impulses, particularly when high-contrast stimuli are viewed. Of 91 single units analyzed in macaque with a 60 Hz video refresh, 29 cells (32 %) significantly locked their firing to a uniform luminance display, but their number increased to 75 (82 %) when high-contrast stimuli were shown. Of 92 cells exposed to a 100 Hz refresh, 21 (23 %) significantly phase locked to high-contrast stimuli. Phase locking occurred in both input and output layers of V 1 for simple and complex cells, regardless of preferred temporal frequency. VEPs recorded in humans showed significant phase locking to the video refresh in all seven observers. Like the monkey neurons, human VEPs more typically phase locked to stimuli containing spatial contrast than to spatially uniform stimuli. Phase locking decreased when the refresh rate was increased. Thus in humans and macaques phase locking to the high strobe frequency of a CRT is enhanced by a salient spatial pattern, although the perceptual impact is uncertain. We note that a billion people worldwide manage to watch TV without obvious distortion of their visual perception despite extraordinary phase locking of their V 1 s to a 50 or 60 Hz signal.

5000|$|Since the {{shutters}} used in liquid crystal displays for each pixel {{stay at a}} steady opacity, they do not flicker, even when the <b>image</b> is <b>refreshed.</b> The backlights of such displays typically operate {{in the range of}} 150-250 Hz. But, to save the crystals from deterioration caused by constant current, voltage is constantly reversed, which may cause flicker. [...] "In a pixel on an LCD monitor, the amount of light that is transmitted from the backlight depends on the voltage applied to the pixel. For the amount of light, it doesn't matter whether that voltage is negative or positive. However, applying the same voltage for a long period would damage the pixel. For example, electricity decomposes water into oxygen and hydrogen gas. A comparable similar effect could happen inside the liquid crystals that are in the pixels. In order to prevent damage, LCD displays quickly alternate the voltage between positive and negative for each pixel, which is called 'polarity inversion'. Ideally, the rapid polarity inversion wouldn't be noticeable because every pixel has the same brightness whether a positive or a negative voltage is applied. However, in practice, there is a small difference, which means that every pixel flickers at about 30 hertz." ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Multidisciplinary team (MDT) cancer {{meetings}} are frequently {{too large to}} be held in radiology departments, although much of the discussion at MDT meetings revolves around the radiologist’s interpretation of the patient’s imaging. Our hospital, like many district general hospitals (DGHs) in the UK, does not have a full PACS system so the radiologist has to show the films either on a viewing box or via an OHP. Aim: To modify a PC based 3 D volume rendering application developed by two of us (RSR and RL) for research purposes into a more user friendly application for presenting good quality radiological images, extracted from DICOM files, via a data projector at our weekly MDT meetings. Methods and Results: DICOM files from a selection of patients who had undergone high resolution multidetector row CT scans were burned to CD using the existing CT workstation facilities. The new software runs on a modern laptop computer with a powerful graphics card (128 MB Nvidia GeForce FX), and accesses data directly from these CDs. The quality of the <b>images</b> and their <b>refresh</b> rate was judged to be as fast as the hospital’s SG Workstations. The visualisation options include 3 D volume view, axial, coronal and sagittal views, maximum intensity projection (MIP), multi-planar reformatting (MPR), and moveable cut planes. Other features include interactive window/level and transfer function, and the ability to save images to bitmap format. Ease of use is an important consideration in the MDT setting and the software has been designed so that all of these features are selected using simple menus. Clinicians and particularly their trainees attending the MDT meetings at which the patients’ radiological images were projected up onto a large screen seem to appreciate their clarity and the ability to both see and think in 3 D with the aid of the MPR facility. Conclusions: We have shown (1) that with our software and a suitable laptop computer costing about £ 2 K it is possible to reproduce virtually all of the common functions that can be currently found on a SG Workstation costing 6 – 10 times as much and (2) linking such a system to a data projector is a relatively inexpensive way of showing radiological images at large MDT meetings...|$|R
