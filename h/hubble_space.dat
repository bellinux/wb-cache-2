5|$|STS-125, or HST-SM4 (<b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope Servicing Mission 4), was {{the fifth}} and final space shuttle mission to the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope (HST).|$|E
5|$|Further {{observations}} {{have been}} made by Cassini–Huygens in 2000 and New Horizons in 2007, as well as from Earth-based telescopes and the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, NASA {{accepted}} the donation of two space telescopes from the National Reconnaissance Office. Despite being stored unused, the instruments {{are superior to}} the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the Dawn spacecraft, some Vestan surface {{features}} had already been resolved using the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and ground-based telescopes (e.g. the Keck Observatory).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards {{from the}} Space Foundation, for its {{outreach}} activities, in 2001 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a replica}} of the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope on the {{courthouse}} lawn in Marshfield, Missouri, the hometown of namesake Edwin P. Hubble.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope {{detected}} {{water vapor}} plumes above the {{south polar region}} of Europa, one of Jupiter's Galilean moons. It is thought that Europa's lineae might be venting this water vapor into space, caused by similar processes also occurring on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that NASA <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope had detected hydrogen and helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55Cancrie, the first time the atmosphere of a super-earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn {{team was}} granted viewing {{time on the}} <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope in September 2007 for a once-in-twenty-year {{opportunity}} to view Pallas at closest approach, to obtain comparative data for Ceres and Vesta.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope {{celebrated its}} 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) {{released}} an {{image from the}} Carina Nebula.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{has also}} been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen geocorona. The amount of hydrogen present in Callisto's atmosphere varies depending {{on the stage of}} its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{part of the}} {{constellation}} {{was the subject of}} a two-week observation program by the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope, which resulted in the Hubble Deep Field South. The potential area to be covered needed to be at the poles of the telescope's orbit for continuous observing, with the final choice resting upon the discovery of a quasar, QSO J2233-606, in the field.|$|E
5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2006, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which {{cast a shadow}} {{that could be seen}} on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} visit to the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope for Atlantis; the {{telescope}} had been previously serviced twice by Discovery and once each by Columbia and Endeavour. The mission was the 30th flight of Space Shuttle Atlantis and also the first by Atlantis in over 14 years not to visit a space station, the last one being STS-66.|$|E
5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding that level, on November 27, 2001 the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope {{detected}} sodium, {{the first}} planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. This detection was predicted by Sara Seager in late 2001. The {{core of the}} sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This {{turns out to be}} about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope (HST) has {{adequate}} {{angular resolution}} {{to separate the}} light from the moons from that of Haumea. Photometry of the Haumea triple system with HST's NICMOS camera has confirmed that the spectral line at 1.6µm that indicates the presence of water ice is at least as strong in the moons' spectra as in Haumea's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope, which {{cannot be}} pointed {{directly}} at the Sun, used the Moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of Venus {{in order to determine}} its composition. This will help to show whether a similar technique could be used to study exoplanets.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of the entire universe. This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A {{occurred}} on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC) Unit on the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope failed. Because of its {{importance to the}} telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. Atlantis was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October.|$|E
5|$|Uranus was {{the last}} giant planet without any known {{irregular}} moons, but since 1997 nine distant irregular moons have been identified using ground-based telescopes. Two more small inner moons, Cupid and Mab, were discovered using the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope in 2003. As of 2016, the moon Margaret {{was the last}} Uranian moon discovered, and its characteristics were published in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{with the}} Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope, first {{described}} in 1995, revealed that Europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa's atmosphere is 0.1μPa, or 10−12 {{times that of}} the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing evidence of an atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary astrometric {{measurements}} {{suggest the}} orbit of Upsilon Andromedae d may be inclined at 155.5° to {{the plane of the}} sky. However, these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits; worthless for HD 192263 b and probably 55 Cancri c, and contradict even the inner planet u And b's inclination of >30°. The mutual inclination between c and d meanwhile is 29.9 degrees. The true inclination of Upsilon Andromedae d was determined as 23.8° after combined results were measured from the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{progress}} in Big Bang cosmology {{has been made}} since the late 1990s {{as a result of}} advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that {{the expansion of the universe}} appears to be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Styx was {{discovered}} by {{a team led by}} astronomer Mark R. Showalter, using fourteen sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by the Wide Field Camera 3 fitted to the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope. The discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. Styx is about half as bright as the dimmest previously known object in the system, Kerberos, and about one hundred thousandth as bright as Pluto. It was designated S/2012 (134340) 1, and informally referred to as P5.|$|E
