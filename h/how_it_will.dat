He has expressed interest in learning from the creative process as artists make intellectual decisions about their work on reflection of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be received by others and the market. He has published essays in multiple academic art journals, contributed to Grove Art Online, and co-edited a volume on independent African art initiatives.|$|E

She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before. After a rough first night, she decides to have fun with the experience and behave as if everything is normal.

PSAs do not cover responses to emergencies (both day-to-day emergencies and those covered by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004), extra police provision for hijack designated airports, border control work or protection against man-portable air-defense systems. The new Framework also includes expanded powers of dispute resolution for the Secretary of State for Transport, and provides for recourse to judicial review by the High Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic concept}} was {{primarily}} {{developed in the}} non-positivist theory of Max Weber to observe how human behaviors relate to cause and effect in the social realm. For Weber, sociology {{is the study of}} society and behavior and must therefore look at the heart of interaction. The theory of social action, more than structural functionalist positions, accepts and assumes that humans vary their actions according to social contexts and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> affect other people; when a potential reaction is not desirable, the action is modified accordingly. Action can mean either a basic action (one that has a meaning) or an advanced social action, which not only has a meaning but is directed at other actors and causes action (or, perhaps, inaction).|$|E

25|$|A central {{feature of}} honing theory {{is the notion}} of a {{potentiality}} state. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.|$|E
25|$|As an example, marlin lures are {{typically}} 7-14 inches or more long with a shaped plastic or metal {{head and a}} plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along {{in a straight line}} with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers fine tune their lures to get the action they want.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{the type}} of ceramic will affect <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> break down. Unfired clay, like mud and clay adobe, is clay that is fired under 1000°C or 1832°F. This type of clay is {{water-soluble}} and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200°C or 1832°-2192°F. The firing makes the clay water insoluble but does not allow {{the formation of an}} extensive glassy or vitreous within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400°C or 2192-2552°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface. However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.|$|E

25|$|Soil carbon {{storage is}} an {{important}} function of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil contains more carbon than plants and the atmosphere combined. Understanding what maintains the soil carbon pool {{is important to understand}} the current distribution of carbon on Earth, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> respond to environmental change. While much research has been done on how plants, free-living microbial decomposers, and soil minerals affect this pool of carbon, it is recently coming to light that mycorrhizal fungi—symbiotic fungi that associate with roots of almost all living plants—may {{play an important role in}} maintaining this pool as well. Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake, and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots. Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden. Turnover of mycorrhizal biomass into the soil carbon pool is thought to be rapid and has been shown in some ecosystems to be the dominant pathway by which living carbon enters the soil carbon pool.|$|E
