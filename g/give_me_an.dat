500|$|Many {{scenes in}} [...] "The Mansion Family" [...] were {{inspired}} by popular culture. For example, there is a painting hanging {{on one of the}} walls in Burns' mansion that depicts Burns playing poker with dogs, referencing the oil paintings series Dogs Playing Poker. Another painting, showing a nude Burns, is a callback to a previous episode of the series, [...] "Brush with Greatness" [...] (1991), in which Marge produced the painting for Burns. Featured in the episode is also a joke that makes fun of the Grammy Awards. During the awards ceremony, Homer complains, [...] "Why won't anyone <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> award?" [...] When Lisa points out that [...] "You won a Grammy," [...] Homer says [...] "I mean an award that's worth winning." [...] At this point the screen freezes and a message scrolls across {{the bottom of the screen}} reading [...] "LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Mr. Simpson's opinions do not reflect those of the producers, who don't consider the Grammy an award at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He saved my career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He promised me he'd give me the football and <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> offensive line, and he sure kept his word." [...] The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{described}} it as [...] "another fine, fine Lost". [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson gave the episode an [...] "A", calling it [...] "one of those dense, chewy episodes in {{which a lot of}} stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale." [...] She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost … can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [...] ghosts aren't my thing." [...] The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter decided that [...] "what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [...] Jack's flashforward [...] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [...] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [...]" [...] Daniel of TMZ graded [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] as a [...] "B". [...] In his recap, he wrote that [...] "if that's the last we ever see of Claire again, that would be BEYOND awesome." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a long {{interview}} {{conducted by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Jelly Roll Morton recalled {{that the first}} blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in Garden District, New Orleans. Morton sang the blues: [...] "Can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ You can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine".

But you ought to have regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pause and probe is {{the skill}} of the {{moderator}} to give each participant a chance to jump in. As a general rule, a moderator should pause {{for at least five}} seconds after a participant talks or before beginning to talk. Probes, such as [...] "would you explain that further?" [...] or [...] "Would you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> example?" [...] help to give additional information. Being prepared for the unexpected is one of the abilities of the focus group leaders in order for the efficient functioning of the groups. Some examples of unexpected events are no one showing up (make sure you bring list and phone numbers), only a few showing up (hold group anyway), meeting place is inadequate for the members to reach, the group members get too involved and don't want to leave (have formal ending), bad or hazardous weather (call everyone and cancel). Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of the focus group has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion. This allows the member to have some time to review the topics and focus on key relevant issues. The leader should use the counseling skills in order for the discussion to take place effectively.|$|E
