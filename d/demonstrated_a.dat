5|$|In April 2007, the NIST's {{implementation}} of the Kibble balance <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36µg and a short-term resolution of µg. The UK's National Physical Laboratory's Kibble balance <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> CRSU of 70.3µg in 2007. That Kibble balance was disassembled and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue.|$|E

5|$|After her graduation, Kirchherr {{enrolled}} in the Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Graphik und Werbung in Hamburg, as she wanted to study fashion design but <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> talent for black-and-white photography. Reinhard Wolf, the school's main photographic tutor, convinced her to switch courses and promised that he would hire her as his assistant when she graduated. Kirchherr worked for Wolf as his assistant from 1959 until 1963.|$|E

Salmonella Typhimurium was bound one to two orders of magnitude more than E. coli F 4. We could <b>demonstrate</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant correlation between mannan and glucan content and pathogen binding. Furthermore we could <b>demonstrate</b> <b>a</b> relative influence of the production process autolysis.|$|R

40|$|This {{course is}} {{designed}} to be a study of interpersonal techniques in the counseling relationship. This is a helping relationship and counseling techniques class designed for counselors, clergy, and other mental health professionals. Students will learn to integrate the major schools of counseling; interpersonal self-exploration; and biblical, theological, and psychological themes into the helping relationship. OBJECTIVES As a result of his or her experiences in this course, the student should be able to: 1. <b>Demonstrate</b> <b>an</b> understanding of the major schools of counseling. 2. <b>Demonstrate</b> <b>an</b> understanding of the various counseling techniques used in the helping relationship. 3. <b>Demonstrate</b> <b>an</b> understanding of their own psychological history that shapes their current personal worldview. 4. <b>Demonstrate</b> <b>an</b> ability to integrate the schools of counseling, personal worldview, biblical worldview, and theological themes into the helping relationship. 5. <b>Demonstrate</b> <b>an</b> awareness of ethical behavior in counseling and when it is necessary to mak...|$|R

A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E

It was joined by McAfee and Symantec later that year. In May 2015, Fortinet acquired the Silicon Valley-based Wi-Fi hardware company, Meru Networks, for $44 million. In late 2015, Fortinet security researchers <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> Fitbit hack that gained access through Bluetooth, then allowed the hacker into synchronized devices.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> relative uncertainty of 1.5%. Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA {{were expected to}} accumulate a mass of 30g in six days {{and to have a}} relative uncertainty of better than 1ppm. Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|In November 1989, IBM {{scientists}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> technology {{capable of}} manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three letter company initialism.

5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E

Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz {{created a new}} school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>a</b> {{rich and}} nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of}} the woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
