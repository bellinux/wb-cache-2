40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{work has}} argued that a small open economy should use residence-based but not source-based taxes on capital income. Given the ease which which residents can evade domestic taxes on foreign earnings from capital, however, a residence-based tax may not be administratively feasible, leaving no taxes on capital income. The objective {{of this paper is}} to explore possible reasons why capital-income taxes have survived in the past, in spite of the above pressures. Any bilateral approach, such as sharing of information among governments or direct coordination of tax rates, suffers from the problem that the coalition of countries is itself a small open economy, so subject to the same pressures. Capital controls, preventing capital outflows, may bell be a sensible policy response and were in fact used by a number of countries. Such controls have many drawbacks, however, and a number of countries are now abandoning them. The final hypothesis explored is that the tax-crediting conventions, used to prvent the <b>double</b> <b>taxations</b> of international capital flows, served also to coordinate tax rataes. The paper shows that while no Nash equilibrium in tax rates exists, given these tax-crediting conventions, a Stackelberg equilibrium does exist if there is either a dominant capital exporter or a dominant capital importer, in spite of the ease of tax evasion. While the U. S., as the dominant capital exporter during much of the postwar period, may well have served as this Stackelberg leader, world capital markets are now more complicated. These tax-crediting conventions may no longer be sufficient to sustain capital-income taxation...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the current}} “state of the art” {{of the tax}} harmonization across the European Union, and the {{attention is focused on}} the three most important drivers of this evolution o the national taxation systems of the Member states. The first one is the Treaty and the fundamental freedoms enshrined in it. In particular, the author emphasises the importance of the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capitals as provisions adequate to prevent international <b>double</b> <b>taxations</b> or an overall unfair taxation in one state of the Union or in another. The second one is the contribute of the European Court of Justice which stretched to the very limits the interpretation of the fundamental rights in order to cover the possible loopholes of positive EU law on Direct taxation. In other words, where a specific competence of European Union to legislate on tax matters is missing, then the same result could be possibly obtained interpreting the mentioned above basic rules of the Treaty. The third one is formed by the few directives on Direct taxation which have been passed by the Council in the last decades and covering mainly the so called passive income (interests, royalties and dividends) considered as a sort of priority in the Union policy. The reason justifying this intervention {{can be found in the}} fact that these very income are the most influenced by the not complete harmonization of the Treaty and the ones which more than any others are feasible to be produced in a cross border context. While labour income, for instance, is generally produced by workers in the states where they also resides, with some remarkable exceptions, it is quite common for a company to have non resident shareholders, or to have a loan from a non resident corporation or bank. The author analyses the content of the most important directives pinpointing the aspects which are relevant also for the non European investors in any Member state and the possibility for permanent establishment as well to invoke the protection of EU Tax law...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we set up}} a model of {{start-up}} finance under double moral hazard. Entre-preneurs lack own resources and business experience to develop their ideas. Venture capitalists can provide start-up finance and commercial support. The effort put forth by either agent contributes to the firm’s success, but is not verifiable. As a result, the market equilibrium is biased towards ineffi-ciently low venture capital support. The capital gains tax becomes especially harmful, as it further impairs advice and causes a first-order welfare loss. Once the capital gains tax is in place, limitations on loss off-set may paradoxically contribute to higher quality of venture capital finance and welfare. Subsidies to physical investment in VC-backed start-ups are detrimental in our framework. Key words: capital gains <b>taxation,</b> <b>double</b> moral hazard, venture capita...|$|R
25|$|Most governments take revenue which {{exceeds that}} {{which can be}} {{provided}} by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a <b>double</b> dividend. Optimal <b>taxation</b> theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes {{in terms of social}} welfare. The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the elasticity of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function, which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. If individuals experience diminishing returns from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} {{has been involved in}} a sustained war against objectionable foreign tax credit transactions. This war has caused the U. S. foreign tax credit regime to be riddled with complexity that spawns incoherent outcomes. The complexity contained in section 901 was created due to a legitimate concern: the threats posed by objectionable transactions that artificially generate excess foreign tax credits represent real policy problems. Since at least 1975, Congress and the Treasury Department have been convinced that the cross-crediting of excess foreign tax credits arising from “objectionable transactions” required a response in addition to simply relying on section 904. Thus, it is understandable that Congress and the Treasury Department would seek to redefine the foreign tax credit eligibility standards in response to transactions that generate foreign tax credits in objectionable ways. However, the historical record indicates that Congress and the Treasury Department ran roughshod over section 901 and used a scorched earth approach in their war against objectionable foreign tax credit transactions. The result is that the U. S. foreign tax credit regime is a “byzantine structure of staggering complexity. ” In the rush to enact reforms, ill-conceived provisions were enacted that should not have been enacted. Objectionable foreign tax credit transactions needed principled responses, and principled responses were enacted {{in the midst of a}} scattergun attack on these objectionable transactions. However, the United States must have a principled foreign tax credit regime that balances the need to prevent international <b>double</b> income <b>taxation</b> with the need to prevent abusive transactions. This Article addresses the disallowance provisions that have been added to section 901 as part of the government’s war against objectionable foreign tax credit transactions and assesses which of those provisions serve a continuing policy objective and which do not. This Article argues that U. S. tax law would be greatly improved if section 901 embodied a principled approach and if redundant provisions that create incoherent outcomes were removed...|$|R

40|$|Over time, the tax {{systems have}} been a major source of revenue {{generation}} for several governments. Its history dates back to Bible times. Tax therefore becomes the civic responsibility of individuals and corporate organizations with the understanding that its proceeds will enhance governmental projects {{for the benefit of the}} society.

The implications of such impact on the Nigerian tax systems were drawn in an attempt to avert extreme effects like dissension. We discovered that the Solomonic Era was characterized by heavy taxation. Beyond the multiplicity of direct tax, thousands of Israelites were drawn into unpaid labor force.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{fiscal burden}} in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{countries}} more than <b>doubles</b> the overall <b>taxation</b> level in Latin American countries. In terms of revenue composition, OECD countries collect {{a larger share}} from direct taxes; {{there is also a}} greater component from social contributions. During the nineties, the revival of economic growth and the design of better tax systems enabled fiscal revenues to recover strongly, reaching an increase of 3 points of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). However, this effort has not been sufficient, considering the dynamics of public debt in an environment of high interest rates and low growth. In this paper, the main trends of tax burden and composition of tax revenues in Latin American countries are described, and then the short-term tax-gap, as OECD has defined it, are calculated for 18 countries. The reversal of economic cycle makes impossible to fill this gap in the short term without significant macroeconomic costs. Some room of manoeuvre, namely a cyclical safety margin, has to be considered. The magnitude of this cyclical safety margin is very significant, because of the volatility of output and the high value of tax elasticities, despite the relatively minor size of public sector when compared to OECD standards. If fiscal policy is more efficient when letting operate automatic stabilisers, then second generation" macro fiscal rules will have to address {{on the issue of the}} pronounced pro-cyclical bias that defined fiscal policies in the nineties in many Latin American countries. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of a double dividend from revenue-neutral ecological tax reforms (an ecological advantage plus an economic advantage) has recently become a widely discussed topic both in real-world economic policy and in economic theory. The subject has produced many advocates and opponents in the scientific community. This paper examines potential economic dividends from revenue-neutral ecological tax reforms by systematically distinguishing between an efficiency dividend and an employment dividend. Their occurrence is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} two different theoretical approaches: namely, the optimal taxation view and the market process view. According to the optimal taxation view, which dominates recent economic analysis on this subject, an efficiency dividend seems doubtful whereas an employment dividend is likely to occur under specific circumstances (e. g. involuntary unemployment and sub-optimal initial tax system). However, there is a considerable number of unsuitable assumptions which create doubt when questioning how appropriate the use of optimal taxation theory is when discussing real-world ecological tax reforms. The market process view enlarges the analysis by integrating effects on and from competition and innovation. This strengthens the occurrence of an employment dividend in an imperfect world with involuntary unemployment. In this framework the reduction of involuntary unemployment results from declining wage costs which boost labour demand, a shift in the bias of the innovation process, and an evolution of the consumption basket because of changing relative prices. environmental <b>taxation,</b> <b>double</b> dividend, market process theory, involuntary unemployment...|$|R

He was the royal {{treasurer}} of Şahin Giray, the last Crimean Khan, and therefore is called in Karaite literature ha-Neeman ("the Trusted")—an appellation bestowed also upon his father Samuel, {{who died in}} 1770, and who probably held the same office under former khans. When Şahin Giray fled for his life from his rebellious subjects, and sought succor from his protectress Catherine II in St. Petersburg, Benjamin Aga followed him, hoping to collect the large sums of money that he had advanced to the fugitive. Following the last partition of Poland in 1795, after Crimea had been under Russian rule for over a decade, Vilnius, Lutsk and Trakai came under Russian Rule. Benjamin Aga, Solomon ben Nahamu Bobowitz, and the astronomer Isaac of Kalea, the son-in-law of Jacob Aga, who was the elder brother of Benjamin, went to St. Petersburg as a delegation from the Crimean Karaites, to petition the empress to release their sect from the <b>double</b> rate of <b>taxation</b> which all the Jews then had to pay. Through the intervention of Count Nikolay Zubov, the delegation obtained from the empress the exemption from the [...] "Jewish" [...] taxes, some land grants, and other privileges which had not been asked for. This established an important precedent for exempting the Karaites from subsequent anti-Jewish legislation. The extraordinary success of the mission served to arouse great enthusiasm among the Karaites, and Aga and his fellow delegates were received with great honor on their return.

40|$|Internet, taxation, {{electronic}} commerce The Internet {{has not only}} changed the way business is conducted but also raised issues such as Internet taxation that are awaiting to be resolved. Taxes are the major sources of financing for governments, which in turn, use them to provide public goods and services. Thus, each government has its own tax policies imposed on taxpayers within its boundaries. The Internet, on the other hand, diminishes the boundaries set forth by governments as well as dematerialising money, products and taxpayers which constitute the basis for taxation, making tax collection even more difficult than ever. Uncertain rules regarding the taxation of the Internet pose a crucial problem that calls for all governments to collaborate for a uniform solution. Unless there is a global perspective on the issue, the governments will be confronted with greater tax evasion, a larger underground economy and fiercer tax competition from other countries. As put forth by the OECD, the U. S. and the European Union, the collaborative solution must ensure that fiscal sovereignty of governments are not undermined, <b>double</b> or no <b>taxation</b> of e-commerce is avoided and the tax base from e-commerce is shared fairly between countries.
