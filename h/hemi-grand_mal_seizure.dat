40|$|The {{generalized}} convulsion or grand mal {{attack of}} epilepsy usually presents such a striking picture of somatic motor phenomena that {{signs and symptoms}} involving visceral and other autonomic functions, while present, are overshadowed. Within the grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure</b> there usually occur cardiorespiratory, gastro-intestinal, urinary, and other autonomic symptoms. Prior to a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure</b> {{there may be a}} visceral aura. This is often an epigastric or abdominal sensation and may occur in as often as 20 per cent of the patients. During a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure</b> patients become cyanotic, have disordered respirations, tachycardia, occasional vomiting, involuntary defecation and urination, sweating, increase in blood pressure and pupillary changes. Some of these symptoms may persist after the main portion of the seizure, and there may be a fever, especially in children. Aside from these manifestations, occurring in some relation to a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure,</b> there are many instances of visceral phenomena representing in themselves the major portion of a seizure state. These often occur i...|$|R
40|$|Neurogenic, or postictal, {{pulmonary}} edema {{is a rare}} complication of grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> At present, the etiology of this disorder is complex and not understood fully. This report describes {{a case of a}} young man who was previously healthy, but who subsequently developed acute {{pulmonary edema}} after a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure.</b> The patient presented with gross hemoptysis, which has not been described previously in this disorder. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic pulmonary edema are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{a man who}} had two grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures,</b> each one followed by a lengthy period of unconsciousness during which he was extremely restless, with violent uncoordinated movements. This was probably a form of status epilepticus conforming to a diagnosis of grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure,</b> followed by a complex partial seizure, but was similar to what has been described as post epileptic mania or delirium. A brief historical perspective is included together with a resumé of the differential diagnosis of adult onset epilepsy...|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} itself {{matched the}} initial 70 volts given by Ugo Cerletti {{in his first}} ECT three years earlier in Rome. In both Impastato's and Cerletti's patients this voltage elicited a petit <b>mal</b> <b>seizure.</b> Cerletti's patient responded by speaking coherently {{for the first time}} in years. Cerletti went on to induce a grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizure</b> in the patient at a higher voltage before concluding the treatment. Impastato advisedly set his parameters for a single-stage petit mal procedure which required only one assistant besides the operator to ensure patient safety.|$|R
40|$|Electrodermal {{activity}} and electrodermal biofeedback, when integrated into pharmacologic treatments, are promising methods for grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> They {{can be used}} to monitor the patient arousal and help the patient learn some new strategies for better coping with stress and anxiety. Our proposed method can possibly reduce the number of crises for patients who are dependent on pharmacologic therapy and can also improve their quality of life. This article describes the scientific background of electrodermal monitoring and electrodermal biofeedback for patients affected by grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> In this study, we have reported a clinical case study. A patient is treated for two years with electrodermal biofeedback to augment pharmacologic treatments. The trial has been designed according to a n= 1 case study research. Our results showed that our methods can achieve a significant reduction in grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> and sympathetic arousal. The patient in consideration was also relaxed and exhibited a greater competency in coping with stress. In addition, the patient’s sense of mastery and self-efficacy was enhanced...|$|R

50|$|Tonic-clonic {{seizures}} (formerly {{known as}} grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures)</b> are {{a type of}} generalized seizure that affects the entire brain.

50|$|When doctors {{diagnose}} thought blocking, it {{is important}} that they consider other causes of pauses in speech and expression, such as petit <b>mal</b> <b>seizures,</b> aphasia, hesitation brought on by anxiety, or slow thought processes.

40|$|A 40 -year-old man {{was brought}} to {{hospital}} because of grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> in July, 2000. Seven hours before admission, he vomited once and drank approximately 6 liters of water within two hours because of throat discomfort. Thirty minutes later, he suffered six grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> His medical history included cerebral palsy {{at the age of}} one year complicated with mental retardation and absence epilepsy. He was treated with halo-peridol 6. 5 mg, biperiden 9 mg, phenytoin 300 mg, clonazepam 3 mg, levomepromazine 185 mg, and carbamazepine 500 mg daily. History of primary polydipsia was not evident. On physi-cal examination, the patient was unresponsive with blood pres-sure 118 / 70 mmHg,pulse rate 92 /min, and temperature of 37. 5 °C. Skin turgor was normal. Gingival hyperplasia prob-ably induced by phenytoin was noted. There were no focal neurological signs. Laboratory parameters included leukocyt...|$|R

5000|$|Absence {{seizures}} are one {{of several}} kinds of seizures. These seizures are {{sometimes referred to as}} petit <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> (from the French for [...] "little illness", a term dating from the late 18th century).

40|$|Cortical {{blindness}} following grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> {{occurred in}} five adult patients. The causes of seizures included idiopathic epilepsy, vascular accident, brain cyst, acute encephalitis and chronic encephalitis.

50|$|Seizures which {{begin in}} the {{temporal}} lobe, and then spread to involve the whole brain are known as Secondarily Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (SGTCS).

Secondarily generalized tonic clonic seizures are known in the vernacular as convulsions or grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures.</b> The word grand mal comes from the French term, meaning major affliction.|$|R

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of refractory epilepsy {{can be reduced}} by cutting the corpus callosum in an operation known as a corpus callosotomy. This is usually reserved for cases in which complex or grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> are produced by an epileptogenic focus {{on one side of}} the brain, causing an interhemispheric electrical storm. The work up for this procedure involves an electroencephalogram, MRI, PET scan, and evaluation by a specialized neurologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, and neuroradiologist before surgery can be considered.|$|R
40|$|We {{elaborate}} on the retrospective analysis of clinical data on a patient afflicted with grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures</b> following a kidney transplant. The 16 -year-old female patient was hospitalized for chronic glomerulonephritis. She experienced an epileptic seizure and was treated with carbamazepine. Renal transplantation was performed; {{the function of the}} transplant kidney was normal. However, grand <b>mal</b> <b>seizures,</b> which required intravenous and luminal intramuscular diazepam injections for control, began on the fourth postoperative day and lasted for 3 days, occurring approximately 10 to 20 times per day. On the sixth day, the patient fell into a deep comatose state and developed the inability to move the right side of her body, hypomyotonia, type 1 respiratory failure, and a pulmonary infection. She was given a breathing machine to assist with respiration. At the same time, she was given protection from infection, tranquilization, treatment for dehydration and diuresis, supportive therapy for the right side of her body, and adjustment of her immunosuppressants. On the 12 th postoperative day, the patient's consciousness gradually returned; on the 15 th day, the breathing machine was removed with recovery of myodynamia; on the 27 th day, she was fully cured with no neurological sequelae...|$|R
