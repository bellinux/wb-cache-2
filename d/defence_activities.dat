During this year he also became Professor of Physics and the first Dean of the Faculty of Military Studies for the University of New South Wales, at the Royal Military College, Duntroon until he retired in 1971.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success of}} {{territorial}} female mammals depends partly on their capability {{to defend their}} young from conspecific intruders. However, how this {{is related to the}} characteristics of females and their litter sizes is largely unknown. The <b>defence</b> <b>activity</b> of 25 female bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in relation to the number of offspring was studied in a behavioural arena by manipulating litter sizes (- 2 pups or + 2 pups). Infanticidal male bank voles were used as intruders-predators. Moreover, the weaning success (weaned at least one offspring or none) of 15 pairs of neighbouring females was investigated in a large indoor runway system. In each pair of females, the litter size of one female was reduced (- 2 pups) and the litter size of the other enlarged (+ 2 pups). <b>Defence</b> <b>activity</b> of females increased with the number of offspring and the mother's size. However, weaning success of neighbours was related only to their body mass, and litter-size manipulation did not affect weaning success. Present results indicate that, although bank vole females increase their defence intensity with {{an increase in the number}} of pups, the weaning success of neighbouring females may be primarily determined by their size and dominance rank...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} post-bid <b>defence</b> <b>activity</b> for a sample of takeover bids in the UK. We find {{that most of the}} defences investigated promote the interests of target managers by significantly lowering the probability of bid success. We also find that most of the defences promote the interests of shareholders by increasing wealth gains by an amount that varies between 9 % and 14 %. These results suggest that bid resistance is to the mutual benefit of the managers and shareholders of target firms. This conclusion is in line with recent developments in agency theory.

Tu-22P Blinder-E electronic jammers were given the task of covering the withdrawal route back to the Soviet Union. Radar-jamming Tu-22PD aircraft covered Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers operating out of the Mary-2 airfield in the Turkmen SSR on missions in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They protected the strike aircraft against Pakistani F-16 air <b>defence</b> <b>activity</b> and suppressed radar systems which could aid Pakistani F-16 attacks on the Soviet bombers in the border region. Tu-22PD crews were also tasked with photo-reconnaissance missions, to assess bomb-damage, in addition to their primary electronic warfare missions.|$|R

5000|$|While {{there is}} not yet a broadly {{accepted}} definition of defence diplomacy, it can be understood as the peaceful application of resources from across the spectrum of defence, to achieve positive outcomes {{in the development of a}} country’s bilateral and multilateral relationships. [...] "Military diplomacy" [...] is a sub-set of this, tending to refer only to the role of military attachés and their associated <b>activity.</b> <b>Defence</b> diplomacy does not include military operations, but subsumes such other <b>defence</b> <b>activity</b> as international personnel exchanges, ship and aircraft visits, high level engagement (e.g. Ministers and senior defence personnel), bilateral meetings and staff talks, training and exercises, regional defence forums (e.g. Shangri-La Dialogue, Halifax Forum), outreach, confidence and security building measures, and non-proliferation activities. The United Kingdom identified defence diplomacy as one of the military’s eight defence missions, and aims to “dispel hostility, build and maintain trust and assist in the development of democratically accountable armed forces” to make a “significant contribution to conflict prevention and resolution.” Defence diplomacy is often developed and implemented in close coordination with the foreign and development ministries to ensure coherence and focus across government.|$|R

40|$|Beneficial {{microbes}} typically produce bioactive {{molecules that}} can affect the interactions of plants with their pathogens. Many secondary metabolites may also have antibiotic properties, which enable the producing microbe to inhibit and/or kill other microorganisms i. e. competing for a nutritional niche. Indeed, some of these compounds {{have been found to}} play an important role in the biocontrol of plant diseases by various beneficial microbes used world-wide for crop protection and bio-fertilization. In addition to direct toxic activity against plant pathogens, biocontrol-related metabolites may also increase disease resistance by triggering systemic plant <b>defence</b> <b>activity,</b> and/or enhance root and shoot growth. Fungi belonging to the Trichoderma genus are well known producers of secondary metabolites with a direct activity against phytopathogens and compounds that substantially affect the metabolism of the plant. The widescale application of selected metabolites to induce host resistance and/or to promote crop yield may become a reality in the near future and represents a powerful tool for the implementation of IPM strategies...|$|R
