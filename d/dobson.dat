50|$|Jill Farren Phelps {{took over}} as {{executive}} producer and kept the position until 1990, when she was replaced by John Conboy, {{although there was a}} five-month transition period where both were credited. In 1990, Pratt was fired and replaced by another associate writer, Maralyn Thoma, but her tenure was cut short when the <b>Dobsons</b> finally settled in court and returned to the series. Shortly before the <b>Dobsons</b> returned, Conboy was let go and Paul Rauch was brought on as executive producer in an ill-advised last-ditch attempt at saving the floundering soap. However, the <b>Dobsons</b> left their head writing duties in 1992, when Pam Long was hired as the show's final head writer.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, at {{the request}} of the England Rugby Board (known as the Rugby Football Union), Bedell-Sivright was {{selected}} to lead a British Lions team on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. He only played in one Test, against Australia, because of a broken leg, but the team did go undefeated in Australiawinning all their matches there, and the three Test matches 17–0, 17–3 and 16–0. A notable incident on the Australian leg of the tour was a dispute between the British side and one of the Australian referees. The refereeHugh Dolan had ordered off British Isles player Denys <b>Dobson</b> after claiming <b>Dobson</b> had directed a personal insult at him. Bedell-Sivright was not playing, but pulled his team from the field for 20 minutes while disputing the decision with Dolan and the other officials. Eventually the British side returned to play, but without <b>Dobson.</b> Following the match Bedell-Sivright accused the referee of incompetence, and an inquiry eventually cleared <b>Dobson</b> of using indecent language, but he became the first British Isles player ever ordered off.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} three years of the show, the main crew of SB stayed the same, with the <b>Dobsons</b> taking on a double duty as both head writers and {{executive}} producers. Jeffrey Hayden served as co-executive producer during the first year, and Mary-Ellis Bunim took over after him. In 1987, after the <b>Dobsons</b> were abruptly fired, associate head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. received head writing status and Anne Howard Bailey joined him as co-head writer until 1989, when Sheri Anderson took over that duty.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Dobsons</b> (Isaac and Benjamin), Hick, Rothwell, John Kennedy {{and others}} were members of a [...] "prosecution" [...] club (formed 1801), meeting at the Black Horse pub in Bolton, that in 1824 secured an annuity for the {{inventor}} and fellow member Samuel Crompton, who also frequented the Inn. Hick joined the Institute of Civil Engineers in the same year, proposed by Joshua Field, Joseph Farey and James Jones. Also with Rothwell and the <b>Dobsons,</b> Hick was a prominent member of the Black Horse Club, that met [...] "to discuss not only business matters but the most interesting topics affecting that period".|$|R

50|$|In 1988, the <b>Dobsons</b> {{were locked}} out of NBC studios after {{repeated}} attempts to fire the head writer. They sued, and were eventually {{allowed to return to}} the program, but ratings never recovered, even as the show won three Daytime Emmys in a row for Outstanding Drama Series.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 the <b>Dobsons</b> {{were hired}} {{as the head}} writers for the long-running CBS Daytime soap opera Guiding Light. They {{spent the rest of}} the 1970s at Guiding Light where they created {{alluring}} nurse Rita Stapleton (who became the show's heroine for the remainder of the 1970s), the rich, upper class Spaulding family in 1977 (who would remain one of the show's core families until the show's cancellation in 2009), and wrote the infamous storyline of Holly Norris Bauer's rape by her own husband Roger Thorpe in 1979. The <b>Dobsons</b> would later go on to become the head writers of another Procter and Gamble soap opera, As the World Turns where they created the infamous character of James Stenbeck and also paired the characters of Tom and Margo.|$|R
50|$|Born in Ashington, {{he was the}} son of Thomas <b>Dobsons</b> Jacques, a miner and Ann Jaques, (née Bircham) A {{scholarship}} led him to the Co-operative College, {{located in}} Manchester, where he graducated with a Bachelor of Arts in commerce. He then went to Low Moorsley as a secretary-manager of its Co-operative Society in 1925.|$|R

5|$|Amanda Harrison was {{originally}} cast as Elphaba, with Lucy Durack as Glinda. The original cast consisted of Rob Mills as Fiyero, Anthony Callea as Boq, Rob Guest as the Wizard, Maggie Kirkpatrick as Madame Morrible, Penny McNamee as Nessarose and Rodney <b>Dobson</b> as Doctor Dillamond. Guest unexpectedly died {{months into the}} Melbourne season, with the role being taken up by Bert Newton.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has received positive critical response from media critics and achieved popularity with {{both children and}} adults, though he {{has been involved in}} public controversy. SpongeBob appeared in a We Are Family Foundation video promoting tolerance, which was criticized by James <b>Dobson</b> of Focus on the Family because of the foundation's link to homosexuality.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Dobsons</b> though were {{criticized for}} two major story line moves. The first of those was their killing off of Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris Bauer, in June 1976 (by then {{part of what}} {{appeared}} to be a stable couple that could have made Leslie a tent pole character for many years later.) There is disagreements over what made The <b>Dobsons</b> kill off Leslie via a drunk driver, but many in the audience considered this move of killing off of a well-liked heroine the beginning of the end for the show. Another unpopular and to some of the audience odd move, and the direction the story took, by The <b>Dobsons</b> was the bringing back of Bill Bauer from the [...] "dead" [...] in the fall of 1977. This move was met with an unpopular backlash and thought of as odd, because much of the long time audience had remembered in September 1968, before Bill Bauer was supposedly killed off in an Alaskan plane crash in July 1969, that he was given only nine years to live post a heart transplant. Also it appeared to much of the audience that The <b>Dobsons</b> themselves seemed to lose interest in the coming back from the dead of Bill Bauer, when by May 1978, the character was gone out of story line, only to return for brief appearances in November 1978, April 1980, August 1983 (when the character was killed off) and November 1983 (in flashbacks of another character.) In early 1974, the theme of the show and its background music was changed from acoustic organ-based to orchestra-based. The version of the opening and closing themes, [...] "La Lumière," [...] by Charles Paul, first used in 1968 (and scored for piano and organ), was re-scored by Mr. Paul in an orchestral version, and the billboards and titles, were changed as well. See https://www.youtube.com/soapluvva#play/all/uploads-all/0/3es3Yk2O4Zc for some recordings of the piano-organ version and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2LlUzOH4fE&feature=PlayList&p=06A2C2BD4A35CCDF&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&index=31 for a recording of the orchestral version.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a list}} of {{passengers}} on the St. Michael of Scarborough which left Leith Tolbooth on 12 December 1678, and likely arrived in the Thames in December of that Year. It was compiled using sources from David <b>Dobsons</b> book regarding Scots Banished to the American Plantations, which makes reference to original sources from the Scottish Privy Council as well as others.|$|R
50|$|The {{encyclopedia}} was a reprint of {{the contemporary}} third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (published 1788-1797), although <b>Dobsons</b> Encyclopædia was a somewhat longer work in which a few articles were edited for a patriotic American audience. The term Britannica was dropped from the title, the dedication to King George III was replaced with a dedication to the readers, and sundry facts about American history, geography and peoples were added. Reproduction of printed pages was not then possible; the entire work was re-set in type, allowing changes to be made throughout. However, the work is largely a reprint of Britannica. The plates were re-engraved from the originals as accurately as possible, but some were changed. For example, the map of North America used in Britannicas third edition was the very out-of-date one used {{in the first and}} second editions; <b>Dobsons</b> used a larger and much more detailed and updated map, and a slightly improved map of South America.|$|R
5|$|When Byrd {{became the}} {{university}} president in 1935, Jack Faber replaced him {{as head coach}} and accumulated a 7–2–2 record. The following year, Frank <b>Dobson,</b> former Georgia Tech assistant coach under John Heisman, assumed the head coaching position. After a 6–5 first season, <b>Dobson</b> led the Terrapins to an 8–2 record in 1937. The highlight of the season was a 13–0 shutout of 17th-ranked Syracuse. In the homecoming game, Charlie Weidinger completed a pass to William Bryant for a 13–7 go-ahead over Florida. The Terrapins' two losses came against Penn and Penn State, the latter being the second game in a rivalry that would bedevil Maryland throughout its entire duration. At {{the end of the}} season, Maryland was declared the Southern Conference champions, the team's first major conference title.|$|E
5|$|By 1900 Bolton was Lancashire's {{third largest}} {{engineering}} centre after Manchester and Oldham. About 9,000 men {{were employed in}} the industry, half of them working for <b>Dobson</b> and Barlow in Kay Street. The firm made textile machinery. Another engineering company Hick, Hargreaves & Co based at the Soho Foundry made Lancashire boilers and heavy machinery. Thomas Ryder and Son of Turner Bridge manufactured machine tools for the international motor industry. Wrought iron was produced for more than 100 years at Thomas Walmsley and Sons' Atlas Forge.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time, Kneale used a {{character}} {{from a previous}} serial other than Quatermass himself, the journalist James Fullalove from The Quatermass Experiment. The production team had hoped that Paul Whitsun-Jones {{would be able to}} reprise the part; he was unavailable and Brian Worth was cast instead. Michael Ripper appeared as an army sergeant; he had been in Hammer Film Productions' adaptation of the second Quatermass serial, Quatermass 2, the previous year. The drama also featured future Dad's Army actress Nan Braunton as Miss <b>Dobson.</b>|$|E
50|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, Gentilhombre became a breeding stallion, beginning his stud career at <b>Dobsons</b> Stud at Fawley in Buckinghamshire at {{a fee of}} £1,500. He was later exported to Japan. The most successful of his offspring was probably Kitayama Zakura, a filly who won two Grade Three races, the Shinzan Kinen and Kyoto Yonsai Tokubetsu, in 1984. Gentilhombre died on 1 January 1992 in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Durable flagstones, Elland flags, were quarried {{near the}} town and after the canal was constructed, they could be transported {{economically}} all over the county. Elland housed the main factory of the manufacturer of Gannex products and {{is the home of}} the <b>Dobsons</b> sweet factory, which produces traditional boiled sweets. Since 2001, Elland has been home to Suma Wholefoods, the largest workers' co-operative in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Zaslow {{was unhappy}} with his earlier rape scenes with Rita, which he felt came across as a seduction. The <b>Dobsons</b> crafted a {{full-fledged}} marital rape (at the time this was not considered a crime) in a March 1979 episode involving Roger and Holly who had married in January 1979. This rape scene was a counterattack against rival network NBC's soap opera Another World, whose much ballyhooed expansion to 90-minute telecasts (complete {{with the death of}} a major character) happened that same day.|$|R
5|$|On September 2, 2016, James {{made her}} debut for Chikara, {{when she entered}} the 2016 King of Trios tournament as part of Team Original Divas Revolution, {{alongside}} Jazz and Victoria. They defeated Team Shimmer (Candice LeRae, Crazy Mary <b>Dobson</b> and Solo Darling) in their first round match. The following day, Team Original Divas Revolution was eliminated from the tournament by The Warriors Three (Oleg the Usurper, Princess KimberLee and ThunderFrog).|$|E
5|$|The Tudor era saw {{prominent}} {{artists as}} part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William <b>Dobson.</b> The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} with a quiet, {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because {{he said that he}} heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael <b>Dobson,</b> a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E

50|$|The route's northeastern {{terminus}} is in Second North River at Route 112, {{where is}} travels southwest along the North River before crossing it and entering Lewis Mountain. It continues through <b>Dobsons</b> Corner, Upper Ridge, and Hicksville, and it briefly merges with Route 885 in Havelock. The route then {{passes through a}} mostly wooded area as it arrives in Lower Ridge and crosses Route 2. It continues past Perry Settlement, Cosman Settlement, and Head of Millstream, Gibbon, Summerfield, Pleasent Ridge, and Centreville. It then follows the Millstream River to Berwick and Route 10. The route continues to Lower Millstream at the eastern terminus of Route 875 and ends {{in the community of}} Apohaqui at Route 121.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, the <b>Dobsons</b> {{were moved}} to As the World Turns, and were {{replaced}} by Douglas Marland. Marland had written for such veteran soap writers as Agnes Nixon and Irna Phillips (the creator of The Guiding Light) and had written on his own, as well as acted on As the World Turns in the early 1970s. From January 1980 to June 1982, Marland, as head writer, wanted to bring Guiding Light back to its roots and abide by the shows [...] "bible". To that end {{he came up with}} many new characters, but incorporated them gradually with veteran characters. He also added more levels of intrigue and crimes to the show. Marland focused on introducing characters younger than 25.|$|R
