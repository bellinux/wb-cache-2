40|$|Diagrams are ubiquitous; {{they are}} used to {{communicate}} ideas and are often used to model aspects of the real world. We teach with them and expect students to develop modelling skills using them. In conventional, paper-based assessment, we do not think twice about asking students to draw free-hand diagrams to express both their knowledge and drawing skills. In e-Assessment, the situation is very different. There is very little support for assessing diagramming skills and where students can <b>draw</b> <b>free-form</b> diagrams (with a drawing tool) the assessment has to be human. In this paper we discuss an approach to the automatic marking of a certain class of diagrams (almost graph-based) illustrating how we have incorporated domain knowledge, pedagogy and marking schemes into the process. In particular, the paper examines the general strategy for automatic marking based on meaningful units and how marking schemes are constructed. The paper concludes with the results of applying our method to a corpus of student diagrams and illustrates how the consistency afforded by automatic marking can overcome some of the deficiencies in human marking...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging {{has become}} a rou-tine modality for the determination of patient cardiac morphology. The extraction of this information can be important for the de-velopment of new clinical applications {{as well as the}} planning and guidance of cardiac interventional procedures. To avoid inter- and intra-observer variability of manual delineation, it is highly desir-able to develop an automatic technique for whole heart segmenta-tion of cardiac magnetic resonance images. However, automating this process is complicated by the limited quality of acquired im-ages and large shape variation of the heart between subjects. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic whole heart segmentation framework based on two new image registration algorithms: the lo-cally affine registration method (LARM) and the free-form defor-mations with adaptive control point status (ACPS FFDs). LARM provides the correspondence of anatomical substructures such as the four chambers and great vessels of the heart, while the reg-istration using ACPS FFDs refines the local details using a con-strained optimization scheme. We validated our proposed segmen-tation framework on 37 cardiac MR volumes on the end-diastolic phase, displaying a wide diversity of morphology and pathology, and achieved a mean accuracy of 2. 14 0. 63 mm (rms surface distance) and a maximal error of 4. 31 mm.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Escuela Politécnica Superior, Departamento de Tecnología Electrónica y de las Comunicaciones. Fecha de lectura: Febrero 2015 The {{proliferation of}} handheld {{devices such as}} smartphones and tablets brings a new scenario for biometric authentication, and in particular to automatic signature verification. Research on signature verification has been traditionally carried out using signatures acquired on digitizing tablets or Tablet-PCs. This PhD Thesis addresses the problem of user authentication on handled devices using handwritten signatures and graphical passwords based on free-form doodles, {{as well as the}} effects of biometric aging on signatures. The Thesis pretends to analyze: (i) which are the effects of mobile conditions on signature and doodle verification, (ii) which are the most distinctive features in mobile conditions, extracted from the pen or fingertip trajectory, (iii) how do different similarity computation (i. e. matching) algorithms behave with signatures and graphical passwords captured on mobile conditions, and (iv) what is the impact of aging on signature features and verification performance. Two novel datasets have been presented in this Thesis. A database containing <b>free-form</b> graphical passwords <b>drawn</b> with the fingertip on a smartphone is described. It is the first publicly available graphical password database to the extent of our knowledge. A dataset containing signatures from users captured over a period 15 months is also presented, aimed towards the study of biometric aging. State-of-the-art local and global matching algorithms are used, namely Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models, Dynamic Time Warping and distance-based classifiers. A large proportion of features presented in the research literature is considered in this Thesis. The experimental contribution of this Thesis is divided in three main topics: signature verification on handheld devices, the effects of aging on signature verification, and free-form graphical password-based authentication. First, regarding signature verification in mobile conditions, we use a database captured both on a handheld device and digitizing tablet in an office-like scenario. We analyze the discriminative power of both global and local features using discriminant analysis and feature selection techniques. The effects of the lack of pen-up trajectories on handheld devices (when the stylus tip is not in contact with the screen) are also studied. We then analyze the effects of biometric aging on the signature trait. Using three different matching algorithms, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and distance-based classifiers, the impact in verification performance is studied. We also study the effects of aging on individual users and individual signature features. Template update techniques are analyzed as a way of mitigating the negative impact of aging. Regarding graphical passwords, the DooDB graphical password database is first presented. A statistical analysis is performed comparing the database samples (free-form doodles and simplified signatures) with handwritten signatures. The sample variability (inter-user, intra-user and inter-session) is also analyzed, as well as the learning curve for each kind of trait. Benchmark results are also reported using state of the art classifiers. Graphical password verification is afterwards studied using features and matching algorithms from the signature verification state of the art. Feature selection is also performed and the resulting feature sets are analyzed. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. A thorough analysis of individual feature performance has been carried out, both for global and local features and on signatures acquired using pen tablets and handheld devices. We have found which individual features are the most robust and which have very low discriminative potential (pen inclination and pressure among others). It has been found that feature selection increases verification performance dramatically, from example from ERRs (Equal Error Rates) over 30 % using all available local features, in the case of handheld devices and skilled forgeries, to rates below 20 % after feature selection. We study the impact of the lack of trajectory information when the pen tip is not in contact with the acquisition device surface (which happens when touchscreens are used for signature acquisitions), and we have found that the lack of pen-up trajectories negatively affects verification performance. As an example, the EER for the local system increases from 9. 3 % to 12. 1 % against skilled forgeries when pen-up trajectories are not available. We study the effects of biometric aging on signature verification and study a number of ways to compensate the observed performance degradation. It is found that aging does not affect equally all the users in the database and that features related to signature dynamics are more degraded than static features. Comparing the performance using test signatures from the first months with the last months, a variable effect of aging on the EER against random forgeries is observed in the three systems that are evaluated, from 0. 0 % to 0. 5 % in the DTW system, from 1. 0 % to 5. 0 % in the distance-based system using global features, and from 3. 2 % to 27. 8 % in the HMM system. A new graphical password database has been acquired and made publicly available. Verification algorithms for finger-drawn graphical passwords and simplified signatures are compared and feature analysis is performed. We have found that inter-session variability has a highly negative impact on verification performance, but this can be mitigated performing feature selection and applying fusion of different matchers. It has also been found that some feature types are prevalent in the optimal feature vectors and that classifiers have a very different behavior against skilled and random forgeries. An EER of 3. 4 % and 22. 1 % against random and skilled forgeries is obtained for free-form doodles, which is a promising performance...|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of tablet PCs and multi-touch computers, collaborative input on a single sketched surface {{is becoming more and}} more prevalent. The ability to identify which user draws a specific stroke on a shared surface is widely useful in a) security/forensics research, by effectively identifying a forgery, b) sketch recognition, by providing the ability to employ user-dependent recognition algorithms on a multi-user system, and c) multi-user collaborative systems, by effectively discriminating whose stroke is whose in a complicated diagram. To ensure an adaptive user interface, we cannot expect nor require that users will self-identify nor restrict themselves to a single pen. Instead, we prefer a system that can automatically determine a stroke’s owner, even when strokes by different users are drawn with the same pen, in close proximity, and near in timing. We present the results of an experiment that shows that the creator of an individual pen strokes can be determined with high accuracy, without supra-stroke context (such as timing, pen-ID, nor location), and based solely on the physical mechanics of how these strokes are drawn (specifically, pen tilt, pressure, and speed). Results from <b>free-form</b> <b>drawing</b> data, including text and doodles, but not signature data, show that our methods differentiate a single stroke (such as that of a dot of an ‘i’) between two users at an accuracy of 97. 5 % and between ten users at an accuracy o...|$|E
