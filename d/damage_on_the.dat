The United States Army Air Forces attacked by day, while RAF Bomber Command operated by night.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced {{in the course}} of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable <b>damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the <b>damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German ships. It is possible that the mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this be the case, the bombers achieved far more damage than the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the <b>damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E

Measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale, it also shook {{the islands of}} Pico and Faial, and resulted from a strike slip fracture, typical of other historical Azorean earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‑hour total was 26.8inches (680mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, {{the capital city}} of Fort-de-France reported 13.4in (341mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24hours; about 1inch (26mm) fell in 5minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02inches (153mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67mph (108km/h), with gusts reaching 99mph (160km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186homes and left 700people homeless.

5|$|There were no {{casualties}} as {{a result}} of Xavier. In the Solomon Islands, communications to the Temotu province were lost. When communications were restored on October 24, it was reported that there was only minor tree <b>damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands of Utupua and Vanikolo. On Tikopia, crops sustained damage, though the effects were considered light given the circumstances. Strong and gusty winds, rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern Vanuatuan islands, however, no significant damage was reported within the islands.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon watch {{was issued}} for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 14, which was {{upgraded}} to a typhoon warning the next day. Because Paka was intensifying while passing {{to the south}} of Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second wind from the southeast. Sustained winds on the island reached 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching 185km/h (115mph). Many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, Paka dropped 250–300mm (10–12in) of rain. <b>Damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island totaled $4.4million (1997USD, $6.4million 2015USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict <b>damage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E
5|$|One last Allied {{effort was}} made by 70 B-24 Liberators, which bombed airfields around Bari in Italy. Some 54 German {{aircraft}} were destroyed and 13 <b>damaged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The USAAF units claimed 50.|$|R
