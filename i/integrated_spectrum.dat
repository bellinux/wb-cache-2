40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>spectra</b> {{have been}} {{obtained}} of 31 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MC) and of 4 Galactic globular clusters. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500 [...] 4700 Angstroms at a resolution of 3. 2 Angstroms FWHM. The MC clusters primarily cover the age range < 10 ^ 8 [...] 3 Gyr, and hence are well-suited to an empirical study of aging post-starburst stellar populations. An age-dating method is presented that relies on two spectral absorption feature indices, Hdelta/Fe I 4045 and Ca II, {{as well as an}} index measuring the strength of the Balmer discontinuity. We compare the behavior of the spectral indices in the observed <b>integrated</b> <b>spectra</b> of the MC clusters to that of indices generated from theoretical evolutionary synthesis models of varying age and metal-abundance. The synthesis models are based on those of Worthey (1994, ApJS, 95, 107), when coupled with the combination of an empirical library of stellar spectra (Jones 1999, PhD thesis, University of North Carolina) for the cooler stars and synthetic spectra, generated from Kurucz model atmospheres, for the hotters stars.

40|$|Context. We {{carry out}} a {{detailed}} 2 D study of the ionised gas in the local universe galaxy UGC 9837. In nearby galaxies, like the galaxy in question here, the spatial distribution of the physical properties can be studied in detail, providing benchmarks for galaxy formation models. Aims. Our aim is to derive detailed and spatially resolved physical properties of the ionised gas of UGC 9837. In addition, we derive an <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the galaxy and study how varying spatial coverage affects the derived integrated properties. We also study how the same properties would be seen if the galaxy was placed at a higher redshift and observed as {{part of one of}} the high-z surveys. Methods. UGC 9837 was observed using the PMAS PPAK integral field unit. The spectra are reduced and calibrated and the stellar and ionised components separated. Using strong emission line ratios of the ionised gas, the source of ionisation, the dust extinction, the star formation rate, the electron density and the oxygen abundance derived from a total <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum,</b> central <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> and individual fibre spectra are studied. Finally, the same properties are studied in a spectrum whose spatial resolution is degraded to simulate high-z observations. Results. The spatial distribution of the ionised gas properties is consistent with inside-out growing scenario of galaxies. We also find that lack of spatial coverage would bias the results derived from the <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> leading, e. g., to an under-estimation of ionisation and over-estimation of metallicity, if only the centre of the galaxy was covered by the spectrum. Our simulation of high-z observations shows that part of the spatial information, such as dust and SFR distribution would be lost while shallower gradients in metallicity and ionisation strength would be detected.

40|$|The {{galaxy cluster}} Abell 2256 hosts {{one of the}} most {{intriguing}} examples in the class of radio relics. It has been found that this radio relic has a rather flat <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> at low frequencies that would imply an injection spectral index for the electrons that is inconsistent with the flattest allowed by the test particle diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We performed new high-frequency observations at 2273, 2640, and 4850 MHz. Combining these new observations with images available in the literature, we constrain the radio <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the radio relic in Abell 2256 over the widest sampled frequency range collected so far for this class of objects (63 - 10450 MHz). Moreover, we used X-ray observations of the cluster to check the temperature structure in the regions around the radio relic. We find that the relic keeps an unusually flat behavior up to high frequencies. Although the relic <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> between 63 and 10450 MHz is not inconsistent with a single power law with α_ 63 ^ 10450 = 0. 92 ± 0. 02, we find hints of a steepening at frequencies > 1400 MHz. The two frequency ranges 63 - 1369 MHz and 1369 - 10450 MHz are, indeed, best represented by two different power laws, with α_ 63 ^ 1369 = 0. 85 ± 0. 01 and α_ 1369 ^ 10450 = 1. 00 ± 0. 02. This broken power law would require special conditions to be explained in terms of test-particle DSA, e. g., non-stationarity of the spectrum and/or non-stationarity of the shock. On the other hand, the single power law would make of this relic the one with the flattest <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> known so far, even flatter than what allowed in the test-particle approach to DSA. We find a rather low temperature ratio of T_ 2 /T_ 1 ∼ 1. 7 across the G region of the radio relic and no temperature jump across the H region. Comment: 18 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables.

40|$|We present spectroscopic and {{photometric}} {{results for}} the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) cluster Bruck 88. From the comparison of the cluster <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> with template cluster spectra {{we found that the}} Milky Way globular cluster template spectra are the ones which best resemble it. However, the extracted cluster colour magnitude diagram reveals that Bruck 88 is a young cluster (log(t) = 8. 1 +- 0. 1). The derived cluster age is compatible with the presence of a Bright Red Giant (BRG) star located ~ 2. 6 arcsec in the sky from the cluster centre. We serendipitously observed HW 33, a star cluster located ~ 3 arcmin to the south-east from Bruck 88. We obtained for the cluster the same age than Bruck 88 and surprisingly, a BRG star located within the cluster radius also appears to be compatible with the cluster age. We estimated the MK type of the BRG star in the Bruck 88 field to be in the range G 9 II/Ib - K 1 III. By combining the spectrum of a star within this MK type range with a 100 - 150 Myr template cluster <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum,</b> we found that a proportion 85 / 15 in the sense BRG/template results in a spectrum which best resembles that of Bruck 88.

40|$|We {{construct}} an <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the intermediate age, solar metallicity Galactic cluster M 67, from individual spectra of cluster members. The <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{is used as}} a template to test our stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, in an age and [Fe/H] regime where such models remain largely untested. We show that our models predict a spectroscopic age of 3. 5 +/- 0. 5 Gyr for M 67, in excellent agreement with the age we derive from the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster. The same age is obtained when using Hbeta, Hgamma or Hdelta as the age indicator. Our models predict the abundances of Fe, Mg, C and N in agreement with detailed abundance analyses of cluster stars, to within 0. 1 dex. Encouraged by the high degree of consistency of our models, we apply them {{to the study of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the central 3 arcsec of the compact elliptical galaxy M 32. The resulting luminosity-weighted age of the galaxy ranges between 2 and 3. 5 Gyr, depending on the Balmer line used. According to our models, the center of M 32 seems to have a super-solar light-weighted Fe abundance, ranging between [Fe/H] ~ + 0. 1 and + 0. 3, depending on the Fe line adopted. Light-weighted abundance ratios found for the center of M 32 are as follows: [Mg/Fe] ~ - 0. 1 [...] - 0. 2, [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] ~ 0. We find that single SPS models with a solar-scaled abundance pattern cannot fit all the Balmer and metal lines in the <b>integrated</b> <b>spectrum</b> of M 32. There is a systematic trend in the sense that bluer absorption lines indicate a younger age and a higher [Fe/H]. This slight inconsistency can be due either to (unaccounted for) abundance ratio effects on blue iron and Balmer line indices, or to a spread of the ages of the stellar populations in M 32. Current stellar population models cannot break this degeneracy at the level of accuracy required to address this problem. Comment: 49 Pages, including 9 figures and 6 tables.

Our results show no significant correlation between spiral host galaxy metallicity and SNIa light curve decline rate. The Hα equivalent width (EW) of the host galaxy is an indicator the current star-formation rate compared to average rate in the past.

We have measured Ca abundances from the Ca I 4227 feature both by using the Lick Ca 4227 index and also by defining a new index, Ca 4227 _r, that avoids the CN 4216 molecular band in the continuum on the blueward side of the line. With the new index definition we measure Ca abundances that are systematically ~ 0. 3 dex higher than with the Lick Ca 4227 index. The result is that with the new index definition we obtain higher [Ca/Fe] abundances in early-type galaxies which are more consistent with their well known [Mg/Fe] over-abundances. Hence, we suggest that Ca might be slightly enhanced, relative to Fe, in early-type galaxies. Comment: 25 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
