5000|$|Throughout 1986, Estocin {{served as}} the Navy's testbed for the Mk-92 <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> System <b>improvement</b> project (CORT). The Mk-92 [...] "CORT" [...] program was a CNO Priority-1 Project, {{one of the only}} four in the entire Navy at that time. These tests had Estocin {{tracking}} and engaging a variety of surface and air targets. Fifteen SM-1 medium range missiles and nearly 1000 rounds of 76mm ammunition were fired {{in the course of the}} test cycle. By the end of 1986, Estocin had logged nearly 15,000 underway miles in support of this project. Estocin and her crew were awarded a Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation for operations between January and November, 1986.|$|R

50|$|The Mark 92 <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> System is a US-built medium-range {{anti-aircraft}} {{missile and}} gun <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system.

40|$|Abstract. Anti-aircraft gun <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> {{networking}} {{can improve}} the whole battle efficiency of anti-aircraft gun fire system. Aiming at the data processing need of <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> network, a gun <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> network track fusion system is designed. The system is realized by C programming language, which {{can be applied to}} the <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> computer. The flow diagram of the track fusion system is given.

500|$|The early {{main battery}} <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> {{consisted}} of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Tower, two Mark 38 Gun <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Systems (GFCS), [...] and <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> equipment located {{in two of the}} three turrets. As modernized in the 1980s, each turret carried a DR-810 radar that measured the muzzle velocity of each gun, which made it easier to predict the velocity of succeeding shots. Together with the Mark 160 FCS and better propellant consistency, the improvements created the most accurate battleship-caliber guns ever made.|$|R

50|$|The Baltimore {{class was}} {{equipped}} {{from the start}} with electronic <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> systems to determine the fire-parameters by which targets over the horizon could be hit. The main guns were controlled by a Mark 34 <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system connected to an MK 8 radar. The anti-aircraft guns were guided by Mk 37 systems with Mk-4 radar. Later, the <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> radars were replaced along with the main radar systems. The <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> systems remained the same except that the new 3 in guns were fitted upgraded to Mk 56 with Mk 35 radars.|$|R

50|$|Site 131-1A had {{electric}} lights, phones, {{and radio}} communications, {{and a time}} interval bell that was used for coordinating <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> information.

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} {{difference in the}} Richelieu and Dunkerque profiles was the mounting of the <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> director system aft, {{on a kind of}} mack, so that the funnel opening came out obliquely aft underneath the control tower. Otherwise, Richelieus <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system was very similar to Dunkerques. All the <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> systems were airtight and fitted with light steel plating against the machine gun attacks of strafing aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{development}} {{regarding the}} main armament was {{the adoption of}} a combined high-angle/low-angle director tower, the HA/LA Mk.IV (TP). This was never entirely satisfactory in the HA mode, and was at least a ton overweight. It was later reworked, somewhat unsuccessfully again, as the Mk.I [...] "K tower" [...] of the Z class. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA <b>Fire</b> <b>Control</b> Computer. Despite its problems, the L and M class' director tower and its Type 285 radar provided better high-angle <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> than any similar Axis destroyer, the vast majority of which did not have any high-angle <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system, much less a dedicated AA <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> radar.|$|R
5000|$|The TDC {{needed to}} be {{positioned}} near other <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> equipment to minimize the amount of electromechanical interconnect. Because submarine space within the pressure hull was limited, the TDC {{needed to be}} as small as possible. On World War II submarines, the TDC and other <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> equipment was mounted in the conning tower, which was a very small space.The packaging problem was severe {{and the performance of}} some early torpedo <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> equipment was hampered by the need to make it small.

50|$|During {{their long}} service life, rangekeepers were updated often as {{technology}} advanced, and by World War II {{they were a}} critical part of an integrated <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system. The incorporation of radar into the <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system early in World War II provided ships the ability to conduct effective gunfire operations at long range in poor weather and at night.

5000|$|The main {{armament}} was {{a single}} powered Emerlec EX 34 Mod 0 turret with two 30mm cannons mounted forward of the main superstructure. The weapon system linked to an Elsag NA10 Mod 0 <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> system and Orion 10X <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> radar. Four [...]50 caliber and two 7.62mm machine guns complimented this system.
