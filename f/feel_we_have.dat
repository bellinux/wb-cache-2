[...] However, Warner Bros. did concede that they never pursued or received formal release from the White House for the use of Clinton's image. While the Counsel commented that parody and satire are protected under the First Amendment, press secretary Mike McCurry believed that [...] "there is a difference when the President's image, which is his alone to control, is used {{in a way that would}} lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didn't say." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Australia's {{ruthless}} on-field {{dominance and}} {{a succession of}} one-sided victories, the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest. Bradman's dominant cricketing stature was {{a key factor in}} his team's popularity with the public, especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign. A leading cricket writer of the time, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, said [...] "we want him to do well. We <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman." [...] The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that [...] "cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers." [...] Writing later, Haigh opined that [...] "perhaps no touring cricketer... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer". Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin. Of Bradman's retirement, Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "...a miracle has been removed from among us... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradman's {{dominant}} cricketing stature {{was also}} a key platform of his team's popularity with the public. The leading English writer R. C.

[...] Haigh opined that [...] "perhaps no touring cricketer... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer".

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "all that I {{objected to}} was this over-glorification of the feats of arms {{accomplished}} by us. People over here did not understand. On {{the one side}} were the great armies of Russia,--men drawn, all of them, {{from the ranks of}} the peasant, men of low nerve force, men who were not many degrees better than animals. They came to fight against us because it was their business to fight, because for fighting they drew their scanty pay, their food, and their drink, and the clothes they wore. They fought because if they refused they faced the revolver bullets of their officers,--men like themselves, who also fought because it was their profession, because it was in the traditions of their family, but who would, I think, have very much preferred disporting themselves in the dancing halls of their cities, drinking champagne with the ladies of their choice, or gambling with cards. I do not say that these were not brave men, all of them. I myself saw them face death by the hundreds, but the lust of battle was in their veins then, the taste of blood upon their palates. We do not claim to be called world conquerors because we overcame these men. If one could have seen into the hearts of our own soldiers as they marched into battle, and seen also into the hearts of those others who lay there sullenly waiting, one would not have wondered then. There was, indeed, nothing to wonder at. What we cannot make you understand over here is that every Japanese soldier who crept across the bare plains or lay stretched in the trenches, who loaded his rifle and shot and killed and waited for death,--every man felt something beating in his heart which those others did not <b>feel.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> no great army, Mr. Haviland, but {{what we have is a}} great nation who have things beating in their heart the knowledge of which seems somehow to have grown cold amongst you Western people. The boy is born with it; it is there in his very soul, as dear to him as the little home where he lives, the blossoming trees under which he plays. It leads him to the rifle and the drill ground as naturally as the boys of your country turn to the cricket fields and the football ground. Over here you call that spirit patriotism. It was something which beat in the heart of every one of those hundreds of thousands of men, something which kept their eyes clear and bright as they marched into battle, which made them look Death itself in the face, and fight even while the blackness crept over them. You see, your own people have so many interests, so many excitements, so much to distract. With us it is not so. In the heart of the Japanese comes the love of his parents, the love of his wife and children, and, deepest, perhaps, of all the emotions he knows, the strong magnificent background to his life, the love of the country which bore him, which shelters them. It is for his home he fights, for his simple joys amongst those who are dear to him, for the great mysterious love of the Motherland. Forgive me if I have expressed myself badly, have repeated myself often. It is a matter which I find it so hard to talk about, so hard here to make you understand." ...|$|E
