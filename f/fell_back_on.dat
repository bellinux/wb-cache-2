5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers. The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped {{from as far away as}} Aberdeen, had cost £50,000 in 1655, when it was still unfinished. Inverlocky had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E

5|$|That {{night the}} North Koreans {{launched}} a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> G Company south of the pass. The North Koreans captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then overran a section of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|E

5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

60|$|The crowd {{regarded}} him wild-eyed. Fresh members came running up, and {{pushing for a}} front place <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> hastily <b>on</b> the main body and watched breathlessly. Mr. Blows, disquieted by their silence, renewed his protestations.|$|R

25|$|The Luftwaffe {{struck in}} the late morning to soften the enemy defences. The 3rd Pz. Div. {{advanced}} on Thorembais. The 4th Panzer was to move in parallel on Perwez, against an expected strong Belgian anti-tank line. XVI Army Corps thus <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the 6th Army's instruction to push immediately on Gembloux.|$|E
25|$|For two days, Jackson {{maintained}} his position south of Cedar Run {{on the western}} slope of the mountain, waiting for a Federal attack that did not come. Finally, receiving news that all of Pope's army had arrived at Culpeper Court House, on August 12, Jackson <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Gordonsville to a more defensive position behind the Rapidan River.|$|E
25|$|Moving to Leningrad, Vladimir Tsyganko also <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his {{professional}} career. He served as deputy technical {{director of the}} State Institute for the Design of Metallurgical Plants, and was then head of the technical control department of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. Nevertheless, in 1937 he was singled out as a political suspect by the Stalinist regime, {{at the height of}} the Great Purge. Arrested on November 29, he was sentenced to death on December 2 and executed shortly after, in January 1938.|$|E

25|$|City {{governments in}} 1930–31 tried {{to meet the}} {{depression}} by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief. They <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up. After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.|$|E
25|$|Historian James R. Arnold {{offers a}} {{different}} narrative. He writes that Pfanzelter's command was withdrawn on the III Armeekorps commander Hohenzollern's orders, leaving the north-south road through Bachl wide open. Meanwhile, Thierry's attached dragoons discovered that Abensberg and its nearby roads were alive with moving columns of enemy troops. Around 8:00 AM, Thierry <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Bachl {{and found to}} his dismay that French cavalry already occupied the village. Having become separated from his supporting dragoons, Thierry's men were chased into the woods by Jacquinot's horsemen. From there the Austrians hiked cross-country toward Rohr.|$|E
25|$|On 4 May, Vandamme and his VIII Corps reached Linz. He found General-major Joseph von Richter and an Austrian landwehr brigade {{opposite}} Linz on the Danube's north bank. Earlier in the campaign, {{this unit}} had {{assisted in the}} blockade of the Bavarian garrison of Passau. After Passau was relieved, Richter <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the north bank to Linz. Aggressively, Vandamme lined up his artillery on the south bank and began to bombard Richter's men. Under cover of the cannonading, the Württembergers crossed over in boats and attacked. Richter's poorly trained landwehr were overrun and most were captured.|$|E
25|$|The Russian 5th and 7th Divisions retired {{towards the}} main body of the army at Różan. Bennigsen's forces <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to Nowogród <b>on</b> the River Narew, uniting on 1 January 1807 with the forces under Buxhoeveden.|$|R

25|$|Within {{two weeks}} Kutuzov {{decided to give}} major battle on the {{approaches}} to Moscow. He withdrew the troops still further to the east, deploying them for the upcoming battle. Two huge armies clashed near Borodino on 7 September 1812 {{in what has been}} described as the greatest battle in human history up to that date, involving nearly {{a quarter of a million}} soldiers. The result of the battle was inconclusive, with near a third of both the French and the Russian army killed or wounded. After a conference at the village of Fili, Kutuzov <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the strategy of his predecessor: withdraw in order to preserve the Russian army as long as possible.|$|E
25|$|At 03:04 in {{the morning}} of 19 July Furious was ready to fly off her Camels when a {{thunderstorm}} struck. Rather than cancel the operation, it was decided to delay it twenty-four hours and Furious and her destroyer screen <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Force B. The combined squadron cruised out of sight off the Danish coast until the morning of 19 July, and in worsening weather conditions Furious flew off her Camels between 03:13 and 03:21. The first flight consisted of Jackson, Dickson and Williams; the second of Smart, Dawson, Yeulett and Thyne. Thyne was forced to turn around with engine trouble before reaching the target and ditched his aircraft before being recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the oil {{industry}} in Oklahoma began a rapid decline and Keith soon found himself unemployed. He <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his football training and played defensive end with the semi-pro Oklahoma City Drillers while continuing to perform with his band. (The Drillers were an unofficial farm club of the United States Football League's Oklahoma Outlaws; Keith tried out for the Outlaws but {{did not make the}} team.) He then returned to focus once again on music. His family and friends were doubtful he would succeed, but, in 1984, Easy Money (various other band members included Mike Barnes, T.A. Brauer, and David Saylors) began playing the honky tonk circuit in Oklahoma and Texas.|$|E
60|$|At the signal, the two steeds tore up {{the ground}} like whirlwinds; the two knights, two {{flashing}} perpendicular masses of steel, rapidly converged; the two lances met upon the two shields of either, and shivered, splintered, shattered into ten hundred thousand pieces, which whirled through the air here and there, among the rocks, or in the trees, or in the river. The two horses <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> trembling <b>on</b> their haunches, where they remained for half a minute or so.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{will never}} do," [...] she exclaimed, once again standing. [...] "As God hears me now I will never say it. It would be wrong,--and I will never say it." [...] In thus protesting she put forth her little hands clenched fast, {{and then came}} again the flush across her brow, and {{her eyes for a}} moment seemed to wander, and then, failing in {{strength}} to carry her through it all, she <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> senseless <b>on</b> the sofa.|$|R
25|$|Broussier {{raised the}} {{blockade}} of the citadel on the 24th and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> toward Marmont. <b>On</b> 25 June, Gyulai resupplied the garrison of the castle. That day, Broussier sent two battalions of the 84th Line Infantry Regiment into Graz. The column was without {{support from the}} rest of his division.|$|R
25|$|On 9 October, Lecoq and Hagken began {{advancing}} west {{in separate}} columns. The march {{was slow and}} on 19 October, the Prussians received news of the catastrophe of Jena-Auerstedt. Lecoq and Hagken immediately <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Hamelin, arriving on 23 October. From there, Lecoq set out the next day for the Elbe. Hearing a report that French forces already blocked his path, he halted his march on the 27th and returned to Hamelin where he began acquiring food and supplies to sustain a siege. He sent Oberst (Colonel) Christian Friedrich von der Osten with one dragoon regiment and one infantry battalion across the Elbe, where he joined a part of Blücher's command.|$|E
25|$|Florescu had {{significant}} {{success as a}} self-proclaimed irredentist, agitating for Romanian causes in disputed Bukovina and Transylvania. Ultimately, however, he failed in his bid to rise through the National Liberal Party, as the latter moved to the center, and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> independent journalism, founding several periodicals of his own. He had a long but interrupted collaboration with another dissident liberal and poet, Alexandru Macedonski, who co-opted him on his Literatorul editing team during the 1880s. A precursor, but not an affiliate, of the Romanian Symbolist movement, Florescu had steadier friendships with the younger Symbolists Mircea Demetriade and Iuliu Cezar Săvescu. His main contribution to pre-Symbolist belles-lettres is prose poetry {{in the manner of}} Catulle Mendès.|$|E
25|$|Antipas was not Herod's {{first choice}} of heir. That honor fell to Aristobulus and Alexander, Herod's sons by the Hasmonean princess Mariamne. It {{was only after}} they were {{executed}} (c. 7 BC), and Herod's oldest son Antipater was convicted of trying to poison his father (5 BC), that the now elderly Herod <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his youngest son Antipas, revising his will to make him heir. During his fatal illness in 4 BC, Herod had yet another change of heart about the succession. According to {{the final version of}} his will, Antipas' elder brother Archelaus was now to become king of Judea, Idumea and Samaria, while Antipas would rule Galilee and Perea with the lesser title of tetrarch. Philip was to receive Gaulanitis (the Golan Heights), Batanaea (southern Syria), Trachonitis and Auranitis (Hauran).|$|E
50|$|The battle had {{severely}} damaged {{the morale of}} the Neapolitan troops and many senior officers had been casualties in the battle. The battered Neapolitan army <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> in disarray. <b>On</b> 5 May, a joint Anglo-Austrian fleet began a blockade of Ancona, eventually taking the entire garrison of the city as prisoners.|$|R
6000|$|Finow's son {{was evidently}} {{made for a}} {{theological}} disputant, and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> at once <b>on</b> the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence was lacking.

The fall of Little Rock sealed Arkansas' fate and helped to further demoralize Confederate citizens west of the Mississippi River.|$|R
