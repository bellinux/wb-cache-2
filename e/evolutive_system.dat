40|$|AbstractThin tubular {{parts are}} often subject to turning process during manufacturing. The {{increasing}} compliance of the workpiece, which is associated to tool displacement and to matter removal, can {{give rise to}} chatter, leading to poor surface quality or premature machine/tool damage. The present work addresses an experimental case of turning a steel thin-walled tube featuring intense vibrations with variable parameters. Observations of transient records during the pass suggest a strong influence of the matter removal on the eigenfrequencies of the system, while the tool's motion implies strong variation of the modal projection of the cutting force. Another characteristic phenomenon is the intermittency of the vibrations and discontinuous chatter frequency evolution. These phenomena are reproduced and analyzed numerically. By means of a finite element modeling, the part's geometry variation during the pass is taken into account.

We make the hypothesis that speciation events play a central role for feedback formation and, and in order to select the negative cycles, the arising species need to be strongly connected to the environment, therefore the speciation needs to be sympatric (a speciation mode where new species arise without geographical isolation). As an intermediate result, we propose a simulative model of sympatric speciation and apply it to the ﬁeld of evolutive algorithms. We propose some variations of the standard island model, a model used in evolutive algorithms to evolve multiple populations, to obtain dynamics similar to the sympatric speciation model, enhancing the diversity and the stability of the <b>evolutive</b> <b>system.</b> Then we propose a technique to deﬁne a metric and calculate approximated distances on very complex genetic spaces (a recurring problem for several evolutionary algorithms approaches).

Our objective was to assess its medium term follow-up results {{as well as its}} complications. METHODS: 21 patients (mean age of 57. 6 years) were operated by a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), using the AES implant, according to the standard technique. Only 18 patients were included. The other three patients were excluded from the study: two had been revised for avascular talar necrosis and one patient was happy with her outcome but could not present for logistic reasons at the last follow-up. Indications for surgery included posttraumatic osteoarthritis, primary osteoarthritis, hemochromatosis, rheumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis as a sequel of ankle instability. All patients were analyzed clinically and radiologically. Special attention was given to the presence or not of areas of osteolysis around the implants as well on conventional radiography as on CT-scan imaging, according to a specific protocol. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 39. 4 months. Average American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score improved from 52. 2 preoperatively to 86. 6 postoperatively. No intra-operative complications or early complications have been noted. Delayed complications were the following: one valgus malalignment, one recurrent painful anterior heterotrophic bone formation. Above all, we noted on conventional X-ray the presence of osteolysis in 77 % (14) of our patients, with a size of 0. 5 - 1 cm or greater on conventional X-ray. The most vulnerable area seemed to be the posterior tibial plafond. The four remaining patients did not show any cyst formation on X-ray but did also, just as the other 14 patients, on the CT-scan. CT-scan, on the contrary, found more osteolysis {{in the body of the}} talus, underneath the implant, an area masked on conventional X-ray. Only one patient was revised with allograft bone filling of a symptomatic osteolysis, without the need for implant removal. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study shows a high frequency of delayed appearance of osteolysis (77 %) in 18 AES total ankle arthroplasties.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to advance an {{extensible}} theory of living systems using an approach to biomathematics and biocomputation that suitably addresses self-organized, self-referential and anticipatory systems with multi-temporal multi-agents. Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling of emergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their sustentative processes in artificial and natural life systems. Main applications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology and astrobiology, as well as robotics, industrial automation and man-machine interface. Since 2011 over 100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial set of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as Integral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a situation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale dynamic category theory, Memory <b>Evolutive</b> <b>Systems</b> (MES), hence WLIMES.

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{preceding}} papers, the authors have developed the theory of Memory <b>Evolutive</b> <b>Systems</b> which represents a mathematical model (based on Category theory) for natural open self-organizing systems, such as biological, sociological or neural systems. In these systems, the dynamics is modulated by the cooperative or/and competitive interactions between the global system and a net of internal more or less specialized Centers of Regulation (CR) with a differential access to a central hierarchical Memory. Each CR operates at its own complexity level and time-scale, but their strategies are competitive, whence a 'dialectics between heterogeneous CRs {{which is at the}} root of higher order cognition. The problem tackled in the present paper is the emergence of a Semantics in the MES modeling a cognitive system; it relies on the detection of specific invariances by the CRs that leads to classify objects according to their main attributes, and form new formal units representing their invariance classes. The idea is that a (lower) CR, say E, classifies two objects B and C as having 'the same shape' if they activate the same pattern of its actors; however this classification remains implicit for E itself and it can be apprehended only by a higher Ievel CR which may memorize the invariance class by a higher object, called a 'E-concept'. The concepts with respect to the various CRs form the semantic memory which gives more flexibility in the evaluation, selection and memorization of appropriate strategies, as well as in internal or external communications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we present the {{approximation}} of an infinite horizon optimal control {{problem for the}} <b>evolutive</b> Navier-Stokes <b>system.</b> The method {{is based on a}} model reduction technique, using a POD approximation, coupled with a Hamilton-Jacobi equation which characterizes the value function of the corresponding control problem for the reduced system. Although the approximation schemes available for the HJB are shown to be convergent for any dimension, in practice we need to restrict the dimension to rather small numbers and this limitation affects the accuracy of the POD approximation. We will present numerical tests for the control of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes system in two-dimensional spatial domains to illustrate our approach and to show the effectiveness of the method...|$|R
