5|$|The Valley Ho competed {{favorably with}} the Safari Hotel, erected {{about the same}} time east of Scottsdale Fashion Square. Both hotels offered premium hospitality, and helped Scottsdale expand its public image. With the Valley Ho an {{immediate}} financial success, in 1958 Varney designed and built two more wings of guest rooms to the northwest of the original complex. The same materials and style were employed on the expansion buildings, but instead of single exterior corridors with rooms to one side, the added wings loaded central corridors with rooms on both sides. Another Scottsdale landmark hotel, the Mountain Shadows Resort, opened the following year, in 1959. These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> Scottsdale.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{government}} also invited foreign architects to both work in Japan and teach new Japanese architects. One of these, the British architect Josiah Conder {{went on to}} train {{many of the most}} prominent of the Japanese Meiji era architects, including Kingo Tatsuno, Tatsuzō Sone and Tokuma Katayama. Tatsuno's early works had a Venetian style influenced by John Ruskin, but his later works such as the Bank of Japan (1896) and Tōkyō Station (1914) have a more Beaux-Arts <b>feel.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, Katayama was more influenced by the French Second Empire style which {{can be seen in the}} Nara National Museum (1894) and the Kyōto National Museum (1895).|$|E
25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E

25|$|As a humanist public school, Westminster {{maintained}} a curriculum which trained pupils {{in the art}} of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue. This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking, as much of it displays these dialectical patterns. The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Dryden's capacity for assimilation. This was also to be exhibited in his later works. His years at Westminster were not uneventful, and his first published poem, an elegy with a strong royalist <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> the death of his schoolmate Henry, Lord Hastings from smallpox, alludes to the execution of King Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649, very near the school where Dr. Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E

Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints {{it would have been}} easier to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, but he did not want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rob LeDonne, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons explained {{the inspiration for the}} song: [...] "Well, the thing we learned after touring with Doo Wops was how it is we like to <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> stage when performing. We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't really get {{to do a lot of}} that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare to}} write the script, Walker watched various movies {{featuring}} gangsters. He attempted to take what he could from The Untouchables, especially Robert De Niro's portrayal of Al Capone. Walker watched movies created and set in the 1930s, including {{but not limited to}} The Public Enemy, [...] Little Caesar, Once Upon a Time in America, [...] Miller's Crossing and various movies starring James Cagney, because he believed they would give him a truer <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> how people of the era sounded and talked. He wanted to capture the lingo and rhythm. Because Baccano! is a [...] "stylized gangster flick" [...] and {{because of the nature of}} anime, he made the dialogue [...] more flowery and lingo-ridden than it would have been in reality.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] {{consists}} of no chorus, but six verses, varied {{by a handful}} of chords and Dylan's vocal emphasis. Keyboards, drums and vocals provide texture, while Mike Bloomfield plays Latin Americanesque fills on electric guitar. The keyboard parts in particular make innovative use of two different pianos, with Al Kooper playing an electric Hohner Pianet and Paul Griffin adding a bar room <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> tack piano. In all but the final verse, the even lines rhyme and the odd lines are unrhymed. In the final verse, however, the odd numbered lines rhyme on [...] "ee" [...] and all the even lines rhyme on [...] "uf."

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

2500|$|Almost all Draka {{citizens}} own {{at least}} a few slaves. The Draka are heavily outnumbered, meaning that a slave rebellion is a constant threat. In response, the Draka are utterly ruthless in their discipline of serfs. Impalement is the favored Draka method of executing rebellious serfs. Nonetheless, many Draka, especially those who are central characters in the novels, aim to create an idealized, [...] "rural community under a lord" [...] <b>feel</b> <b>on</b> their lands. Most Draka are quite fond of several of their serfs, as a European or American might have a favorite horse. Such an idealistic image is often spoiled, however, when punishment — always severe — has to be enacted. Killing a serf is never a crime, though it is a possible tort when the serf is the property of another Draka.|$|E
