500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{views the}} song as {{reflecting}} {{the effects of}} Harrison's search for increased awareness, in that [...] "the faster and more wide-reaching his thoughts came, the greater the struggle to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to express them". As reproduced in I, Me, Mine, Harrison's original lyrics were more direct and personal, compared with the philosophical focus of the completed song. The latter has nevertheless invited interpretation as a standard love song, in which the singer is cautiously entering into a romance. Another interpretation is that the theme of miscommunication was a statement on the Beatles' divergence from their audience, {{during a time when}} the group had tired of performing concerts before screaming fans.|$|E
