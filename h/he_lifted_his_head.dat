60|$|And for {{the first}} time <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to look at me with wonder and incredulity. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> so sharply that there could be no mistake.

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>he</b> sees <b>his</b> staff; [...] He touches--'tis {{to him a}} treasure! [...] Faint {{recollection}} {{seems to}} tell [...] That he is yet where mortals dwell-- [...] A thought received with languid pleasure! [...] 545 ...|$|R
60|$|King Midas bowed low; {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> the lustrous {{stranger}} had vanished.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> suddenly; we had {{imagined}} {{for a moment}} that he had been dozing.|$|E
6000|$|Surprise, eagerness, {{a lively}} curiosity {{are all in}} your face on the instant; but the {{beautiful}} creature before you only draws himself together with quiet self-possession. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly; a superior look creeps into his eyes; {{he seems to be}} speaking.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> big <b>head</b> {{from the}} pile of karosses on which he was lying and peered at me across the fire.|$|R

60|$|For a {{while the}} prince thought, till {{presently}} his form straightened itself, and with a quick movement <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This time <b>he</b> moved--he <b>lifted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when <b>he</b> saw me. Shall I {{ever forget}} the silent misery in that face, the dull dreadful stare in those tearless eyes? ...|$|R

60|$|Still, the Water-Witch betrayed no {{symptoms}} of alarm. The meaning {{eye of the}} image seemed to study the motions of her adversary, with all the understanding of an intelligent being; and occasionally the brigantine turned slightly in the varying currents of the air, as if volition directed {{the movements of the}} little fabric.

6000|$|V. 7. For [...] "therefore," [...] {{translate}} [...] "then shall <b>he</b> <b>lift</b> up <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again;" [...] that is, {{as a man}} languid and sinking from thirst {{and fatigue}} after refreshment.|$|R
