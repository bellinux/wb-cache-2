5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, {{a person may}} only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board, which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> Hindu. Similarly, one may only {{be a member of}} the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E

5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> judged to be insane {{under the terms of the}} Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has {{less than half of the}} total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E

25|$|When a {{justiciable}} issue arises, the decision-maker must give the parties a fair opportunity {{to present their}} cases and to correct or contradict any relevant statements prejudicial to them. Generally, it is a denial of natural justice to fail to disclose to a party specific evidence relevant to the decision <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> thereby deprived of an opportunity to comment on it.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{where the}} person named as {{executor}} cannot administer the probate, or wishes {{to have someone}} else do so, another person is named administrator. An executor or an administrator may receive compensation for his service. Additionally, beneficiaries of an estate {{may be able to}} remove the appointed executor <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not capable of properly fulfilling his or her duties.|$|E

25|$|The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 {{requires}} anyone seeking Medicaid {{to produce}} documents {{to prove that he}} is a United States citizen or resident alien. An exception is made for Emergency Medicaid where payments are allowed for the pregnant and disabled regardless of immigration status. Special rules exist for those living in a nursing home and disabled children living at home. A child may be covered under Medicaid <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the public}} are {{eligible}} to make a complaint if they are the person who the behaviour about which they want to complain about was directed towards, if they were ‘adversely affected' by said behaviour or if they were an eyewitness to said behaviour. A person is 'adversely affected' {{if he or she}} suffers any form of loss or damage, distress or inconvenience, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> put in danger or is otherwise unduly put at risk of being adversely affected.|$|E

25|$|The SCJA {{does not}} contain any {{provisions}} {{similar to the ones}} referred to above that apply to Supreme Court judges. Nonetheless, at common law a judge can be disqualified from hearing or deciding a case <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> actually biased against a party, or appears to biased. The test for apparent bias is whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Livni was {{appointed}} as Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs. She held this position until 2009. In Ehud Olmert's government, Livni was also appointed Designated Acting Prime Minister (also known as Vice Prime Minister), taking {{the place of}} the prime minister <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> outside the country or temporarily or permanently unable to fulfill his or her duties. She ceased serving as Justice Minister at that time, but again held that position from 29 November 2006 to 7 February 2007, while still serving in her primary role of Foreign Minister.|$|E
25|$|A cutter is a fast {{ball that}} is spinning, that is, a {{delivery}} that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead {{of keeping the}} seam straight. While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still {{enough to make a}} batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball. Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler to get the ball to move <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not receiving much assistance from the pitch.|$|E

25|$|Accidents {{and lasting}} damage can {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out {{because one of the}} veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} names {{is governed by}} strict norms in {{traditional}} Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders. It is acceptable to call someone {{by his or her}} given name <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's age is a year older than the speaker. This is often a source of pragmatic difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E
