50|$|Based {{upon the}} work of the {{international}} AGREE Collaboration for the quality of clinical practice guidelines, an organised network for organisations and experts working in the field of evidence-based guidelines was proposed in early 2002 at the first <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> conference in Berlin, Germany. Guideline experts called for international standardized guideline methods, and information exchange in this field. The proposal was endorsed by health care agencies {{from all parts of the}} world such as AHRQ (USA), CBO (NL) German Agency for Quality in Medicine, NICE (UK), SIGN (UK), and NZGG (NZ).Against this background the Guidelines International Network G-I-N was founded in November 2002 in Paris with Günter Ollenschläger as founding chairman.|$|E
50|$|The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers is an <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> {{regulating}} how {{rivers and}} their connected groundwaters that cross national boundaries may be used, {{adopted by the}} International Law Association (ILA) in Helsinki, Finland in August 1966. In spite of its adoption by the ILA, there is no mechanism in place that enforces the rules. Notwithstanding the guideline's lack of formal status, its work on rules governing international rivers was pioneering. It {{led to the creation}} of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. In 2004, it was superseded by the Berlin Rules on Water Resources.|$|E

50|$|In Madrid in 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} extracting organs from executed prisoners due {{to the difficulty of}} knowing if they had given consent. Growing concern led other professional societies and human rights organisations to condemn the practice in the 1990s, and to question {{the way in which the}} organs were obtained. The WHO starting drafting an <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> (WHA44.25) on human organ transplants in 1987 which resulted in the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation being endorsed in 1991. However, the wording did not allow the international community to draw up any laws preventing China from continuing to trade in human organs.|$|E

50|$|Standards {{regulate}} production {{methods and}} in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 EU-Eco-regulation developed for European Union, which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the National Organic Program (NOP). As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming (IFOAM 2007:11). In 2005 IFOAM created the Principles of Organic Agriculture, an <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> for certification criteria. Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.|$|E

50|$|A health {{department}} or health ministry {{is a part}} of government which focuses on issues related to the general health of the citizenry. Subnational entities, such as states, counties and cities, often also operate a {{health department}} of their own. Health departments perform food inspections and other health related inspections (the person who performs this job is often called a public health inspector), vaccination programs, free STD and HIV tests, tobacco enforcement and cessation programs, and other medical assistance programs. Health departments also compile statistics about health issues of their area. In 1986, several of the worlds' national health departments met to establish an <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> by which health departments operate. The meeting was in Ottawa, Canada, and hence the guidelines established are known as the Ottawa Charter. The Ottawa Charter was designed to ‘achieve Health for All’.|$|E

In The Netherlands, two bodies (CBO and NHG) publish specialist and primary care guidelines, respectively [...] In Germany, the German Agency for Quality in Medicine (ÄZQ) coordinates a national program for disease management guidelines. All these organisations are now members of the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), an international network of organisations and individuals involved in clinical practice guidelines.

5000|$|Since 1955, Jordan and Israel {{have held}} regular talks over {{the sharing of}} the Jordan River. International law {{considers}} states and institutions created by states as the only legitimate actors, which explains why Palestinians have not been {{as much a part}} of the conversation as some might argue they should be. The ambiguity of international law tends to unintentionally favor Israel in this way: it is an established state while Palestinians are not yet united as a sovereign, internationally recognized entity.Experts have argued that water laws ought to be more concrete though this seems difficult because of the variation in each geographic space and each political situation. There is no formula for exactly how to divide up the waters. Some guidelines do exist, however, as a frame of reference [...] Many rules of law pertaining to shared water resources follow the precedent of The Helsinki Rules, an <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> on the regulation of transnational rivers and their groundwaters. These rules rely on five principles: [...] "reasonable and equitable utilization, avoidance of significant harm to other users or states, advance notification, consultation and negotiation,exchange of information, peaceful settlements of disputes." [...] These principles are largely seen as soft or customary law. After the Helsinki Rules were published, the U.N. began to research the topic of international water law which culminated in the formulation of the 1997 UN Convention on the NonNavigational Uses of International Watercourses. This convention, like the Helsinki Rules, is also largely considered customary law. The aquifers under dispute in Israel-Palestine are transboundary aquifers: in which a political boundary is between the outflow and recharge areas. The international laws can be used toward policy making, though nothing concrete has yet been ratified.|$|E

The incidence of EC contamination was higher in Mexico than in Guatemala, however, concentrations were below <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> levels (< 0. 15 mg/L).

The <b>international</b> <b>guideline</b> recommends for anticoagulation treatment to be maintained for at least 3 months in all patients with acute PVT. Low-molecular-weight-heparin and changing to warfarin is the usual anticoagulation treatment. However, warfarin therapy is problematic due to a narrow therapeutic window and the requirement for frequent dose adjustment, which has prompted the development of novel oral anticoagulants for overcoming these problems.
