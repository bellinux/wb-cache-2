25|$|The sling is of {{interest}} to athletes who desire to break distance records; the best modern material is a polyester twine (trade name <b>Dacron).</b>|$|E
25|$|DeBakey {{pioneered the}} use of <b>Dacron</b> grafts to replace or repair blood vessels. In 1958, to {{counteract}} narrowing of an artery caused by an endarterectomy, DeBakey performed the first successful patch-graft angioplasty. This procedure involved patching the slit in the artery from an endarterectomy with a <b>Dacron</b> or vein graft. The patch widened the artery so that when it closed, the channel of the artery returned to normal size. The DeBakey artificial graft is now used {{around the world to}} replace or repair blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the company}} sold its {{textiles}} business, which included {{some of its}} best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), <b>Dacron</b> polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.|$|E
25|$|In {{improving}} the RX650 {{the company made}} 186 design changes to produce the SS-11. The most obvious change was the move from <b>Dacron</b> envelopes for the wings to doped aircraft fabric covering.|$|E
25|$|Paresev 1A - {{first flight}} May 18, 1962, last flight was on June 28, 1962. Used a rebuilt frame from the Paresev 1, {{but had a}} control stick and a <b>Dacron</b> {{membrane}} wing.|$|E
25|$|Dark blue (or more {{accurately}} <b>Dacron</b> blue) is the organisational colour of the Singapore Police Force, and has remained so continuously since 1969, although the first police uniforms introduced in 1856 {{were also in}} the same colour.|$|E
25|$|The series {{all share}} similar {{construction}} featuring a bolted aluminium tube structure with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> sailcloth envelopes. All models are open-cockpit, but some have optional streamlined pods available. All models use {{tricycle landing gear}} and steerable nosewheels.|$|E
25|$|After the war, DuPont {{continued}} {{its emphasis on}} new materials, developing Mylar, <b>Dacron,</b> Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were {{critical to the success}} of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.|$|E
25|$|Like many Rans models, {{the family}} {{features}} a welded 4130 steel tube cockpit, with a bolted 6061-T6 aluminum tube rear fuselage. All fuselage, wing and tail surfaces {{are covered in}} <b>Dacron</b> or on some models dope and fabric. The wings are built from aluminium tube and ribs, feature flaps and are folding or removable.|$|E
25|$|The glider wing is {{made from}} Porcher Marine Skytex 44 g/m2 nylon fabric. The rib {{reinforcements}} are 310 g/m2 <b>Dacron,</b> with the trailing edge reinforcement fabricated of 175 g/m2 polyester. The lines are all sheathed Kevlar and 1.1 and 1.7mm in diameter or, optionally, 0.6 and 0.9mm micro unsheathed lines. The risers are made from 20mm wide Polyamida strapping.|$|E
25|$|Construction of all Pterodactyl {{aircraft}} was of similar material, predominantly anodized 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, braced with swaged steel cables {{supported by a}} king post, with a sewn <b>Dacron</b> sail for wing covering. Fittings to join the tubing was either extruded or made from sheet, connected with aircraft AN bolts. The sails came {{in a wide variety}} of colour combinations.|$|E
25|$|In early 1992 Leden {{took part}} in the Flight of the <b>Dacron</b> Eagles, a 1000-mile, three-week {{microlight}} and hang glider expedition down the rift valley in Kenya, filming for the BBC 1 Classic Adventure series with cameramen Sid Perou, microlight pilots Richard Meredith-Hardy and Ben Ashman and hang glider pilots Mark Dale, Tim Hudson and Louise Anderton.|$|E
25|$|In China, the unisex Zhongshan suit {{declined}} {{after the}} death of Mao Zedong, the removal of the Gang of Four, and the liberalisation of trade links and international relations during the mid and late 80s. Wealthier Chinese women began wearing Western inspired fashions again, including red or yellow miniskirts in addition to the more typical shirt dresses, white plimsolls and <b>dacron</b> blouses.|$|E
25|$|The Challenger {{ultralight}} {{is a high}} wing, tricycle gear kit aircraft with a {{frame structure}} built from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy tubing fastened with aircraft grade AN bolts and rivets and covered with either presewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes or standard aircraft fabric. The engine is mounted in pusher configuration and turns the propeller through a reduction drive that uses a cogged tooth rubber belt.|$|E
25|$|The Cronin–Gerow Implant, {{prosthesis}} model 1963, was a {{silicone rubber}} envelope-sac, {{shaped like a}} teardrop, which was filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce {{the rotation of the}} emplaced breast-implant upon the chest wall, the model 1963 prosthesis was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch, made of <b>Dacron</b> material (Polyethylene terephthalate), which was attached {{to the rear of the}} breast-implant shell.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle design sold {{in large}} numbers, but {{suffered}} many wing failures {{that resulted in}} several fatalities {{as a result of}} the deterioration of the unreinforced <b>Dacron</b> sailcloth trailing edge design. The lawsuits, {{as a result of the}} design defects, put the company out of business in about 1984, just as the market for ultralight aircraft in the United States collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Most rigid {{production}} kayaks are {{now made}} out of fiberglass, rotomolded polyethylene, thermoformed plastic, blow moulded polyethylene or carbon-kevlar. More exotic materials include carbon fiber and foam core. Some kayaks are hand-built from plywood or wood strips covered with fiberglass. Skin-on-frame kayaks are built on wood or aluminum frames covered in canvas, <b>dacron,</b> or other fabrics, and may include inflatable tubes called sponsons.|$|E

25|$|All {{models of}} the S-6 feature a welded 4130 steel tube cockpit, with a bolted {{aluminum}} tube rear fuselage, wing and tail surfaces all covered in fabric. In the initial S-6 and S-6ES, the fabric consists of pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes, which shorten construction time. The S-6S, however, uses the more traditional dope and fabric. The reported construction times for the ES are 250 man-hours versus 500 for the Super.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk wing is strut-braced, {{constructed}} from aluminum tubing {{and covered with}} either pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes or doped aircraft fabric. The wing also features flaps. The fuselage is of similar construction and uses a curved boom tube for its main structural member. The curved tube allows the tail to be located higher, out of the wing's downwash, especially when the flaps are extended. Landing gear for all models is optionally tricycle or conventional.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} XA {{model is}} constructed from bolted together anodized aluminum tubing, with a fiberglass hull. The wire-braced wing {{is supported by}} a king post and is of aluminum structure, covered with pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> covers. The wing features 2/3 span ailerons and no flaps. The tail wheel is retractable via a cable control, while the main landing gear is removed by the pilot in flight and stowed in the cockpit for landing on water after a land take-off.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1950s, {{underwear}} {{consisted of}} simple, white pieces of clothing {{which were not}} to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like <b>Dacron,</b> nylon and Spandex. By 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{experimented with}} the {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, which they renamed the Parawing, {{in order to}} evaluate it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules and recovery of used Saturn rocket stages. Under a directive by Paul Bikle, NASA engineer Charles Richard in 1961–1962 designed the collapsible four-tube Rogallo wing used in the Paresev. The Paresev series included wing configurations that were tightly foldable from the nose plate for easy transport, using initially a cloth sail and later one of <b>Dacron.</b>|$|E
25|$|Potential restorers {{of older}} boats {{who wanted to}} race were {{potentially}} faced with a dilemma of whether to restore a boat to its original specification or make modifications to make an older design competitive with a newer design. For example, a yacht designed under the First International Rule would have a wooden mast, gaff rig, and sails made of cotton; whereas yachts designed under the Third International Rule, such as Vim, had a metal mast, Bermuda rig, and sails made from <b>Dacron.</b>|$|E
25|$|Replacement of {{the damaged}} section of aorta with a sutureless {{vascular}} ring connector-reinforced <b>Dacron</b> graft: The vascular ring connector is a titanic ring {{used as a}} stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. Two furrows {{on the surface of}} the ring are for fixation of the vascular graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.|$|E
25|$|The longe line (or longe) {{is about}} 30 feet (10 m) long, so the longeing circle {{can have a}} {{diameter}} of 60 feet (20 m). It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or <b>Dacron.</b> In the natural horsemanship tradition, the longe line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton longe lines {{are less likely to}} burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable and less likely to break.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 valve {{replacement}} procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing {{the flow of blood}} as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called <b>Dacron</b> (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} {{surgical}} repair of type A dissections is that ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes {{down into the}} aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be resuspended {{in order to be}} reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a <b>Dacron</b> graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Aircraft Sales and Parts (ASAP) of Vernon, British Columbia {{purchased}} the Beaver tooling and redesigned the RX 550. The new version, designated the RX 550 Plus incorporated a new wing {{with a greater}} number of wing ribs and standard aircraft fabric replacing the <b>Dacron</b> covering. The ASAP RX 550 Plus remains in production and available in kit form. It can be registered in the Canadian Basic and Advanced ultralight categories {{as well as in the}} US and Canadian amateur-built aircraft categories. By the end of 2007 a total of 2000 RX 550s had been produced by all manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 a new company, Freedom Lite of Walton, Ontario reintroduced the Beaver RX 650, first {{displaying}} it at Sun 'n Fun that year. The improved RX 650 incorporated 186 {{changes over}} the previous RX 650 design and the company renamed it the Freedom Lite SS-11 Skywatch. The wings use conventional aircraft fabric instead of <b>Dacron,</b> giving build times of about 250 hours. The company placed the aircraft in the Canadian AULA category. Freedom Lite soon {{went out of business}} and the design was acquired by Legend Lite of New Hamburg, Ontario. This new company also closed its doors in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Introduced in 1995, the single-seat Aventura has repositionable main landing gear, {{down for}} runways and up for landing on water. The {{steerable}} tail wheel is retractable {{in concert with}} the repositioning of the main gear. There is no water rudder. The wing is an aluminium frame covered with pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes. The hull is constructed from fibreglass and the wingtip floats are polyethylene. The remainder of the structure is anodized aluminium tubing, bolted together. Controls are conventional three-axis, with full span ailerons and no flaps. The company claims that the fast-build kit can be constructed in 90 hours.|$|E
25|$|All {{models are}} {{constructed}} from anodized aluminum tubing assembled with bolts. The fuselage is suspended from a keel tube that also mounts the engine at the front, the tail {{at the back}} and the wings. The wings are strut-braced and utilize jury struts. The wings and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes, which reduces construction time. The wings have full-span ailerons, while the tail features conventional elevators and rudder. The landing gear is a tricycle gear arrangement with bungee suspension on the main wheels. The nosewheel is steerable and mainwheel brakes are an available option. The reported construction time for the single seat models is 100 hours.|$|E
25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene terephthalate, {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} Terylene or <b>Dacron.</b> Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene (the fabric that is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E
25|$|The Beaver {{family of}} {{aircraft}} all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 aluminum tube {{that supports the}} tail, landing gear and seats. The wings and engine mount are similarly of 6061-T6 aluminum tube and attached to the main tube by connecting struts. The wing features aluminum tube spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn <b>Dacron</b> envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits {{in as little as}} 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory-claimed build times 150–200 hours for the SS and 180–200 hours to the RX 550 Plus.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1969, <b>dacron</b> blue made a {{comeback}} to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, {{in part to}} coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary {{since its founding in}} 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} can {{be carried}} out under local anaesthetic. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stich under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse. Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891. Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and <b>Dacron.</b> This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum. This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures. This procedure is generally reserved for debilitated or other individuals at high anesthetic risk, who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.|$|E
