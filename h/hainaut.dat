5|$|The {{series of}} boulevards {{created by the}} project– <b>Hainaut</b> Boulevard (now Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard), Central Boulevard (now Boulevard Anspach), North Boulevard (now Adolphe Max Boulevard), and Senne Boulevard (now Émile Jacqmain Boulevard)– were {{progressively}} opened to traffic from 1871 to 1873.|$|E
5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some states had already begun to refuse payment of taxes to the Austrian authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of <b>Hainaut</b> and Brabant were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In December 1415 Dauphin Louis died {{suddenly}} at age 18 of illness, leaving Isabeau's political status unclear. Her 17-year-old fourth-born son, John of Touraine, now the Dauphin, {{had been raised}} since childhood in the household of Duke William II of Bavaria in <b>Hainaut.</b> Married to Countess Jacqueline of <b>Hainaut,</b> Dauphin John was a Burgundian sympathizer. William of Bavaria refused {{to send him to}} Paris during a period of upheaval as Burgundians plundered the city and Parisians revolted against another wave of tax increases initiated by Count Bernard VII of Armagnac; in a period of lucidity, Charles had raised the Count to be the Constable of France. Isabeau attempted to intervene by arranging a meeting with Jacqueline in 1416, but Armagnac refused to allow Isabeau to reconcile with the House of Burgundy, while William II continued to prevent the young Dauphin from entering Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} <b>Hainaut</b> in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near <b>Hainaut</b> were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Before her {{presentation}} to Charles, Isabeau visited <b>Hainaut</b> {{for about a}} month, staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, ruler of some of Bavaria-Straubing and Count of Holland. Albert's wife, Margaret of Brieg, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed unsuitable as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13July 1385 she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier <b>Hainaut</b> and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{the capital}} of a chatellany (an {{administrative}} district) during the Middle Ages, serving as the administrative centre for an area comprising about fifty towns and villages. It {{was the site of}} a second battle that took place on 23 August 1328 involving Philip VI of France and a rebel force led by Nicolaas Zannekin. The rebels had driven the ruling Count Louis I out of Flanders and sought to press their advantage by occupying Cassel and attacking the French royal army nearby. Although they achieved some initial successes, the rebels were decisively defeated when William I, Count of <b>Hainaut</b> lent his support to the French side.|$|E
5|$|Edward's opponents {{began to}} gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became {{increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} possibility that Mortimer might invade England. Isabella and Mortimer turned to William, the Count of <b>Hainaut,</b> and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William's daughter, Philippa. In return for the advantageous alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 transport vessels and 8 warships to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian army, under Field Marshal Blasius Columban, Freiherr von Bender, invaded in the United Belgian States and {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the population which was already discontented with the governance and infighting of the rebels. The Austrians defeated the Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne on 28 September. <b>Hainaut</b> {{was the first to}} recognise Leopold's sovereignty and other cities soon followed. Namur was captured on 24 November. The Sovereign Congress met for the final time on 27 November before disbanding itself. On 3 December, the Austrians accepted the surrender of Brussels and reoccupied the city, effectively marking the suppression of the revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of <b>Hainaut</b> and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
5|$|In June 1315, Glarentza was {{captured}} by the Aragonese troops of the infante Ferdinand of Majorca, who claimed the princely title of Achaea for himself {{by virtue of his}} marriage to Isabella of Sabran, granddaughter of William II of Villehardouin. Ferdinand made Glarentza his residence, and soon seized all of Elis, aided by the defection of several Achaean barons dissatisfied with the Principality's rule by the Angevins of Naples. Ferdinand began minting coins with his name—the rarest issues of the Glarentza mint—but his reign was cut short {{with the arrival of the}} legitimate claimants, Matilda of <b>Hainaut</b> and Louis of Burgundy. In the Battle of Manolada, fought to the northeast of Glarentza on 5 July 1316, the Aragonese were defeated and Ferdinand was killed. The remainder of his army fled to Glarentza, and soon handed over the town and the other fortresses they had occupied and departed the Peloponnese, taking the corpse of Ferdinand with them.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms {{to be a threat}} to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular <b>Hainaut,</b> Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in <b>Hainaut</b> (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{joined a}} crusade against the pagan Lithuanians in December 1344. The crusadersincluding John of Bohemia, Charles of Moravia, Peter of Bourbon, and William of <b>Hainaut</b> and Holland laid siege to Vilnius. However, a Lithuanian {{invasion}} of the lands of the Teutonic Knights forced them to lift the siege. Louis returned to Hungary in late February 1345. He dispatched Andrew Lackfi to invade the lands of the Golden Horde {{in retaliation for the}} Tatars' earlier plundering raids against Transylvania and the Szepesség (now Spiš in Slovakia). Lackfi and his army of mainly Székely warriors inflicted a defeat on a large Tatar army. Thereafter the Golden Horde's control of the lands between the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea weakened. A conflict between Louis's uncle and father-in-law (Casimir III of Poland and Charles of Moravia) led to a war between Poland and Bohemia in April. In this war Louis supported his uncle with reinforcements in accordance with the agreement of 1339.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord {{proved a}} {{successful}} breed for the farmers that developed it, and quickly {{spread throughout the}} Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It was given different names depending on the country, and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands, Brabants and the Ardennes. Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century, {{and at this point}} blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to the breed. The Trait du Nord gradually began to differ from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits, and the breed became popular in the north and east of France. In 1855, even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes, veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near <b>Hainaut</b> as superior to Flemish breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The <b>Hainaut</b> region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Nijmegen, signed 10 August 1678, {{ended the}} Franco-Dutch War. The great loser {{in the war}} was Spain, ceding to France a list of places - Franche-Comté, the forts on the Aire and Saint-Omer, Cambrai, Valenciennes and Maubeuge in <b>Hainaut.</b> From {{the time of the}} Revolution, these French lands in Flanders and <b>Hainaut</b> would become the département of Nord.|$|E

25|$|Before the battle, a {{party of}} knights, led by William's uncle, John of <b>Hainaut,</b> Lord of Beaumont, went ashore south of Staveren, and {{captured}} the monastery of Saint Odulphus. What happened next is still not entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|Léopold Ferdinand Elie Victor Albert Marie, Count of <b>Hainaut</b> (as {{eldest son}} of the heir apparent), later Duke of Brabant (as heir apparent), born at Laeken on 12 June 1859, and died at Laeken on 22 January 1869, from pneumonia, after falling into a pond.|$|E
25|$|In 1285, the {{currency}} of <b>Hainaut</b> was replaced by {{the currency}} of France: the French écu. Valenciennes was full of activity, with numerous corporations, and outside its walls a large number of convents developed, like that of the Dominicans (whose church was excavated by the Valenciennes Archaeological Service in 1989 and 1990).|$|E
25|$|Taking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer {{left the}} French court in summer 1326 and {{travelled}} north to William I, Count of <b>Hainaut.</b> As Joan had suggested the previous year, Isabella betrothed Prince Edward to Philippa, {{the daughter of}} the Count, in exchange for a substantial dowry. She then used this money plus an earlier loan from Charles to raise a mercenary army, scouring Brabant for men, which were added to a small force of <b>Hainaut</b> troops. William also provided eight men of war ships and various smaller vessels as part of the marriage arrangements. Although Edward was now fearing an invasion, secrecy remained key, and Isabella convinced William to detain envoys from Edward. Isabella also appears to have made a secret agreement with the Scots {{for the duration of the}} forthcoming campaign. On 22 September, Isabella, Mortimer and their modest force set sail for England.|$|E
25|$|In 1420, {{during the}} Hook and Cod wars, Duke John III of Bavaria {{along with his}} army marched from Gouda in the {{direction}} of Leiden in order to conquer the city since Leiden did not pay the new Count of Holland Jacqueline, Countess of <b>Hainaut,</b> his niece and only daughter of Count William VI of Holland.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{connection}} of the Willebroek Canal with the Brussels-Charleroi Canal, in {{the very heart of}} the capital, creates a north-south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of <b>Hainaut</b> (Wallonia). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important inclined plane of Ronquières and the lifts of Strépy-Bracquegnies.|$|E
25|$|William IV {{had fought}} against the Muslims in Granada, {{travelled}} through Venice and Cyprus to the Holy Land, and had been on crusade against the pagan Prussians three times.

25|$|An {{alternate}} tradition {{holds that}} Poirot {{was born in}} the village of Ellezelles (province of <b>Hainaut,</b> Belgium). A few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot {{can be seen in the}} centre of this village. There appears to be no reference to this in Christie's writings, but the town of Ellezelles cherishes a copy of Poirot's birth certificate in a local memorial 'attesting' Poirot's birth, naming his father and mother as Jules-Louis Poirot and Godelieve Poirot.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of the Prince of Achaea, Florent of <b>Hainaut,</b> his widow, Princess Isabella of Villehardouin {{appointed}} Richard to rule in her stead as bailli and withdrew to the castle of Kalamata. His tenure appears to have been peaceful as regards the conflict with the Byzantine Greeks of Mystras, but the issue of the succession remained open as Isabella had but one daughter, Matilda of <b>Hainaut</b> (born 1293). On the suggestion of Richard Orsini, the young heiress of Achaea was engaged to the young Duke of Athens, Guy II de la Roche. Their marriage took place in 1305. Richard kept his post until 1300, when he was replaced by Nicholas III of Saint Omer, at the advice of chancellor Benjamin of Kalamata. This began a period of rivalry between Richard and Benjamin; in 1303, Richard's friends at court persuaded Prince Philip of Savoy to detain Benjamin, who was released after paying 20,000 hyperpyra as ransom. In turn, Benjamin gained the ear of the Prince, and forced Richard to give up the same sum in exchange for possession of half a village, which returned to the princely domain following Richard's death.|$|E
