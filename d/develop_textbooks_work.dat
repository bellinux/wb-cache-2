40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are: (1) to {{identify}} the needs of English teaching materials based on local culture for grade VII students of junior high school and (2) to develop an appropriate guideline of English teaching materials based on local culture for grade VII students of junior high school. The development of this guideline aims to provide guidance for English teachers in <b>developing</b> <b>textbooks</b> of English teaching materials based on local culture. This study was research and development. The data were collected by means of questionnaires, observation, and interviews. There were two types of data collected, namely quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data were obtained by using questionnaires while the qualitative data were obtained through interviews. The steps in developing this guideline included conducting the needs analysis, writing a syllabus, developing the first draft, reviewing the first draft, evaluating the draft, trying out the draft, and writing the final draft. Based on the research findings, the English teachers have not known yet the way to <b>develop</b> <b>textbook</b> of English teaching materials that relate to local culture. The appropriate topics were traditional house, traditional food, traditional music, traditional dance, and tourism place. The product {{of this study}} is a guideline to <b>develop</b> <b>textbook</b> of English teaching materials based on local culture. It consists of cover, preface, table of contents, introduction, English materials based on local culture, the steps in <b>developing</b> English <b>textbook,</b> and the example of English materials. The product is considered applicable and appropriate according to the responses to it. The responses of the English teachers show the mean value ranging from 2. 91 to 3. 82, while the mean value of the students was ranging 2. 94 to 3. 62. It means both of mean value results categorized into “good” and “very good” based on interval range 2. 52 to ≥ 3. 28.

40|$|The {{activity}} of 'reasoning-and-proving' {{can serve as}} a vehicle to mathematical sense making and is thus important for students' learning of mathematics at all levels of education. Yet, reasoning-and-proving does not receive appropriate attention in typical classroom practice, and many students face serious difficulties with it. One important, albeit underexplored and insufficiently exploited, leverage point for supporting classroom work on reasoning-and-proving is textbooks. As a first step towards a possible longer-term goal to <b>develop</b> <b>textbooks</b> that can appropriately support classroom work on reasoning-and-proving, it is necessary to understand how reasoning-and-proving is treated in existing textbooks and to grapple with the many methodological challenges that surround textbook analyses on reasoning-and-proving. © 2014...|$|R

Results revealed that conceptual change oriented instruction caused better understanding, and two modes of instruction developed similar attitude toward chemistry. Science process skill was a strong predictor in understanding, but no effect of gender difference on understanding and on students’ attitudes was found. Also, semi-structured interviews were used to examine students’ understanding in detail. © 2012 IOJES. All rights reserve...|$|R
