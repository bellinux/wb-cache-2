The series consists of ten <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> have been collected in two trade paperbacks. It was written by Kate Leth with art by Drew Rausch.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{served as}} {{a federal judge in}} the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, {{including}} torts, contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law. His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited courtroom experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand's early cases concerned bankruptcy <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> he found tiresome, and patent law, which fascinated him.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1995, Boeing {{delivered}} {{the first model}} with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways, which entered service five days later. Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997, returning to full service later that year. General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades.|$|E

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|After {{his partner}} {{developed}} cancer in late 2011, Davies {{returned to the}} UK, and co-created the CBBC drama, Wizards vs Aliens, which aired from 2012 to 2014. He created Cucumber, a Channel 4 series about middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene; Banana, an E4 series about young LGBT people in the Cucumber universe; and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> have arisen in the sister series, modern sex and sexuality with the cast and public. All three shows aired in 2015 for a single series.|$|E

After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point {{that he was able to}} continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.|$|E
5|$|ECOSOC's {{subsidiary}} bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous <b>Issues,</b> <b>which</b> advises UN agencies on {{issues relating to}} indigenous peoples; the United Nations Forum on Forests, which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the United Nations Statistical Commission, which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies; and the Commission on Sustainable Development, which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards sustainable development. ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations; by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had received this status.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} release, Cannibal Holocaust {{has been the}} target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine cruelty to animals, <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> find Cannibal Holocaust in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, Cannibal Holocaust has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly magazine named Cannibal Holocaust as the 20th most controversial film of all time.|$|E

5|$|Static Shock {{had some}} {{alterations}} {{from the original}} comic book because it was oriented to a pre-teen audience. Nevertheless, the show approached several social <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> was positively received by most television critics. Static Shock was nominated for numerous awards, including the Daytime Emmy. Some criticism was directed towards its jokes—which {{were said to be}} stale and too similar to Spider-Man style—and animation, which was said to be unnatural and overdated. The series also produced some related merchandise, which sold poorly; McDuffie cited the low sales as one of the main factors behind the series' cancellation. In spite of this, its popularity revived interest in the original Milestone comic and introduced McDuffie to the animation industry.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road {{was planned}} by the Ministry of Transport {{in the early}} 20th century {{as part of a}} general {{programme}} of traffic improvements across London. In 1903, a proposal for new approach roads was submitted to the Royal Commission on London Traffic, but was rejected. The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> led to the London Arterial Road Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. Progress was halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when it was hoped it would find work for demobilised soldiers.|$|E

Interior artwork was not used for the first <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> contained no fiction other than a single novel; illustrations began to appear with issue 29. Tubb announced in issue 85, which turned out to be the last issue, that he had dropped all interior artwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{specifically}} military grievances {{that led}} to the mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry centred on the personality of the commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin. He had been promoted from major in the regiment, bur the previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his fellow officers and that he inspired little respect among the men. His appointment led to disunity amongst the British officers, which was reflected by division among the Indian officers over the promotion to commissioned rank of a colour-havildar. The <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> might, under ordinary circumstances, have been of limited impact, were aggregated by the disruptive external influences of the Ghadar Party propaganda noted above and the entry of Turkey into the war.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical <b>issues,</b> <b>which</b> was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Thursday, and two on Saturday. The Thursday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Thursday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, at 1 minute and 23.039 seconds, three-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Coulthard was third fastest, ahead of Fisichella and Frentzen. Alesi managed sixth despite suffering from gearbox <b>issues</b> <b>which</b> caused him to pull up on the track. Eddie Irvine, Jenson Button, Barrichello and Salo completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane spun and lost his front right wheel in a crash at turn 17 and Ralf Schumacher made contact with the barrier at turn eight. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:21.387; Coulthard finished with the third fastest time. The McLaren drivers were separated by Michael Schumacher. Eddie Irvine was running quicker and was fourth fastest, in front of Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Alesi continued to encounter problems though he managed to be seventh quickest. de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello followed in the top ten. Both Nick Heidfeld and Pedro Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn 17 and Wurz crashed {{at the swimming pool}} complex.|$|E
5|$|GA is {{regulated}} by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and {{the objective is to}} promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental <b>issues</b> <b>which,</b> particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.|$|E
