DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century.

40|$|The {{third most}} {{consumed}} meat {{around the world}} is beef. Despite global growth in demand, cattle markets experience price cycles related to biological production lags causing variability in cash flow and profitability for producers. Price-driven <b>herd</b> size <b>management</b> strategies thus have received attention. This study adds to that literature by analyzing both price and production risk using three <b>herd</b> size <b>management</b> strategies: i) steady state – holding herd size constant; ii) dollar cost averaging – keeping reinvestment constant by varying the number of replacement heifers retained at a constant long run average dollar total; and iii) moving average – using an uptrend/downtrend price signal to lower/increase production in anticipation of future price declines/increases. These strategies are evaluated over the most recent 2004 - 2014 cattle cycle based on their relative profitability and risk with and without forage variability as a result of weather simulation on forage yields. This analysis is useful for decision makers of medium- to large-scale cow-calf operations.
