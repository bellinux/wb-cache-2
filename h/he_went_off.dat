5|$|Following his discharge, Statton {{settled in}} Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained {{employment}} in the timber industry. True to her word that she would leave him if <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires {{broke out in the}} Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 1994 Australian Grand Prix, the final {{race of the}} 1994 season, Schumacher led Damon Hill by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning, but on lap 35 <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> track and hit the wall with his right side wheels, {{returning}} to the track at reduced speed, and with car damage, but still leading the race. At the next corner Hill attempted {{to pass on the}} inside, but Schumacher turned in sharply and they collided. Both cars were eliminated from the race and, as neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver, but public opinion is divided over the incident, and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.|$|E
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> {{the track}} in the process. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap although he stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, Lukas entered Oxbow in Oaklawn Park's key preparatory {{race for}} the Arkansas Derby, the Grade II Rebel Stakes. For {{the fourth time in}} five races, Oxbow started on the far outside at post ten. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> as the {{favorite}} {{for the second time in}} his career, at 4–1. Lukas switched Jon Court to ride stablemate Will Take Charge, and Oxbow was given yet another jockey, Mike Smith. Oxbow was third out of the gate. He took the lead down the backstretch and stayed in front until the end of the race where he was narrowly defeated by Will Take Charge. Oxbow lost by half a head, but earned his first triple-digit speed figure at 101, along with 20 Derby qualification points. After the Rebel Stakes, Oxbow was ranked as one of the top ten horses in some Triple Crown pre-race polls, and secured eligibility to run in the Derby with 36 points.|$|E
5|$|In LMP2, Bird and Julien Canal {{took the}} fastest two-lap average time of 2:07.761; Canal pushed hard on new tyres during his second timed run having disliked his {{previous}} attempt. The pair were two-tenths {{of a second}} faster than the second-place qualifiers, Howson and Lapierre, and held the class pole position until Canal's lap. Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car took third in the category, while the second G-Drive Racing entry was fourth, with fifth-placed qualifier Tincknell recording the session's best class individual lap time. Richie Stanaway and Rees, competing in the No. 99 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average time of 2:16.840. Gianmaria Bruni was 0.070 seconds off the Aston Martin's pace, and started from {{second place in the}} category, displacing Turner and Mücke from the position. Turner's fastest lap was invalidated after <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the track and was required to set another time. James Calado and Davide Rigon secured fourth in AF Corse's No. 71 Ferrari with Sørensen and Nygaard rounding out the top five. Aston Martin's No. 98 entry driven by Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took pole position in LMGTE Am, more than a second faster than the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Corvette of Paolo Ruberti and Gianluca Roda.|$|E

5|$|On race day, a 30-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{before the event}} began; Kanaan again posted the fastest time (35.288), {{followed}} by Zanardi and Paul Tracy. The 154-lap race began at 1:56p.m. local time; Bräck immediately took the lead, and Andretti went into second {{coming out of the}} first turn. They remained the top two in lap 20, with Dario Franchitti in third. Six laps later, Andretti passed Franchitti to reclaim second when the latter was unable to pass a slower car. Drivers near the lead begin making their first round of pit stops on lap 35, and continued doing so through lap 40. By lap 60, Bräck had built a lead of more than seven seconds. Carpentier had moved into second place, and Andretti, Tagliani, and Franchitti rounded out the top five. Bräck relinquished his lead on lap 64, when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> course while attempting to lap Junqueira. The first caution flag of the day came out, but not before Carpentier took the lead as Bräck regained control of his car and re-entered the track in second place. Pit stops took place during the caution, with Carpentier, Bräck, and Andretti still in the top three positions.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E
5|$|Seamer {{graduated}} in 1935, but returned to Oxford {{for a further}} year to study Arabic. In his final year of cricket at Oxford, he only appeared in three matches: he was not required to bat in either innings against the Free Foresters, and only batted once against Leicestershire, scoring 5 runs. Out of form and not required for the university team, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to play for Somerset in the match against Cambridge University and scored 68. He followed that with a further game for Somerset {{in which he was}} not successful and travelled with the Somerset side for the next match against Glamorgan at Llanelli, but Mitchell-Innes, as Oxford captain, called him up as cover for the injured Roger Kimpton; {{on the morning of the}} match, The Times reported that Kimpton was likely to play and Seamer would be stood down. In the event, Kimpton failed his fitness test and Seamer's final match for the university team was the University match against Cambridge, and as in the previous year, Oxford suffered a heavy defeat. Seamer scored 11 runs in the first innings, and then when Oxford were asked to follow on, he batted tenaciously to reach 43 runs, which forced Cambridge to bat again. Requiring 17 runs to win, Cambridge chased the total down in 5.4 overs with eight wickets to spare. In total, Seamer played 21 matches for Oxford, scoring 1,059 runs at an average of 35.30.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in overcast weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his first since the San Marino Grand Prix, with a time of 1:10.410. He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Coulthard who was three-tenths of a second off Häkkinen's pace. Coulthard felt he could have challenged for pole position but he clipped a kerb going into Castrol Kurve on his final run which cost him time. Both drivers were satisfied with their car's balance. Barrichello qualified third and said that he changed his car's set-up to help him to achieve a better lap time. Michael Schumacher qualified fourth, six-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, and reported that his car's handling was uneven throughout the circuit. He also had a high-speed spin during the session and aborted his final run after he made a mistake at the exit of Gösser corner. Trulli qualified fifth having used the soft compound tyres to set his fastest lap time. Zonta and Villeneuve set the sixth and seventh fastest times respectively for BAR, both drivers spun during the session. Fisichella recorded the eighth quickest time although he lost a bargeboard when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the circuit. He felt he could have secured fifth but a yellow-flag caused him to reduce his pace. Salo and Verstappen completed the top ten positions. Diniz missed qualifying in the top ten by two-thousands of a second and spun off while setting lap times, triggering a yellow-flag. de la Rosa managed twelfth, having struggled with the conditions during the session. He qualified ahead of Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld and Wurz. Frentzen, fifteenth, ran the hard compound tyres and his lap times were set early in the session before track conditions had improved. Frentzen said it was because he felt rain would hit the circuit towards the end of qualifying. Herbert started from sixteenth, after stopping on one run because to a broken left rear suspension caused by a loose suspension bracket at the Niki Lauda Kurve. A rear wishbone on his car had also been flexing. Alesi qualified seventeenth. Jenson Button used the spare Williams car set up for Ralf Schumacher because Button's race car had engine issues and qualified eighteenth. Button additionally struggled with driving the spare car. His teammate Ralf Schumacher qualified nineteenth in the Williams team's worst qualifying performance of the season. Burti and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} field, covering positions twenty to twenty-two.|$|E
