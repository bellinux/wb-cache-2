500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> <b>for.</b> Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, while {{awaiting}} {{the consequences of}} the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: [...] "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens." [...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E
500|$|Sibelius {{appears to}} have vacillated over {{a name for the}} new tone poem. By 3April 1914 he had dropped [...] in favor of [...] On 29April he wrote to Parker in favor of the {{original}} title ("Herr Doctor, now you must <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> performing the new tone poem in its final version with the original title [...] The version Aallottaret that I sent to you can stay with Mr. Stoeckel".). This position, too, proved fleeting. By the end of May, Sibelius had settled on , and the tone poem appeared under this title, albeit misspelled, on the 4June Norfolk Festival program: [...] " [...] —Tone Poem (Nymphs of the Ocean)". In preparation for the publication of the tone poem by Breitkopf & Härtel in June 1915, Sibelius included alongside the Finnish title, , an [...] "explanatory" [...] German translation, [...] (in English: The Oceanides). The piece was published as Op.73 and dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stoeckel.|$|E

500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 March, Yuri Kravchenko {{was found}} dead in a dacha in the elite {{residential}} area of Koncha-Zaspa, outside Kiev. He had died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds, though some speculated that he might have been assassinated to prevent him from testifying as a witness. Hryhory Omelchenko, who chaired the parliamentary committee that investigated the Gongadze case, told the New York Times that Kravchenko had ordered Pukach to abduct Gongadze on President Kuchma's orders. Kuchma himself has denied this allegation but has since been interviewed by investigators. Kravchenko left an alleged suicide note: “My dear ones, I am not guilty of anything. <b>Forgive</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> I became a victim of the political intrigues of President Kuchma and his entourage.

Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: [...] "To those who I love the most: Please <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the worst possible thing I could have done.

[...] This is {{indicated}} by [...] which says, [...] "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts." [...] Rabbi Isaac compared it to a person fitting together two boards, joining them one to another.

2500|$|The {{charge of}} the Heavy Brigade was {{anything}} but a charge – the brigade had launched uphill from a standing start, and the short distance between the two combatants had hardly allowed their horses to reach the trot. Moreover, the Russians were at last moving to meet them. [...] Scarlett was first into Ryzhov's cavalry, closely followed by his staff, and, initially, just three squadrons – two of the Scots Greys on the left, {{and one of the}} 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on the right, totalling 300 men. The first to feel the force of the British attack were the Ingermanland Hussars, under the command of Major General Khaletsky. Staff-captain Arbuzov later described how they [...] " [...] … had to fight with the regiment of Queen Victoria's Dragoon Guards in their red coats … Neither we nor the English wanted to yield." [...] A British Dragoon later described the action from his own perspective – [...] "They were so superior in numbers, they outflanked us, and we {{were in the middle of}} them … I hope God will <b>forgive</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> I felt more like a devil than a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and drug addict, served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at Florida State Prison for aggravated assault and battery stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident. [...] He was released on May 6, 2006, a week after her elimination from Idol. In an April 2006 interview with NBC Pickler said, [...] "One thing that's so important in life is we learn to forgive others.
