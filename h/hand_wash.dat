25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} food in Gullah {{communities}} {{and continues to}} be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.|$|E

40|$|University {{students}} may be at increased risk of infection because of {{living and working in}} close proximity to one another. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is widely considered the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious illness. Exploring the determinants of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> is vital to the development of interventions to increase this behaviour. A survey based on Social Norms Theory assessed <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and perceptions of peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> in 255 students at a Scottish University. Participants reported their own <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and rate, and how often they thought their peers <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> in particular circumstances, to determine whether misperceptions around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> exist in a UK student population, and whether these influence the behaviour of individuals. Gender was found to be a significant determinant of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency as females reported <b>washing</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more often than males. Participants also believed they <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more frequently than their peers. Perceived peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency was significantly correlated with participants’ own behaviour. This effect was seen in overall <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and in food, waste and illness-related <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> These results suggest perceived social norms around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> have a consistent and robust association with individual behaviour. An intervention based on Social Norms Theory may, therefore, be effective in increasing <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> in a student population, reducing infection spread and illness rates within this group. Future research might test the effectiveness of a social norms intervention in other settings which carry an increased risk of infection spread, for example schools, hospitals and care homes...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is {{the single}} most {{important}} and cost-effective method for prevention of diseases such as diarrhea among children and adults. Many interventions have been done in Tanzania focusing on primary care takers. Nevertheless, <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> proportion is still low. Hence more <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> promotion interventions are needed and for the behavior to be effective, proper <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> must be learnt from childhood so that it becomes a routine habit throughout life. Since, school children are good behavior change agents, this study focused on primary school children's <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> practice. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine factors influencing <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> practice among primary school children. Materials and methods: A cross- sectional analytical study based on quantitative research methods was conducted from June to July 2010 involving 527 grade five to seven primary school children of both sexes in Arusha rural district council using a pre- tested self administered questionnaire. Data analysis: Frequency distributions, Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed by SPSS version 13. 0. Results: Only 18. 8 % of participants fulfilled the criteria of <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> with soap, before eating, after using the toilet by using the required time. More than half (55. 7 %) of the children were aware of issues related to <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> practice. Only one school had <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> stations and none of the schools provided soap for <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> Bivariate analysis indicated that; significantly (p< 0. 001) higher proportion of children who perceived pressure from important referents (42. 1 %) <b>washed</b> <b>hands</b> as compared to those who did not perceive pressure (11. 5 %).

40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{technique for}} hand cleansing is critical, and except when hands are visibly soiled, alcohol based hand rubbing is recommended rather than soap and water. This presentation outlines an effective <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> technique and provides indications for when <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> should occur. The {{aim is to}} influence hand hygiene behaviour among nurses and encourage improved <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> Health care associated infections affect {{hundreds of millions of}} patients worldwide each year; resulting in serious illness, prolonged hospital stays and long term disabilities. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is easily the most modifiable measure to significantly reduce these infections and pathogen cross contamination. Despite extensive educational programs and literature on the significance of hand hygiene, and the improved availability of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> facilities, compliance among health care workers remains low. The result is that cross contamination and infection rates continue to remain high across all health care settings. All patient care activities can result in hand contamination, requiring regular <b>washing</b> of <b>hands.</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> should occur before and after procedures or patient care activities, when preparing medication or food, before commencement of shifts, when entering or leaving the ward, after removal of gloves and before handling sterile stock.

40|$|Significant {{global health}} {{attention}} and promotion {{has been focused}} on <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap due to the clear benefits observed in promoting and ensuring child health. However, the measurement and evaluation of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behaviours remains complex. The Sanitation, Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh Programme (SHEWA-B) is a large project being implemented by the Government of Bangladesh and UNICEF. This research assessed methodological issues of measuring <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behaviours through comparison of structured observation and responses to cross-sectional survey measures (spot-check observation, selfreported <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and a <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> demonstration) and discusses the suitability of indicators. Focus group discussions with fieldworkers were also conducted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behaviours were over-reported compared with structured observation findings. This implies that current estimates of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> from large scale surveys, for example, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are also likely to be overestimates. In about 1000 households, approximately 1 % or less of female caregivers were observed to <b>wash</b> their <b>hands</b> with soap or ash before preparing food, before eating, and 3 % before feeding a child. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> with soap was higher for defecation related events with approximately 29 % of female caregivers using soap two thirds or more of the time after cleaning a child’s anus/disposing of a child’s stools and 38 % used soap two-thirds or more of the time after defecation. Soap was observed at the <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> location in about 50 % of the households but actual practice was much lower. Reported knowledge was high; approximately 90 % identified the important times for <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> as being before eating and after defecation and approximately 50 % identified before preparing food and after cleaning/changing a baby. The measurement of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> is complex and there has been limited research into the validity of different measurement methods. This research used an epidemiological style approach using the concepts of screening/diagnostic testing and calculation of kappa statistics to assess validity. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that self report <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> measures are subject to over reporting. Structured observation provides useful information on directly observed <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behaviours and the frequency of behaviours. Spot check methods of soap and <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> locations also provide more optimistic data than observations and can be used as an alternative to structured observation. In addition, the use of questions on the 24 hour recall of soap and other self report questions on knowledge and the availability of spare soap demonstrate potential for use as potential indicators as an alternative to structured observation. Further validation of measurement methods is required in different country settings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many people fall sick {{because of}} {{infectious}} diseases transmitted through hands. Many of those diseases could be avoided through frequent <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> Trust in information from health authorities is important for compliance with recommended <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> behavior in times of a current public health threat. However, it remains uncertain if {{this is also the}} case in times of no current health threat. Aim: This thesis applies a social-cognitive model and examines social cognitive factors predicting <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and their relations to trust in authority-provided health information. Methods: Cross-sectional data from N= 140 young Finnish men aged 18 - 22 was collected in the Finnish army in 2011 to test the assumptions that, (1) trust in authority-provided health information is associated with higher knowledge, higher self-efficacy, higher perceived effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>washing,</b> lower perceived risk, and less disease worry; (2) Higher self-efficacy, higher knowledge, higher perceived effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>washing,</b> higher perceived risk, and higher disease worry is associated with more <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and to explore (3) whether there is a direct effect of trust in authorityprovided information on <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and whether it is mediated by self-efficacy, knowledge, perceived effectiveness of <b>hand</b> <b>washing,</b> perceived risk and disease worry. Results: The results show that trust in authority-provided health information is associated with higher self-efficacy, higher knowledge, higher perceived effectiveness and lower perceived risk; that higher self-efficacy and higher disease worry are associated with hand washing; {{and that there is a}} direct independent effect of trust in authorityprovided health information on <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> Furthermore, it was found that trust in authority-provided health information differs according to the educational level. Conclusion: The results are important to understand how certain social cognitive predictors of behavior are related to both, <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and trust in authority-provided health information, in times of no current health threat. The results give information for designing health intervention campaigns, which should address self-efficacy, disease worry and trust in authority-provided information.
