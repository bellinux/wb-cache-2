40|$|It {{is widely}} known that road traffic noise has {{negative}} influences on human health. Hence, as tire-road noise {{is considered to}} be the most dominant cause of road traffic noise above 30 - 50 km/h, a lot of research is performed by the two involving industries: road authorities/manufacturers and tire manufacturers. Usually, the parameters influencing <b>exterior</b> tire-road <b>noise</b> are often examined separately, whereas it is the tire-road interaction which obviously causes the actual noise. An integral approach, i. e. assessing possible measures to reduce tire-road noise from both the road and the tire point of view, is needed to further reduce traffic noise. In a project Silent Safe Traffic, this tire-road interaction is studied in more detail without focusing on either tire or road but looking at the tire-road system. In this publication we present experimental results of tire and road design parameters influencing tire-road noise from a fixed reference tire-road configuration. The influence of tire tread pattern, compound and construction as well as the influence of road roughness, acoustic absorption and driving speed on the <b>exterior</b> tire-road <b>noise,</b> measured by a CPX-set up, is reported.

40|$|Most {{frequency}} {{spectra of}} <b>exterior</b> tyre/road <b>noise</b> display a prominent {{peak in the}} range of 700 - 1300 Hz. This paper identifies and examines this peak, analyses its causes and suggests some noise reduction possibilities The characteristics of some of the spectra are such that it would suggest the need to make an adjustment according to ISO 1996 - 2 for pronounced tonal components. This quite unfortunate concentration of noise emission is caused by a multitude of coinciding factors which are described in the paper. It is argued that the causes for the phenomenon, termed the multi-coincidence peak, include characteristics such as tread pattern pitch, pipe resonances, tangential block resonances, belt resonances, the horn effect and road texture geometry. Elimination or modification of these frequency-concentrating factors, aiming at a mismatch of them, will be the key issue in order to effectively reduce tyre/road noise generation. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Interior {{noise is}} lower than {{conventional}} turboprop aircraft, because the propellers and engine exhausts are behind the cabin. Piaggio quotes 68 dBA. However, due to the strongly disturbed flow in which the pusher propellers operate, the <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> is higher. The <b>exterior</b> <b>noise</b> level and its higher pitched sound {{has been shown to}} be the result primarily of the interaction of the turbine engine exhaust flows and the five-bladed pusher propellers (est. +9 dB). On takeoff, the Avanti has been measured at 81.9 dBA sideline noise level, slightly lower than the Beechcraft King Air at 82.8 dBA. This is below FAA stage 3 noise limits, which set a maximum of 89 EPNdB for takeoff. However, the P180 has been the subject of noise complaints at airports, such as Aspen-Pitkin County Airport in Colorado as well as Naples Municipal Airport, Florida, where that airport authority determined it was the noisiest aircraft using the facility.

40|$|Tyre/road {{noise is}} a common problem in modern societies. A {{particular}} strong tyre excitation results from driving over transversal discontinuities in the road: e. g. potholes, pavement patching, tram rails, or bridge joints. Due to the transient nature of the excitation, the noise created by driving over these features is characterised by short peaks. While this often only causes a very limited increase in LpAeq, 24 h, LpA,max values at the discontinuity can be several dB higher than for the surrounding uninterrupted road surface. This leads to a higher annoyance of residents living close-by. A majority {{of the increase in}} LpA,max stems from the excitation of tyre air cavity resonances. These are normally of minor importance for <b>exterior</b> rolling <b>noise,</b> and are thus typically ignored in simulations. This study is based on a validated tyre/road noise simulation tool for rolling on real, continuous road surfaces. The tool is extended to include the air cavity and the structural-acoustical coupling. Tyre/road interaction is calculated for a tyre rolling over a bridge joint. The outcome of different simulation stages is compared to simulations for rolling over a continuous road surface, simulations for a tyre model without air cavity rolling over the bridge joint, and measurement results...|$|R
40|$|Cost-saving is an {{important}} factor in the transport sector. This includes production/acquisition and total lifecycle costs. Low energy consumption is one of the areas of cost-saving. Especially the usage of new materials and lightweight constructions is an interesting issue to reduce the energy consumption of trains. However, new construction concepts do need new acoustical concepts to preserve and/or improve the passenger comfort. To improve the understanding of the acoustic behaviour of trains, measurements are an essential issue. On the one hand measurements provide direct knowledge of the transferred acoustical energy and on the other the measured data is used to validate numerical simulations to get accurate and reliable results in the future. Various sources and source mechanisms play their part in the overall acoustical performance of trains. In the high-speed sector aeroacoustic source excitation is one of the most important sources. Nowadays <b>exterior</b> aeroacoustic <b>noise</b> can be measured in wind tunnels (scaled models). But for the measurement of the transmission from aeroacoustic noise sources into the passenger cabin, in-situ measurement techniques are needed. This concept for measuring aeroacoustic noise transmission will show how to determine the source, the response of the carriage and the noise radiation into the cabin. It has already been used on a DLR flight-test campaign and can be applied on high-speed trains, as well. ...|$|R
