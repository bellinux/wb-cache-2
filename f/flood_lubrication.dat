40|$|Modern era of mass {{production}} of holes with good surface finish and geometrical accuracy (cylindricity, roundness) {{is the basic}} requirement for precise assembly of different machined components. Even in today's industrial era, most of the machining operations are performed using <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> but <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> contributes to adverse health effect and safety issues, including toxicity, lung diseases to operator and air pollution, etc. Because of this mentioned issues the use of cutting fluid needs to be minimized and hence the Minimal Quantity Lubrication (MQL) technology was introduced. MQL is the process to apply minute amount of lubrication to the tool tip during machining. The lubricant is mixed with compressed air and forms aerosol mixture called as MQL. Conventional cutting fluids (<b>flood</b> <b>lubrication)</b> eliminate such problems as higher cutting temperature, tool wear and greater dimensional deviation. But, they possess {{a significant portion of}} the total machining cost. Thus machining under Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) condition has drawn the attention of researchers as an alternative to the traditionally used <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> with a view to minimizing the cooling and lubricating cost as well as reducing cutting zone temperature, tool wear, surface roughness and dimensional deviation. It was observed that the use of MQL technology resulted in decrease of overall cost by about 13 % and it is possible to achieve effective lubrication of cutting process with extremely small quantity of oil. The result is not only high productivity but also longer tool life and cost saving...|$|E

The type of cutting fluid used during machining play important role in enhancing the machining performance {{if and only if}} it is selected, applied, handled and disposed in better way.

It sometimes also becomes uneconomical; when application method, flow rate and cost of cutting fluid are remain unattended or underestimated. In Conventional <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> a large quantity of lubricant is applied continuously at the tool chip interface does not remove heat effectively as much required because of poor penetration and obstruction from the chip. Therefore this system is becoming uneconomical for machining and unsuitable for environment.

40|$|Abstract — Productivity {{and quality}} are {{critical}} issues in any manufacturing industry. In {{order to minimize}} the idle time associated with tool setups, estimation of tool wear is important.

However, {{there is an}} increasing concern with the <b>flooded</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems due to their biological and envi-ronmental impact {{as well as their}} maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environ-mentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces.

The experiments were performed on reciprocating ball-on-disk friction in GTL 8 base oil with and without MoDDP. In the <b>flooded</b> <b>lubrication</b> condition, the test results demonstrated {{that the presence of}} the MoDDP additive contributed to lower friction coefficients, and also more pronounced effect of surface textures on friction than {{in the case of the}} bare base oil.

The textured surface exhibited longer endurance time than the texture-free surface, especially when the MoDDP additive was used. The mechanism of the synergetic effects of surface textures and MoDDP additive has been discussed based on the experimental observations in the following sections.

40|$|Metal working fluids (MWFs) {{are one of}} {{the types}} of lubricants, which are {{extensively}} used in machining operations. Most of the MWFs are mineral oil based fluids.

40|$|Tool wear is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} in all metal cutting operations due to high friction at tool work interface, which affect the tool life, product quality and accuracy of work. For minimizing the friction at tool work interface the cutting fluids or lubricants are used for cooling and lubrication, hence improvement in machining efficiency. But if {{the quantity and quality}} of lubricants are unattended or underestimated then it creates problems like soil, water, environmental pollution and also makes the machining process uneconomical. The different cooling and lubrication techniques have been developed today. So it is necessity of present day scenario of machining to work with technology which would not degrade the environment, face the competition and have better quality of products. Different research shows that conventional <b>Flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> is limited by health hazards, misting and sometime uneconomical as compared to other techniques, due to its high discharge rate of fluid.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been suggested that the reduction in cutting forces obtained {{by the presence of}} fluids such as CC 1, on the backface or free surface of the forming chip was due to diffusion of the fluid into the body of the chip in the region of the shear zone. In the present work, experiments with carbon tetrachloride tagged with carbon- 14 and with carbon tetrachloride tagged with chlorine- 36 wtre performed with the object of assessing the extent of diffusion of lubricants into the chip when present on the free surface only. The results obtained disprove former hypotheses and suggest that the reduced cutting force is due solely to chemical reaction at the surface of the chip. Confirmation of the sensitivity of the surface of the deforming shear zone to change in surface condition was obtained by removing metal from this region by an electropolishing technique during slow speed cutting. By varying the electropolishing conditions increased or decreased cutting forces could be obtained. I t is proposed that the result both of chemical reaction at the surface and of surface removal is to reduce the strain-hardening rate of the metal undergoing shear by reducing the surface barrier to the flow of dislocations out of the metal. The association of the surface reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a change in the strain-hardening characteristics of the metal in the shear zone leads to a classification of the backface phenomenon as a Rehbinder effect and enables this effect to be more closely defmed than was hitherto possible. Evidence is also presented which indicates that the backface effect does not contribute to the reduction in cutting forces during rakeface lubrication and is therefore unimportant in practice where <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> of the cutting region invariably occurs...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. There is {{a growing}} global demand for titanium. The {{aircraft}} industry {{is the driving force}} behind the demand for titanium. The reason for this is that titanium has attractive properties that justify its use both economically and environmentally. Titanium alloys have superior strength-to-weight ratios. This implies that by substituting components manufactured from other metals in the aircraft with titanium components, a substantial reduction in structural weight can be achieved. From an economical point of view a lower mass implies lower fuel consumption. From an environmental point of view lower fuel consumption implies less harmful greenhouse emissions. Ti 6 Al 4 V components are the most widely used titanium alloy products in aircraft components. Ti 6 Al 4 V is known as a difficult-to-machine material. This is due to its low thermal conductivity and small contact area between the tool and the chips causing higher temperatures to be generated closer to the cutting edge of the insert. This will subsequently increase the rate at which the cutting tool wears. For this reason relatively low cutting speeds and feed rates are employed for the machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V compared to the machining of steels. Ti 6 Al 4 V is an exceptionally high cost material. The low cutting speeds and feed rates used in Ti 6 Al 4 V machining raises the machining cost of parts and contributes to an increase in the price of Ti 6 Al 4 V parts. By employing higher cutting speeds and feed rates machining times on Ti 6 Al 4 V products could be decreased, subsequently lowering the price for Ti 6 Al 4 V components. An increase in cutting speeds and feed rates will subsequently cause an increase in generated cutting temperatures, resulting in an increase in tool wear. This stresses the importance of controlling the cutting temperature during machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V in order to prolong tool life. The focus of this work was to investigate different lubrication strategies for polycrystalline diamond (PCD) and tungsten carbide inserts for Ti 6 Al 4 V milling operations in the quest to develop improved feasible cutting parameters. The results of this study showed that <b>flood</b> <b>lubrication</b> should be utilized for PCD inserts, while a “softer” 60 bar high pressure through spindle lubrication worked best for the tungsten carbide inserts. By utilizing these lubrication strategies, cutting speeds of 100 m/min and feeds per tooth of 0. 05 mm/rev for both the PCD and tungsten carbide grades could be attained with satisfactory tool life...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of friction and wear losses in boundary lubrication regime of a piston ring-cylinder liner tribo-system {{has always been}} a challenge for engine and lubricant manufacturers. One way is to use lubricant additives, which can form boundary film quickly and reduce the direct contact between asperities. This article focuses on the assessment of boundary film forming behavior of two phosphonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) as additives in engine-aged lubricant to further improve its film forming capabilities and hence reduce friction and wear of contacting surfaces. A reciprocating piston ring segment-on-flat coupon under fully <b>flooded</b> <b>lubrication</b> conditions at room temperature (approx. 25 °C) was employed.

Benchmark tests were conducted using fully formulated new lubricant of same grade (with and without ILs). Results revealed that the addition of phosphonium ILs to engine-aged lubricant led to quicker initiation of boundary film forming process. In addition, friction and wear performance of engine-aged lubricant improved by the addition of both ILs and these mixtures outperformed the fresh fully formulated oil.

Specimens were machined with new and worn out drills with 8. 6 mm diameter and (TiAl) N coating. Two levels of cutting speed and {{three levels of}} cooling/lubrication systems (<b>flooded,</b> minimum <b>lubrication</b> quantity, and dry) were used. The hole quality is evaluated on surface roughness (Ra) parameter, diameter error, circularity, and cylindricity error. A statistical analysis of the results shows that the cooling/lubrication system significantly affects the hole quality for all measured variables. This analysis indicates that dry machining produces the worst results. Higher cutting speeds not only prove beneficial to diameter error and circularity errors, but also show no significant difference on surface roughness and cylindricity errors. The effects {{of the interaction between}} the cooling/lubrication systems, tool wear, and cutting speed indicate that only cylindricity error is influenced.

40|$|Many {{different}} approaches {{have been used}} to prepare, store and test bone samples in order to determine its physical properties. The need to establish a standard method of specimen preparation and storage prior to experimental testing, contributed greatly to the primary part of this study. ^ When mechanized cutting tools such as saws and drills are used, heat is produced and this raises the temperature of both the tool and the material being cut. In orthopedic and dental practices, high-speed tools are often applied to bones and teeth, and heat from these operations may result in thermal necrosis [1]. Since this can {{have a negative impact on}} the outcome of an orthopedic procedure, temperatures must be kept below the threshold that results in bone necrosis. ^ The initial set of experiments was performed to determine the conditions under which the mechanical properties of the bone changed so as to establish the most suitable testing conditions. The hardness variation of the bone samples, under different annealing treatment conditions was used as the indicating parameter for evaluation of the change in the mechanical properties. Establishing the most appropriate section of the metacarpal sample for testing, by studying the anisotropy of the bone was another determining parameter. ^ The second step was to examine the effects of conventional drilling as well as modulation assisted drilling on the temperature rise generated in the bone during these machining processes. In addition to this, a set of experiments were performed to ascertain how lubrication affected the temperature rise during drilling. The dynamic portions of the torque and thrust traces as well as the specific energies were compared for the different drilling conditions. ^ Modulation showed no significant effect on the mean torque, thrust, specific energies of cutting, or temperature rise. <b>Lubrication</b> (<b>flooding</b> and misting) in both the modulation and no modulation cases drastically reduced the temperature rise during cutting, as expected. ^ In addition to this the characteristics of the chips produced by both the methods of drilling were compared. The modulation process produced more consistent chips at the lower speed (360 rpm) and as the speed was increased to 3000 rpm the chip formation was similar to the no modulation drilling condition at the same feed rates.

Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad. Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the <b>flooded</b> SO, directed <b>lubrication</b> reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|R
