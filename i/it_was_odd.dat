500|$|Felix Schoonen of Vampire Magazine said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> {{that the}} album was self-released by the band, asking, [...] "why should a band like Devourment release their own album... every week countless useless {{releases}} are thrown on the market by bands that nobody will ever care for and Devourment is somehow forced to release its own album." [...] In 2006, the band signed a two-album deal with label Brutal Bands, and proceeded to re-record and re-release Butcher the Weak. The new release's cover was yellow, while the self-released version sported a green cover, though they bore the same design.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor hears Donna {{scream and}} turns {{up in the}} booth. After {{examining}} the beetle, the Doctor comments on how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> for an alternate universe to form around her, explaining that the beetle worked for The Trickster with the job of changing people's lives in various ways. His remarks cause Donna to recall Rose and her message, which she delivers to the Doctor. Rose told her two words, [...] "Bad Wolf". A panicked Doctor, realising who Donna must have met, {{runs out of the}} room to find the words [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] written everywhere once again. He rushes into the TARDIS only to hear the cloister bell, and announces that the universe is in danger.|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd,</b> but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

500|$|MercyMe began {{recording}} the album over Christmas 2004, {{and put the}} [...] "finishing touches" [...] on it over the following summer. The band brought in rock producer Brown Bannister, who had previously recorded albums for artists like Amy Grant and Steven Curtis Chapman, to produce both The Christmas Sessions and their next studio album, which would also utilize a rock sound. In selecting songs for The Christmas Sessions the band wanted to cover Christmas songs they had grown up with, but they did write and record one original song, [...] "Joseph's Lullaby". Millard had initially written it as [...] "Mary's Lullaby" [...] but changed the lyrics and key upon suggestion from Bannister's wife, who noted that, being male, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> {{for him to be}} singing from the perspective of Mary as opposed to Joseph.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends {{wrote that}} the {{collection}} [...] "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available", and that for fans of the series, [...] "this collection is not for you" [...] as all games (with the exception of God of War III) are available for download, and it will [...] "likely be redundant." [...] However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> that the PSP games were included as downloads, {{and would like to}} have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a 4 out of 5 and called it [...] "an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood-drenched action–especially newcomers who get five titles for the price of one", but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection.|$|E
500|$|Solipskier was {{designed}} for the Adobe Flash platform. Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend had worked on Flash games earlier as Intuition Games. The idea for the game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed, and eventually Boxleiter [...] "blurted out with wide-eyes" [...] that the player could [...] "paint the terrain to determine {{the speed of the}} character". They chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night. Boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games (heightmaps from Dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from EON) to make a mockup within hours: a red ball that moved along with a slope (made with the mouse) and floated down slowly when suspended in air. He added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed, which was not apparent otherwise. Boxleiter then set up indicators to show the incoming gates, though he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> to have the indicators move to the right as the gate moved to towards the player (to the left). There was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase.|$|E

500|$|TV Week often {{commented on}} her {{pregnancy}} storyline. After the plot was half way through Erin Miller of TV Week said that Nicole {{had changed her}} mind about adopting her baby [...] "more times that Julia Gillard has uttered the phrase 'moving forward'". Upon watching Nicole's beach birth scenes, the magazine website editor quipped [...] "Who knew sand had birthing properties?! Well, maybe not... but you could forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting just thinking about it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Votta and Futterman {{both said}} that Sam and Mercedes sounded [...] "great together" [...] on [...] "Human Nature", and Futterman also complimented their {{individual}} voices—"hers restrained and soulful, his rock-tinged and raw"—and summarized, [...] "It's a crisp, well-executed cover". Most other reviewers also noted how good their voices sounded together, including Chaney, {{who gave the}} song a [...] "B−", and Bell, who called their harmonies [...] "out-of-this-world amazing". Lynch and Slezak each praised the tenderness in Riley's vocals; Lynch gave the song an [...] "A", and Slezak an [...] "A−". [...] "Ben", however, received far more mixed commentary, and several reviewers felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> to, as Chaney put it, sing a song about a rat [...] "to a guy who isn't named Ben and was wearing an eye patch", which Futterman called [...] "a little creepy" [...] and VanDerWerff, more bluntly, [...] "fucking weird". Despite this, Chaney gave the song a [...] "B", one of her highest grades of the night, {{in part because it}} gave Colfer [...] "an excuse to hit those 'You’ve got a friend in me' high notes", while Futterman noted that he [...] "does well in the high range", and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn. Bell, however, called the song [...] "a snooze-fest", and Slezak was very unhappy with the [...] "interminable rendition" [...] which he graded a [...] "D". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|Leading pro-establishment figures {{cast doubt}} on the mainland's {{supposed}} role in the disappearances: Ip Kwok-him said {{that it was possible to}} use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, Yiu Si-wing disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; Michael Tien said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; Wong Kwok-kin said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports. Regina Ip said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong. Ng Leung-sing, during a Legislative Council discussion, claimed to have received a tip from [...] "an old friend" [...] that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island (...) , an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes. The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as character assassination, were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item. Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name. Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.|$|E

James Greene of [...] put the sequence first on his list Ten Times The Simpsons Jumped the Shark, theorizing {{that it was only}} done for [...] "an Internet talking point the next morning", that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> for Lisa to be the focal point for the sequence and criticising the choice of song ("let's face it, Ke$ha is barely singing"). Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed her as number two of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.|$|E
2500|$|For many Europeans {{this new}} way of {{conducting}} warfare seemed ridiculous, {{so that in the}} beginning they were openly mocked. But the Dutch army continued to drill the volley under both Louis and his cousin Maurice, Prince of Orange, so that it became second nature. [...] One Dutch historian recounts the exercises in which regiments marched [...] "man by man bringing the rearmost to the front and the frontmost to the rear.… The beginnings were very difficult, and many people felt, because it was all so unusual, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> and ridiculous [...] They were mocked by the enemy, but with time the great advantages of the practices became clear … and eventually they were copied by other nations." [...] Soon the reorganized Dutch army displayed the virtues of the countermarch volley and the practice spread across Europe. An important component to the successful deployment of volley fire was the drill, which according to Geoffrey Parker, [...] "only two civilisation have invented drill for their infantry: China and Europe. Moreover, both of them did so twice: in the fifth century BC in North China and in Greece, and again in the late sixteenth century. Exponents of the second phase— Qi Jiguang in Imperial China and Maurice of Nassau in the Dutch Republic—explicitly sought to revive classical precedents, and in the West, marching in step and standing on parade became a permanent part of military life." [...] Drill was difficult {{and the manner in which}} the volley fire should be executed had not been perfected in Louis' time. It is clear from Holland's historical sources that it took many trials and experiments for the process to be refined.|$|E
