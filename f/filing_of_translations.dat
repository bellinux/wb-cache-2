40|$|The {{implications}} of any linguistic and non-linguistic research can be always {{of paramount importance}} when carefully and cleverly integrated within the scope <b>of</b> any interdisciplinary <b>filed</b> <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> study. The major goal of this paper, therefore, is to highlight and stress how a semiotic approach {{to the theory of}} meaning, in general, and to translation theory, in particular, can critically subsume the mere linguistic concerns of any prevalent semantic approach to translation. On the one hand, the former sets justifiable priorities that can more thoroughly cater for the dynamism of all textual, co-textual, extratextual, contextual and paratextual layers of the text as a fully-fledged sign within an overall sophisticated yet systematic macro order of signification; on the other hand, the latter usually may fumble and stumble whenever a text bears over-laden content of basic signifying elements that soar beyond the narrow limitations of lexical and sentential compositional structure. Thus, this paper advocates a strict semiotic approach to translation theory through which an array of semiotic annotations of the SLT must be aligned with and incorporated into basic morpho-syntactic notations, semantic denotations and sociocultural connotations.
