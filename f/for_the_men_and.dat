5|$|Opus Dei's highest {{assembled}} {{bodies are}} the General Congresses, {{which are usually}} convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses {{are made up of}} members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels {{were used for the}} rest of the harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E

25|$|The South {{was at a}} {{disadvantage}} in number, weaponry, and maritime skills; the region {{did not have much}} of a maritime tradition and few sailors.

25|$|The Maryland Legislature was {{controlled}} by farmers in rural counties who were short on labor and feared that education would draw blacks away from the farm.

The school also aimed to prepare black teachers.

Thirty minutes later, a hill [...] east of Saba was taken with sixty prisoners and three machine-guns. A short while later, Saba itself was captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns.

500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> the rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E

500|$|A pivotal {{experience}} for Kraft was {{the flight of}} Mercury-Atlas 5, which sent a chimpanzee named Enos on the first American orbital spaceflight carrying a live passenger. Coverage of these early missions that carried non-human passengers could often be tongue-in-cheek; a Time Magazine article on the flight, for example, was titled [...] "Meditative Chimponaut". Yet Kraft viewed them as important tests <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> procedures of Mission Control, and as rehearsals for the manned missions that would follow. Originally, the flight of Mercury-Atlas 5 had been intended to last for three orbits. However, the failure {{of one of the}} hydrogen peroxide jets controlling the spacecraft's attitude forced Kraft to make the decision to bring the capsule back to Earth after two orbits. After the flight, astronaut John Glenn stated that he believed a human passenger {{would have been able to}} bring the capsule under control without the need for an early re-entry, thus (in the words of Time Magazine) [...] "affirming the superiority of astronauts over chimponauts." [...] Yet for Kraft, the flight of Enos represented proof of the importance of real-time decision-making in Mission Control. It also gave him his first experience of the responsibility that he as flight director would have for the life of another, whether human or chimpanzee.|$|E
500|$|Although {{almost every}} story that {{appeared}} in Planet {{could be described as}} space opera, there was some variety of approach to the basic themes. [...] Earth was sometimes threatened, but more often the action took place on other worlds, bringing Earthmen into local conflicts. [...] This often involved beautiful native princesses, though the romantic storylines were stereotyped: in one story which appeared in Fall 1940, Carl Selwyn's [...] "Venus Has Green Eyes", the Venusian princess is dissuaded from her hatred of humans when the hero seizes her and kisses her; she slaps him, but succumbs to his charm. [...] Some respite from these depictions of women was provided by Leigh Brackett, who described her own heroines as [...] "usually on the bitchy sidewarm-blooded, hot-tempered, but gutty and intelligent" [...] (with [...] "bitchy" [...] intended as a compliment). [...] During World War II, it was in Planet Stories that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight, instead of merely being fought over. [...] Sex itself had long been taboo in the pulp magazines, but some stories in Planet depicted sexuality more directly than the competing magazines would. [...] The readers were not always accepting; one reader in a letter in 1949 supported [...] "jettisoning the taboos", but a letter writer in 1946 objected to [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", saying that he needed [...] "a pint of Listerine to wash the dirty taste out of my mouth". [...] The cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well, with what sf author and critic Harry Harrison sardonically referred to as [...] "sexual dimorphism in space": heavy, functional spacesuits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> transparent suits through which bikinis or swimsuits could be seen for the women.|$|E
