40|$|In the 1990 s, {{scientists}} at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggested that artificially enhancing turbulent diffusion <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> improves {{the representation of}} two important aspects of weather forecasts, i. e., near-surface temperatures and synoptic cyclones. Since then, this practice has often been used for tuning the large-scale performance of operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, although it is widely recognized to be detrimental for an accurate representation of stable boundary layers. Here we investigate why, 20 years on, such a compromise is still needed in the ECMWF model. We find that reduced turbulent diffusion <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> improves the representation of winds <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> boundary layers, but it deteriorates the large-scale flow and the near-surface temperatures. This suggests that enhanced diffusion is still needed to compensate for errors caused by other poorly represented processes. Among these, we identify the orographic drag, which influences the large-scale flow {{in a similar way}} to the turbulence closure for <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, which partially controls the near-surface temperatures. We also {{take a closer look at}} the relationship between the turbulence closure <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> and the large-scale flow, which was not investigated in detail with a global NWP model. We demonstrate that the turbulent diffusion <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> affects the large-scale flow by modulating not only the strength of synoptic cyclones and anticyclones, but also the amplitude of the planetary-scale standing waves...|$|R

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} (LES) {{are used}} to investigate the effect of stable stratification on rural-to-urban roughness transitions. Smooth-wall turbulent boundary layers are subjected to a generic urban roughness consisting of cubes in an in-line arrangement. Two line sources of pollutant are added to investigate the effect on pollutant dispersion. Firstly, the LES method is validated with data from wind-tunnel experiments on fully-developed flow over cubical roughness. Good agreement is found for the vertical profiles of the mean streamwise velocity component and mean Reynolds stress. Subsequently, roughness transition simulations are done for both neutral and <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> Results are compared with fully-developed simulations with conventional double-periodic boundary <b>conditions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{at the end of}} the domain the streamwise velocity component has not yet reached the fully-developed state even though the surface forces are nearly constant. Moreover, the internal boundary layer is shallower than in the neutral case. Furthermore, an investigation of the turbulence kinetic energy budget shows that the buoyancy destruction term is reduced in the internal boundary layer, above which it is equal to the undisturbed (smooth wall) value. <b>In</b> addition, <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> pollutants emitted above the urban canopy enter the canopy farther downstream due to decreased vertical mixing. Pollutants emitted below the top of the urban canopy are 85 % higher <b>in</b> concentration <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> mostly due to decreased advection. If this is taken into account concentrations remain 17 % greater <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> due to less rapid internal boundary-layer growth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Near-fatal asthma (NFA) is {{characterized}} by severe asthma attacks usually requiring intensive care unit admission. This phenotype of asthma has been studied mainly in acute conditions. METHODS: The aim of our study was to compare the clinical, functional and inflammatory characteristics of NFA patients with mild to severe asthmatics <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> We recruited 155 asthmatic patients from five centres of the European Network for Understanding Mechanisms of Severe Asthma: 67 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma controlled by low/medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids; 64 with severe asthma that, despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta 2 -agonists and for 1 / 3 also with regular oral corticosteroids, {{had at least one}} asthma exacerbation in the previous year; 24 with an NFA episode in the previous 5 years in the absence of inclusion criteria for the previous groups. All the patients were examined <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> RESULTS: NFA patients were taking less corticosteroids and were less compliant to prescribed asthma medications than the other two groups of patients. Lung function, blood gases, atopic status, sputum and blood inflammatory cell count of NFA patients were similar to mild-to-moderate, but not severe, asthmatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: <b>In</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> patients with an NFA attack in the previous 5 years cannot be distinguished from patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, while they are different from severe asthmatics both in terms of lung function and of airway inflammation. The risk factor that characterizes this group of patients is reduced usage of prophylactic corticosteroid...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown {{the elevation of}} serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) and soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in patients with bronchial asthma during asthma attacks. In the present study, we extended our earlier study by measuring serum sVCAM- 1 levels by ELISA in 45 patients with bronchial asthma (23 atopic and 22 non-atopic) during asthma attacks and <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>in</b> order to assess further the state of adhesion molecules in allergic inflammation of bronchial asthma. The levels of sVCAM- 1 in sera obtained during bronchial asthma attacks were higher than those in sera obtained <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> These findings were observed regardless of atopic status. To examine the regulatory mechanism in the elevation of serum sVCAM- 1 levels, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by ELISA. TNF-alpha levels in sera obtained during bronchial asthma attacks were higher than those in sera obtained <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> The nature of change in serum TNF-alpha levels correlated {{with the nature of}} change in serum sVCAM- 1 levels, but serum TNF-alpha levels did not correlate with serum sVCAM- 1 levels. These results suggest that higher levels of sVCAM- 1 during asthma attacks may reflect the up-regulation of VCAM- 1 expression in allergic inflammation, and that a soluble form of VCAM- 1 molecules may be useful markers for the presence of allergic inflammation. TNF-alpha is shown to enhance the expression and release of VCAM- 1 in vitro, however; the regulatory mechanism in the elevation of serum sVCAM- 1 levels remains to be clarified...|$|R

This comparison shows significant discrepancies and supports earlier results showing that surface fluxes, in the limit of high stability, are not adequate scalings for mean profiles. The most evident differences are found for cases for which the bulk Richardson number turns out to be quite large. One of the practical consequences is that boundary-layer height diagnostic formulations that mainly rely on surface fluxes are in disagreement with those obtained by inspecting the thermodynamic profiles recorded during the radiosounding ascent.
