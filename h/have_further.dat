5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles <b>have</b> <b>further</b> expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must <b>have</b> <b>further</b> fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G.

The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would <b>have</b> <b>further</b> limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E

In this eventuality he is alleged to <b>have</b> <b>further</b> hoped to establish an SS Province of Holland in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men. However this claim was shown to be a myth by Loe de Jong in his book Two Legends of the Third Reich.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would <b>have</b> <b>further</b> jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, <b>have</b> <b>further</b> revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E

5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would <b>have</b> <b>further</b> increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 {{was considered to be}} easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable and easy to maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process <b>have</b> <b>further</b> simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.|$|E

As a result, some critics consider the radio show to be a spin-off of the TV programme, and some <b>have</b> <b>further</b> ventured that The Museum of Curiosity {{is not as good}} as its forerunner. Most reviews of The Museum of Curiosity, however, are positive.|$|E

5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would <b>have</b> <b>further</b> disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to <b>have</b> <b>further</b> unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{is leading}} the Spartan army in a rampage across Greece. During the campaign, he is {{attacked}} {{by a number of}} beasts led by Argos, who was sent by the gods to stop Kratos. After a series of skirmishes, Argos is killed by an unknown assassin, who frames Kratos in an attempt to turn the gods against him. The Spartan pursues his foe across Greece to discover the identity of the assassin, but is slowed by constant attacks from the minions of Hades, the God of the Underworld. Zeus sends Ceryx to deliver a message to Kratos: stop the relentless pursuit and take heed of the destruction already caused. Kratos, however, battles and kills Ceryx, which inadvertently allows the assassin to escape. Kratos then realizes his actions <b>have</b> <b>further</b> alienated the gods, and Zeus will soon act in response to his defiance.|$|E

After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They <b>have</b> <b>further</b> fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
