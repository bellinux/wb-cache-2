50|$|The MRB Z1013 (Mikrorechnerbausatz = mikro{{computer}} kit) was an East German Single-board computer {{produced by}} VEB Robotron Riesa which was primarily intended for private use and educational institutions. It was {{powered by a}} U880 processor (a Z80 clone) and sold together with a membrane (flat <b>foil)</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Initially, the kit was equipped with 16-KByte DRAM, which was later replaced by a 64-KByte version.|$|E
40|$|DE 102009051829 A 1 UPAB: 20110519 NOVELTY - The switch (100) has two {{opposite}} contact surfaces (102, 104) {{separated in}} an opened {{state of the}} switch by spaces (108) filled with an insulating fluid (106) i. e. insulating liquid. A fluid reservoir (110) is fluidically connected with the spaces for delivering the insulating fluid in case of displacement of the fluid reservoir by mechanical pressure on the fluid reservoir at the spaces such that the switch is changed from a closed state into the opened state. The switch is designed such that a contact of the contact surfaces in the closed state represents an energetically stable state. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing an electrical switch. USE - Electric switch {{for use in a}} chip card (claimed). Can also be used for a smart label, <b>foil</b> <b>keyboard,</b> electronic data paper and an electronic-ticket. ADVANTAGE - The switch can be designed with small or flat dimensions, so that utilization of the switch on the chip card, smart label or the <b>foil</b> <b>keyboard</b> is ensured...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} supports a multi-level view of visual word recognition incorporating representations at an intermediate level where multiletter units can be activated directly by supraletter features (e. g. Drewnowski & Healy, 1977). In the present study, priming in an alphabetic decision task was exploited to investigate the existence of directly activated multiletter units. Subjects were required to make a discrimination response to test stimuli that could be targets or foils. Targets were single letters or consonant-bigrams that were present or absent in an immediately preceding word, and <b>foils</b> were single <b>keyboard</b> characters or a character plus a letter. Experiment I verified an earlier finding that responses to consonantbigrams are facilitated when they appear in a prime word, whereas responses to the constituent letters of those bigrams are not facilitated (Greenberg & Vellutino, 1988). In addition, responses to primed bigrams were faster than responses to primed single letters. Experiments 2 to 4 revealed that bigram priming in the absence of letter priming occurs only when both primes and targets appear in lower-case type. It is concluded that separable multiletter units are represented in the visual word recognition system and are directly activated by supraletter visual features. The findings are discussed in the context of current theories of visual word recognition...|$|R
