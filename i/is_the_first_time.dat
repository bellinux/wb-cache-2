In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984.

For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development.

5|$|With {{the opening}} of its Whopper Bar {{locations}} in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported {{that it would be}} the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase.

The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is a practical one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
