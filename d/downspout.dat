5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A <b>downspout</b> {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel's general contracor, Hensel Phelps Construction Co., {{alleged that}} Cooper Carry Inc., the hotel's {{architect}} of record, failed to property design the structure. Hensel Phelps identified 20 areas of concern, which included below-grade structures, ceiling materials, door hardware, duct work, the gutter and <b>downspout</b> systems for entrance canopies, the smoke control system, stairwells, {{the tops of}} walls in guestrooms, windows, and more. Hensel Phelps also claimed that Cooper Carry failed to perform its work {{in a timely manner}} (forcing the contractor to miss deadlines) and violated basic [...] "standard of care" [...] obligations. The two parties engaged in mediation, but were unable to come to an agreement. [...] In October 2015, Hensel Phelps filed an $8.5 million lawsuit against Cooper Carry in federal court.|$|E
2500|$|Smaller tanks, such as {{the plastic}} 208-litre (55-gallon barrel) are also used in some cases. Modern modular systems which are scalable, like the 193 litre (51 gal) Rainwater HOG module and the 500 litre (133 gallon) Stratco Aquabarrel {{can be used to}} decentralize the {{rainwater}} catchment by storing smaller volumes at each <b>downspout.</b> [...] Larger tanks are commonly used where there is no access to a centralised water supply. Companies such as Solar Survival Architecture recommend [...] a 300-gallon (1135 litre) tank for a house supporting 2 people (if compost toilets are placed) and if your region receives 762mm of precipitation a year. If it receives less (between 254mm and 762mm), 2 or 3 of these 300 gallon tanks can be placed (so that more rain can be gathered at times when it does rain). Also affecting tank size is predicted rainfall and rainfall variability; the higher prices for larger tanks; intended use of rainwater and typical consumption for these uses; the area of roof draining into the tank; security of supply desired.|$|E
25|$|Leaking gutters and <b>downspouts</b> {{can cause}} serious {{damage to a}} building's {{interior}} and exterior. Copper {{is a good choice}} for gutters and <b>downspouts</b> because it makes strong leak-proof joints. Gutters and <b>downspouts</b> made with copper are expected to outlast other metal materials and plastics. Even in corrosion-prone seacoast environments or in areas with acid rain or smog, copper gutters and <b>downspouts</b> can provide 50 years or more of service.|$|R
5000|$|Gutters and <b>downspouts</b> {{are used}} to catch rain water as it falls and to {{discharge}} it away from houses and buildings. When gutters are clogged or <b>downspouts</b> are broken, rainwater is absorbed by the soil near the foundation, increasing hydrostatic pressure.|$|R

50|$|Among {{noteworthy}} Lustron exterior {{features are}} the siding consisting of square segments of material, {{followed by a}} zig-zag <b>downspout</b> trellis on the buildings' front and rear corners. In the two-bedroom Westchester models, the <b>downspout</b> attaches via the trellis to a pillar that supports the open porch. Rust has often led to removal of the trellis by owners.|$|E

50|$|At 7 Jermain, {{the house}} is {{parallel}} to the street. The porch has been similarly enclosed and the windows replaced with double-hung sash. Its paneling is Maize Yellow, and the zigzag <b>downspout</b> is still present. Additions have been made to the rear, and a detached concrete block garage has been built. Neither are considered contributing. The additions were slightly damaged in a 2009 fire. Across the street, 8 Jermain, in Desert Tan, retains many original features, but not the zigzag <b>downspout.</b>|$|E

50|$|Placement of {{heat trace}} cable on roofs or in gutters to melt ice during winter months. When used in gutters the cable {{is not meant to}} keep the gutters free of ice or snow, but only to provide a free path for the melted water to get off the roof and down the <b>downspout</b> or drain piping.|$|E
5000|$|Rain chains (鎖樋, kusari-toi or kusari-doi, {{literally}} [...] "chain-gutter") are {{alternatives to}} a <b>downspout.</b> They {{are widely used}} in Japan. Their purpose is largely decorative, to make a water feature out of the transport of rainwater from the guttering downwards to a drain or to a storage container. (Rainwater is sometimes collected for household usage.) They {{can also be found}} on temples.|$|E
5000|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} {{for residential}} use {{can be achieved}} easily by placing a tank underneath a <b>downspout</b> outside the home.

In Canada, the regulations and legislation are still being developed for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse (water used for laundry, showers and sinks [...] ).|$|E
50|$|The sima {{runs around}} all four {{sides of a}} building.

25|$|Today, {{architectural}} copper {{is used in}} roofing systems, flashings and copings, rain gutters and <b>downspouts,</b> building expansion joints, wall cladding, domes, spires, vaults, {{and various}} other design elements. Simultaneously, the metal has evolved from a weather barrier and exterior design element into indoor building environments where it is changing the way commercial and residential interiors are decorated.|$|R
50|$|Copper is {{a valued}} {{building}} material {{because of its}} advantageous properties (see: Copper in architecture).
