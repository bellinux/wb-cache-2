5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>having</b> some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in walking about", [...] "I have some problems in walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> for 1, <b>having</b> some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (<b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R

In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a black belt in Judo learned Taekwondo under a Hell's Kitchen martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the Mother Superior, also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and that they have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> with the surrounding neighborhoods. Their story was ultimately picked up and reported by The New York Times.|$|E

Grace had played here in 1873–74 {{on an open}} space covered with stones, but 97 years later the wicket was 'hard, well-prepared and {{exceptionally}} good'. It was not a limited overs match, each side played one innings and could declare. Peter Lever, Alan Ward, Brian Luckhurst, Don Wilson and John Hampshire dropped six easy catches between them before Hutchinson sportingly declared on 146/9.

25|$|Australia thus gave India {{a target}} of 199 in 23 overs. The Indian openers however, started {{extremely}} badly, {{with both of them}} getting out in successive balls to Nathan Bracken, giving him a chance of bagging a hat-trick on his test debut. The match came alive after that and VVS Laxman the next batsman, avoided the hattrick by squirting the ball through gully. Thereafter, India <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> absolutely, as Rahul Dravid and Laxman took the score to respectability with Dravid dominating the partnership, scoring 43 only off 47 balls, while Laxman charmed his way on to a breezy 24.

500|$|After awakening, {{the crew}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the mission's third spacewalk, one that was considered the most challenging and uncertain, yet {{had some of the}} highest priority items scheduled. The tasks were to remove the obsolete Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), originally installed during STS-61 to correct the spherical aberration of Hubble's mirror, and install the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), and to repair the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). [...] The ACS failed in June 2006 due to an electrical issue, and after being restored partially, failed again in 2007 due to an electrical short. The ACS was not designed to be serviced or repaired in space, so the task was {{considered one of the most}} challenging of the mission. After running into various snags in the first two spacewalks, managers on the ground were prepared to see unexpected issues arise during the complicated repair work. The spacewalk began at 13:35 UTC, and Grunsfeld and Feustel <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems.</b> The pair worked through their timeline so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead at one point. After removing COSTAR and stowing it in the orbiter's payload bay, they installed COS, and then moved on to the ACS repair. Using specially designed tools, they removed an access panel, replaced the camera's four circuit boards, and installed a new power supply.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{demographic}} and social network variables, independently of each other, are associated with quality of life (QoL), self-rated health or physical function. The sample consisted of 307 women aged 75 years. Social networks were assessed by Fillenbaum’s five questions and a question on ability to participate in organizations. Variables of demographic composition, QoL, health and physical function were registered. We found significant associations between social networks, QoL, health and physical functioning. Seeing friends and relatives as often as wanted, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with higher QoL. Higher educational level, the ability to see friends and relatives as often as wanted and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with better health. Living alone, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations indicated better mobility. Being younger, having higher education and <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations were associated with better balance. Higher scores on muscle strength were associated with being younger, not living alone and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations. Our results highlight the importance of social networks for maintaining good QoL, health and physical functioning...|$|R
