5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E

25|$|While {{other plants}} contain the protein chains found in ricin, both protein chains must {{be present in}} order to produce toxic effects. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> that contain only protein chain A, such as barley, are not toxic because without the link to protein chain B, protein chain A cannot enter the cell and do damage to ribosomes.|$|E
25|$|Principal plant {{communities}} {{within the}} Preserve include the dominant California oak woodland savanna, and also consist of chaparral, marsh, native Bunch grass, douglas-fir woodland and riparian woodland. Within the oak woodland the {{main tree species}} are Coast live oak, Oregon oak, California black oak, Canyon live oak and California bay laurel. The woodland understory exhibits toyon, coffeeberry, poison oak and, in the higher exposed areas with ecotones to chaparral, containing chiefly coyote brush. This community sometimes gradates to small grassland savannas between the oak groves, which are rich with grasses and annual wildflowers. <b>Example</b> <b>plants</b> in this community are the yellow hayfield tarweed, Hemizonia congesta spp. congesta and the hayfield tarweed, Hemizonia congesta spp. luzulifolia, which are seen blooming in the late autumn.|$|E
25|$|Various {{scientific}} disciplines have developed taxonomic classification systems to describe natural phenomena or individuals, like for <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> or animals. These systems {{are based on}} specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction. Differently, in landslide classification, there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable; usually being characterised by different causes, movements and morphology, and involving genetically different material. For this reason, landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors, sometimes very subjective. In the following write-up, factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups: {{the first one is}} made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined. The second one is formed by those factors that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions.|$|E

50|$|As in the First Way, {{the causes}} Aquinas {{has in mind}} are not {{sequential}} events, but rather simultaneously existing dependency relationships. For <b>example,</b> <b>plant</b> growth depends on sunlight, which depends on gravity, which depends on mass. Aquinas is not arguing for a cause that is first in a sequence, but rather first in a hierarchy: a principal cause, rather than a derivative cause.|$|R
2500|$|Why would {{individuals}} ever leave {{high quality}} source habitat for a low quality sink habitat? This question {{is central to}} source-sink theory. [...] Ultimately, {{it depends on the}} organisms and the way they move and distribute themselves between habitat patches. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> disperse passively, relying on other agents such as wind or water currents to move seeds to another patch. Passive dispersal can result in source-sink dynamics whenever the seeds land in a patch that cannot support the plant's growth or reproduction. Winds may continually deposit seeds there, maintaining a population even though the plants themselves do not successfully reproduce. Another good example for this case are soil protists. Soil protists also disperse passively, relying mainly on wind to colonize other sites. As a result, source-sink dynamics can arise simply because external agents dispersed protist propagules (e.g., cysts, spores), forcing individuals to grow in a poor habitat.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen) - a bluescreen will be used if the subject is predominately green (for <b>example</b> <b>plants),</b> despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.|$|E

25|$|Teeth {{are among}} the most {{distinctive}} (and long-lasting) features of mammal species. Paleontologists use teeth to identify fossil species and determine their relationships.

50|$|A {{problem with}} {{defining}} land degradation {{is that what}} one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity.

50|$|A chimera is {{an animal}} or plant that has {{two or more}} {{different}} populations of genetically distinct cells that originated in different zygotes that have merged; anatomical structures are typically mixed depending on which cells are prevalent in different body parts, for <b>example</b> <b>plants</b> can have {{two different types of}} flowers.|$|E
50|$|For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> use {{water as}} {{electron}} donor to biosynthesis, being lithotrophs.

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} {{is the lack of}} an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms [...] "recycle" [...] the wastes of other organisms, for <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.|$|E

50|$|Gametogenesis is a {{biological}} {{process by which}} diploid or haploid precursor cells undergo cell division and differentiation to form mature haploid gametes. Depending on the biological life cycle of the organism, gametogenesis occurs by meiotic division of diploid gametocytes into various gametes, or by mitotic division of haploid gametogenous cells. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is {{also referred to as}} alternation of generations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{population}} dynamics and population ecology, overshoot {{occurs when a}} population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. [...] The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off {{in which there is}} a decline in population density. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed 'overshoot-and-collapse'.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is confused. Several of the species are very similar, {{and the number of}} species recognized as distinct varies significantly from one source to another. For <b>example,</b> <b>plants</b> occurring in Crete have {{at one time or another}} been put into three species: C. albescens, C. cretica and C. nana. Sfikas' Wild flowers of Crete recognizes only two of these (C. cretica and C. nana); the Natural History Museum's checklist of the Cretan Flora recognizes only one (C. nana, as Scilla nana). The Royal Horticultural Society distinguishes between C. forbesii and C. siehei; other botanists recognize only C. forbesii.|$|E
5000|$|To {{separate}} ecologically suitable species, {{different methods}} can be used. Environmental niche modelling {{can be applied}} for {{a large number of}} species.
