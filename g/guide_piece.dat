40|$|Abstract:- By {{analyzing}} {{the structure and}} motion characteristics of the flexible guide system of the projectile-feeding chain of a small-bore naval gun, a mathematical model of three-dimensional space attitude dynamic simulation for the flexible guide is proposed; also the corresponding dynamic simulation software is developed. Through which the position of each <b>guide</b> <b>piece</b> in the flexible guide can be determined when the naval gun’s rotating and pitching angle of fire is of any degree. Then the friction force between the projectile-chain and the flexible guide can be calculated according to each guide piece’s position and projectile-chain’s moving velocity and the friction factor. Consequently the automation’s load can be determined. The result of computing can be the criteria to the automation’s designing parameters. Moreover, it is significant to study the adaptive technology of the raise-feed system of the small-bore naval gun...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to provide {{elementary}} school teachers {{with a variety of}} ideas to be implemented in the study of language arts. This project {{is in the form of}} a resource guide that consists of twenty separate book <b>guides</b> for <b>pieces</b> of juvenile literature that were nominated for the Young Hoosier Book Award in 1997 - 1998. These book guides provide pertinent information-bibliographic data, topics found in each book, summaries of these popular children's stories, suggested language arts activities, biographical sketches of the authors, and related readings. The activities suggested in the book guides are divided into categories to support the reading process. Each guide contains ideas that incorporate all of the language arts-reading, writing, speaking, listening, and viewing/visually representing. Also each guide includes questions designed to prompt thinking. However, these lists are by no means all that can be done with each piece of literature. They are merely recommendations. The related readings that have been included are grade level appropriate for the grade levels listed. However, it should be noted that the readability of the works and the level of the learning experiences listed in the book guides are not necessarily appropriate for all students in a class and/or for all grade levels listed. As is true in any instructional situation, the developmental abilities of each individual student in the class must be taken into consideration before lessons can be implemented.

5000|$|To use it, a {{sheet of}} paper is placed on a heavy {{cardboard}} backing, and one of the plastic pieces—known as a stator—is secured via pins or reusable adhesive to the paper and cardboard. Another plastic piece—called the —is placed so that its teeth engage with those of the pinned piece. For example, a ring may be pinned to the paper and a small gear placed inside the ring. The number of arrangements possible by combining different gears is very large. The point of a pen is placed in one of the holes of the rotor. As the rotor is moved, the pen traces out a curve. The pen is used both to draw and to provide locomotive force; some practice is required before the Spirograph can be operated without inadvertently disengaging the stator and rotor, particularly when using the holes situated {{near the edge of the}} larger rotors. More intricate and unusual-shaped patterns may be made through the use of both hands, one to draw and one to <b>guide</b> the <b>pieces.</b> It is possible to move several pieces in relation to each other (say, the triangle around the ring, with a circle [...] "climbing" [...] from the ring onto the triangle), but this requires concentration or even assistance from other people. Pens of various colors were frequently included with the sets, or one could obtain them elsewhere, to add texture and color to the design by switching colors in a set pattern or a random fashion, as seen in the image above.|$|R
40|$|Euphonium concertos {{and similar}} masterworks for {{euphonium}} have been recorded, written about, analyzed, and discussed at length numerous times in recent years. Unfortunately, {{the most frequently}} studied and performed euphonium solos have been almost completely ignored in this regard. These works are useful for performance by the undergraduate-level euphonium player. Solos in this category are played by strong high school players and undergraduate euphonium students all over the world. These solos receive countless performances and {{play a crucial role}} in the development of young euphonium players, yet have never received attention in the form of a published pedagogical <b>guide.</b> The <b>pieces</b> of greater difficulty and substantial length have received more attention for obvious reasons, but solo pieces most useful for the developing euphoniumist need to be analyzed and discussed on a pedagogical level. This paper is a pedagogical guide to commonly played euphonium solos by the undergraduate level student. The three pieces used in this study are Sonatina by Warner Hutchison, Sonata for Unaccompanied Euphonium by Fred Clinard, and Lyric Suite by Donald White. Pertinent background information about each piece is presented in order for the reader to understand the historical context in which it was written. A list of relevant information and minimum performance skills (instrumentation, length, range, articulation skills, etc.) are included for each selection. An analysis of particular sections of each piece are presented for the reader to adequately grasp concepts and practice ideas that are explained, although the bulk of analysis is of a pedagogical nature. The main body of the paper focuses on assisting the reader with ways to approach this solo literature in daily practice as well as effective performance ideas. Particularly troublesome areas of each piece are identified and strategies to overcome common pitfalls and performance errors are noted...|$|R
