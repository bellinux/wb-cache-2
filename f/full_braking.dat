2500|$|The {{first officer}} {{called for the}} arming of the {{spoilers}} one second after touchdown, and the commander armed them half a second later. Two seconds later the first officer called [...] "no spoilers" [...] as the spoiler indicator light had not switched on. He then verified the hydraulic pressure and that the switch was set correctly. Meanwhile, the commander had switched the thrust levers from flight idle to ground idle, and six seconds after touchdown activated the wheel brakes. From 12.8 seconds after touchdown various screeching sounds can be heard from the tires. The braking took place nominally until halfway down the runway. From this point the pilots reported that nominal retardation did not occur. The commander attempted to use the brake pedals to apply <b>full</b> <b>braking,</b> without effect. He then moved the brake lever from green to yellow and subsequently emergency brake, disconnecting the anti-lock. Witnesses observed smoke and spray emitted from the landing gear.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve.

5000|$|If {{the system}} {{identifies}} an emergency, it automatically initiates <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> {{more quickly than}} any driver can move his or her foot.

50|$|The Volvo system Collision Warning with Auto Brake 'CWAB' uses a radar {{to detect}} when a {{collision}} is likely and will pre-charge the brakes {{so that when}} the driver uses the brakes, however lightly, <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> is applied. The system will also flash a light and make a warning sound. If the driver does not respond to the warning at the point where a collision cannot be avoided the system will apply the brakes automatically and dramatically reduce the speed of the collision.|$|E

5000|$|On April 22, 2014, the NHTSA {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into 60,000 2014 Chevrolet Impala models over concerns relating to the sedan's emergency braking system. This followed the NHTSA receiving a complaint from a driver who experienced [...] "inappropriate activation of the emergency braking system," [...] adding it [...] "alleges that the driver assist system inappropriately activated emergency braking bringing the vehicle to a complete stop under what the driver considered to be <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> force." [...] The driver also {{went on to say}} that he heard three to four beeps from the system while driving the rented vehicle, which had only 2500 miles on it.

50|$|Some all-steel {{coaches were}} {{introduced}} in 1925-26. These were open thirds and brake thirds, together {{with a large number}} of <b>full</b> <b>brakes,</b> which were built by outside contractors, probably to assist the steel industry at that time. Construction apart, however, their two-window style and interior layout showed no advance on the other coaches of the time while externally they were finished in a pseudo fully beaded style.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} of {{the second}} train survived the crash, and claimed {{he had not seen}} the signal in sufficient time to stop his train. Investigation showed that even if he had missed the yellow light going on, warning him to slow down in anticipation of a red, he still had space to stop the train had he applied his <b>full</b> <b>brakes</b> at the red. As a result, the ICC decided {{the time had come to}} force the issue of train control.|$|R
50|$|The S80 is {{available}} with optional Adaptive cruise control (ACC) with Collision Warning with <b>full</b> <b>Brake</b> Support (CWBS). Brake Support offers additional assistance by preparing {{the braking system}} so that the car can begin stopping faster and preparing for panic brake application. S80 is also equipped with an adaptive brake light as standard which is active at speeds above 30 mph, and can sense the difference between normal and panic braking. Ready Alert Brakes (RAB) are also available to anticipate severe braking. It prepares for this by moving the brake pads closer to the discs.|$|R
50|$|Another benefit was {{initially}} unexpected. Braking effect is greatly reduced at high speeds; {{the coefficient of}} friction between a tyre and concrete is about 0.7 to 1.0 at 30 mph, but decreases dramatically to 0.3 to 0.5 at 120 mph. This means that {{it is much easier}} to skid when first landing, a fact that led pilots to hold off on the brakes until the aircraft was firmly down, and then slowly increase pressure to avoid skids. With Maxaret, they simply applied <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> as soon as they touched down, knowing that the system would prevent skids. As a result, braking distances even in perfect conditions were greatly improved, on the order of 30%. A later modification allowed the brakes to be applied before landing, with the valve only applying the brakes when the wheel spun up at least once.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} CLK chassis is used, {{and while}} the current version {{is not based on}} the new C-Class platform, the AMG version of the CLK offers some special undercarriage components. The four-wheel independent suspension is basically the same as the lesser CLK versions, but AMG fits higher-rated springs, tighter shock valving, larger diameter anti-roll bars and stiffer suspension bushings. The resulting firmer, more controlled ride is made even tighter by its high-performance ZR-rated low-profile tires. The brakes have been enhanced as well. The huge four-wheel discs are larger and thicker than the other CLKs, and the rear discs are specially vented to enhance cooling. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is standard, while Brake Assist applies <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> force in panic stop faster than a driver could. It rides on AMG Monoblock alloy wheels, 7.5" [...] front and 8.5" [...] rear, shod with 225/45ZR17 and 245/40ZR17 Michelin Pilot Sport tires.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes-Benz has {{traditionally}} introduced its safety innovations in the S-Class. For instance, the S-Class {{was the first}} car in Europe to incorporate airbags and three point seatbelts. S-Class safety features included innovations in active safety (accident avoidance), passive safety (collision protection), and holistic safety (integration of both active and passive safety features). Active safety features include: ABS braking in 1978 (acts to reduce braking distances and improve stopping control; co-developed with Bosch); traction control and Electronic Stability Program (ESP) in 1995 (improves driver control during difficult road conditions); and Brake Assist (provides <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> power during emergency stops). In 2005, a new infrared night vision feature was introduced (improves visibility during nighttime conditions). Despite the popular misconception, the S-Class {{was not the first}} car fitted with ABS braking technology, although some credit can be given for popularizing this now largely standard feature (ABS was initially an option on most models of the W126 S-Class). Active lane keeping became standard in 2011.|$|E

50|$|A {{distant signal}} {{is one that}} cannot display a 'danger' aspect. It is however able to display a 'caution' aspect, which gives the driver advance warning that the stop signal ahead may be {{displaying}} 'danger'. The distant signal is installed roughly at <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> distance on approach to the stop signal to which it applies, {{taking into account the}} gradient, the permitted speed, and the braking performance of trains. On sighting a 'caution' aspect, the driver must prepare to stop at the signal ahead. If the distant signal shows a 'clear' aspect, the train may maintain full speed. A single signal may be equipped to function both as a stop signal and a distant signal. Some distant signals are {{in the form of a}} 'fixed distant'. That is: they only ever display a 'caution' aspect and never a 'clear' one. Such signals are usually in the form of a standard distant arm fixed in the horizontal position to the signal post. An alternate form is a picture of a horizontal distant arm painted onto a white board.|$|E
5000|$|First {{production}} Audi with a Collision avoidance system: Pre sense (similar to Mercedes-Benz Pre-Safe). The full {{version of}} the system (Pre Sense Plus) works in four phases. In the first phase, the system provides warning of an impending accident, while the hazard warning lights are activated, the side windows and sunroof are closed and the front seat belts are tensioned. In the second phase, the warning is followed by light braking, strong enough to win the driver's attention. The third phase initiates autonomous partial braking {{at a rate of}} 3 m/s² (9.8 ft/s²). The fourth phase decelerates the car at 5 m/s² (16.4 ft/s²) followed by automatic deceleration at <b>full</b> <b>braking</b> power, roughly half a second before projected impact. A second system, called (Pre Sense Rear), is designed to reduce the consequences of rear-end collisions. The sunroof and windows are closed and seat belts are prepared for impact. The optional memory seats are moved forward to protect the car's occupants. The system uses sensor fusion with twin radar and a mono camera and was introduced in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Distant {{aspects that}} {{announce}} 'halt' or 'proceed with low speed', like Vr 0, Vr 2, Ks 2, Hl 10 etc., are normally (except for repeaters) {{accompanied by an}} activated 1000 Hz magnet of the PZB train safety system. Passing it triggers hidden timers in the vehicle's part of the PZB system, which first checks that the driver acknowledges the distant signal, then it supervises the braking. If the acknowledgement does not occur in time or if, at any point, the system detects that the train´s speed exceeds the limits of a certain braking profile, it engages <b>full</b> <b>brakes</b> and enforces a stop of the train.|$|R
5000|$|Pre-Safe with {{pedestrian}} {{detection and}} City Brake function Thanks to {{the combination of}} stereo camera and radar sensors, {{it is now possible}} to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicle. Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted by BAS PLUS as the situation requires, right up to a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> application. Should the driver fail to react, PRE-SAFE® Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. The PRE-SAFE® Brake with pedestrian detection is active up to approx. 72 km/h, and is able to prevent collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to 50 km/h.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：The <b>full</b> power {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> {{system has}} several advantages over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of <b>full</b> power hydraulic <b>brake</b> system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a hydraulic brake valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of <b>full</b> power hydraulic <b>brake</b> system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a <b>full</b> power hydraulic <b>brake</b> system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of <b>full</b> power hydraulic <b>brake</b> system dynamics...|$|R

50|$|Early on 10 February 1935, {{an empty}} {{electric}} passenger train was travelling from Ringwood to Croydon, prior to running a service from Croydon to the city.

The crews of both trains suffered minor injuries and the Croydon fire brigade quickly extinguished a fire which had broken out.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} classifying (inferring) the emergency braking situations in road vehicles from the motion pattern of the accelerator pedal. We trained and compared several classifiers and employed genetic algorithms to tune their associated hyperparameters. Using offline time series data {{of the dynamics of}} the accelerator pedal as the test set, the experimental results suggest that the evolved classifiers detect the emergency braking situation with at least 93 % accuracy.

5000|$|... for {{the same}} reason, on a very long train, a {{considerable}} volume of air has {{to be admitted to}} the train pipe to make a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> application, and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to release the brake (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly lowered and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons {{at the head of the}} train have responded to the brake application or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train. In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.|$|R
