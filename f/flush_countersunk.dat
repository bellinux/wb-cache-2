50|$|Rivets need to {{be harder}} than the {{materials}} being joined, they are heat treated to various levels of hardness depending on the materials ductility and hardness. Rivets come {{in a range of}} diameters and lengths depending on the materials being joined; head styles are either <b>flush</b> <b>countersunk</b> or pan heads.|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} rivet heads was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without rivet heads or one with perfectly <b>flush</b> <b>countersunk</b> rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size rivet heads but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The rivet heads investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the rivet heads investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the rivet head. The order of merit in regard to low resistance is <b>flush</b> <b>countersunk,</b> oval countersunk (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|E
5000|$|During the {{industrial}} age, iron strakes {{were replaced by}} a solid iron tyre custom made by a blacksmith, who first measured each wheel to ensure proper fit. Iron tyres that were always made smaller than the wheel in circumference, expanded by heating in a fire then placed on the wooden wheel and quenched quickly with water to shrink it onto the wood, then fastened to the wooden wheel by nails or tyre bolts. Tyre-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to break off because they were <b>flush</b> finished and <b>countersunk</b> into the wheel's outer surface also allowing for wear without wearing the bolt head away. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century, the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs and other factory-made wood, iron and rubber wheel parts became increasingly common. Companies such as Henry Ford developed manufacturing processes that soon made the village wheelwright obsolete. With the onset of two world wars, the trade soon went into decline and was very rare by the 1960s and almost extinct by the year 2000. However, owing to the efforts of organisations like the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, wheelwrights still continue to operate in the UK.|$|R
