5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
500|$|In {{a second}} {{shooting}} incident, a miner walked into Chafin's sheriff office in Logan and, without a word, {{shot him in}} the chest. [...] Chafin walked the two blocks to Logan General Hospital with a bullet lodged in his chest two <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|E
50|$|Standing high as {{the legendary}} Mount Meru, Anand Krishna wavers not an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> course of action, {{in spite of all}} kinds of trials and turbulences.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you're the man I want to see," [...] she {{asserted}} {{and took}} a step forward. But he did not move an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> position and his eyes were fixed steadfastly on her face.|$|R
5000|$|General John P. Abizaid, head of US {{forces in}} Iraq, visited US Representative John P. Murtha (D-Penn.) in Murtha's office {{and held up}} his index finger {{about a quarter of}} an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> thumb, telling Murtha [...] "We're that far apart" [...] on Iraq policy.|$|R
500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
2500|$|Kenji is Hisao's {{neighbor}} in the dorms, who is legally blind, {{being unable to}} see {{anything more than a}} few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. He appears to be a hikikomori and very anti-social, claiming to be the [...] "last sane man in an insane world." [...] He often rants about feminist conspiracy theories, claiming that feminists are evil and want to rule the world (these feelings are revealed to stem from his feeling tired after having intercourse with his ex-girlfriend a year before the story starts), among other pointless subjects, possibly rivaling Rin's [...] "uniqueness" [...] in that aspect. Kenji's route is the bad ending of Act 1 if the player does not choose one girl to befriend over the course of Act 1.|$|E
2500|$|Rapier was {{promoted}} to Sergeant-Major of the battalion, in which capacity he fought in the Battle of Williamsburg and in the Seven Days battles. During the Battle of Frayser's Farm, June 30, 1862, part of the Seven Day's campaign, he was blinded temporarily by a shell exploding <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face. In August, his battalion was divided and his company became Company E of the Confederate States Zouave Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers. On August 12, this organization became part of Starke's Brigade of Taliaferro's Division. Rapier continued to serve as sergeant major. He then saw action at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Battle of Antietam and Fredericksburg, before his battalion was transferred to southeastern Virginia. In January, he {{was promoted}} to first lieutenant and adjutant of his battalion. In March, it is reported that Secretary Mallory offered him a commission in the Confederate Marine Corps, but Rapier did not initially accept it. However, several weeks later he took the examination, passed and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, dated July 11, 1863.|$|E
50|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Bender {{served in}} the United States Navy during World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart, having been wounded in {{an attack on a}} {{fortified}} Japanese position in New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands. The bullet remained in <b>his</b> body, an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> left hip, all his life.|$|R
30|$|We had {{to stand}} there and stare at this man, hardly more than a boy, buried alive under a hill of rubble, with death barely an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chest, and {{miraculously}} still alive. All we could do was marvel; all of us, we marveled, for {{there was not a}} man amongst us who had seen a thing like that before (Ghosh 2005 a, 241).|$|R
5000|$|Ashley {{engineered}} {{the first version}} of the piece using live electronics and reactive computer circuitry. He recorded his vocal part himself, with the mic barely an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth and the recording level just shy of feedback. He then added [...] "subtle and eerie modulations" [...] to the recording, modifying his voice to the point that much of what he read could not be understood.|$|R
2500|$|In their {{penultimate}} {{debate on}} August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over {{the actions of}} the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the ongoing convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the U.S. during the Second World War [...] "some people were pro-Nazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [...] don't care because you have no sense of identification with—". Vidal then interjected that [...] "the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself," [...] whereupon Smith interjected, [...] "Now let's not call names." [...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." [...] The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary Best of Enemies.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Waring {{brought his}} hand down with a bang on the table, causing Mr. Wilberfloss to leap a clear two <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|E
60|$|Drummond backed to the door, {{with the}} red iron a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face, {{and when he had}} gone the smith signed to Driscoll.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "gentlemen, I shall say 'Are you ready?' and on {{receiving}} {{no answer}} shall fire; but mind I am determined that {{if either of}} you makes a move to turn, or raises his arm {{by as much as}} an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> side before he hears the shot I will shoot him down at once. Do you both understand that?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one course open to him now, {{and that was to}} cut his way out with his hatchet. Before {{beginning}} to act he unstrapped his bundle and sat down to eat, having previously relieved Attim of his load and given him some food. Everything he did had to be done by feeling, for he could not see his hand even when held only an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
60|$|Mat's {{resolution}} was taken {{the moment he}} caught sight of her. He never stirred an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> place of concealment, until she had advanced three or four paces into the room, and had her back turned full upon him. Then quietly stepping a little forward from the door, but still keeping well behind her, he blew out her candle, just as she was raising it over her head, and looking down intently {{on the floor in front}} of her.|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{down and}} tried {{one of the}} keys from his bunch. Virginia did not hesitate. She pulled the trigger of her revolver, and a bullet whistled only a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head. He sprang upright in a minute.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam!" [...] ejaculated Captain Bird, {{the hand}} {{which had been}} holding his pipe a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth now {{dropping}} to his knee; and at this motion the hands which held the pipes of the three other mariners dropped to their knees.|$|E
60|$|This was {{too much}} for Ole Ericsen. At sight of his beloved {{paintwork}} thus defaced, he jumped up and shook his fist at the fishermen; but a second bullet smashed into the cabin not six <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head, and he dropped down to the deck under cover of the rail.|$|E
50|$|In Ultimate War, Thor {{appears as}} a member of the Ultimates, {{retrieving}} the dead with Iron Man after the attack in issue one. When Magneto attacks the Ultimates, he says he is surprised to see Thor with the Ultimates, and asks him if he thinks he can change them. Thor throws Mjolnir at the Master of Magnetism, but Magneto manages to stop it an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> helmet and throws it back at Thor, sending him through a wall. Thor joins the Ultimates in attacking the X-Men later on; he fought Storm but is defeated by Colossus.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Ybarra {{consulted}} defendant Dr. Tilley, who diagnosed appendicitis {{and made}} preparations for surgery. Ybarra entered the hospital, {{was given a}} hypodermic injection, slept, and was awakened. He was wheeled into the operating room, where his body was pulled {{to the head of}} the table. His back was laid against two hard objects at the top of his shoulders, about an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck. Prior to the operation, he had never had any pain in his arm or shoulder, but afterward, he felt a sharp pain in his neck near the shoulder and was unable to rotate or lift his arm.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Raggett {{withdrew his}} pipe and holding it an <b>inch</b> or two <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth, listened like {{one in a}} dream.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suit me excellently,' {{said the}} stranger, 'five precisely--till then--care of yourselves;' and lifting the pinched-up hat a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head, and {{carelessly}} replacing {{it very much}} on one side, the stranger, with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket, walked briskly up the yard, and turned into the High Street.|$|E
6000|$|But his elation did not {{lift him}} many <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> standing-place, {{to which he}} came down again on the instant, causing the boards of the crazy old coach-roof to crack {{with the weight of}} his joy. [...] "Hurray, hurray!" [...] he bawled out, [...] "Podasokus is the horse! Supper for ten, Wheeler, my boy. Ask you all round of course, and damn the expense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, that's it!' {{said the}} yeoman, {{bringing}} {{his hand down}} {{on the back of}} his uncle's chair with a loud smack, at which Uncle Benjy nervously sprang three <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> seat and dropped into it again. 'Ask your pardon for frightening ye, uncle. 'Tis how we do in the army, and I forgot your nerves. You have scarcely expected to see me, I dare say, but here I am.' ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{carefully}} examining the foolscap, {{upon which the}} words were pasted, holding it only an <b>inch</b> or two <b>from</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|R
2500|$|... 18 September 1990: the IRA {{attempted}} to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, in which capacity he signed the documents allowing the SAS to operate against IRA volunteers in 1988. The revenge attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window, hitting him at least nine times and injuring his wife, Lady Betty, near the eye. The couple's daughter, Elizabeth, was found suffering from shock. Peter Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face, and two high-velocity bullets lodged {{a fraction of an}} <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brain.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 September 1990 the Provisional Irish Republican Army {{attempted}} to kill Terry {{at his home}} in Main Road, Milford, Staffordshire. The attack took place at 9 pm, while Terry was sitting reading. The shooter(s) opened fire through a window, hitting him at least nine times. His wife, Betty, Lady Terry, was also shot and injured, near her eye. The couple's daughter, Liz, was found suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets lodged a fraction of an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brain. The then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said that she [...] "was utterly appalled and deeply grieved" [...] by the shooting.|$|R
60|$|He {{made one}} {{desperate attempt to}} pull out on the trail. But the moment he left the {{protection}} of the fire, the boldest wolf leaped for him, but leaped short. He saved himself by springing back, the jaws snapping together a scant six <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> thigh. The rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him, and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance.|$|E
6000|$|On a soft grassy spot, {{close to}} the {{warbling}} stream, lay our friend Peterkin, on his breast, resting on his elbows, and the forefinger {{of his right hand}} raised. Before him, not more than six <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> nose, sat the most gigantic frog I ever beheld, looking inordinately fat and intensely stupid. My memory instantly flew back to the scene on the coral island where Jack and I had caught our friend holding a quiet conversation with the old cat, and I laughed internally as I thought on the proverb, [...] "The boy is the father of the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{except for}} two or three minutes, when that bloodthirsty scoundrel Biassou came upon the scene with a hundred and fifty of his followers. There was very nearly a shindy then, but it passed off; for he did not like looking down the muzzle of my pistol at a few <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head, and my four men made him a {{prisoner}} until affairs had taken a friendly turn, which was not long after. For when the leader of a party is a prisoner, and his guards have orders to shoot him instantly if there is any trouble, it is astonishing how quick people are in coming to an understanding." ...|$|E

50|$|With an embouchure {{like that}} {{used for a}} brass instrument, the {{musician}} holds {{the mouth of the}} jug about an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> or her mouth and emits a blast of sound, made by a buzzing of the lips, directly into it. The jug does not touch the musician's mouth, but serves as a resonating chamber to amplify and enrich the sound made by the musician's lips. Changes in pitch are controlled by loosening or tightening the lips. An accomplished jug player might have a two-octave range. Some players augment this sound with vocalizations, didgeridoo style, and even circular breathing. In performance, the jug sound is enhanced if the player stands with his back to a wall, which will reflect the sound towards the audience.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, McCain {{screamed at}} Senator Richard Shelby an <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> face, during a heated cabinet {{nomination}} battle for McCain's friend John Tower. [...] In 1992, McCain and Senator Chuck Grassley {{got into a}} heated argument, with shoving and profanities, over a POW/MIA committee issue and did not {{speak to each other}} for two years, before reconciling. At a meeting in 2007 on immigration legislation, fellow Republican Senator John Cornyn objected to McCain: [...] "Wait a second here. I've been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day. You're out of line," [...] to which McCain replied, [...] "Fuck you! I know more about this {{than anyone else in the}} room." ...|$|R
