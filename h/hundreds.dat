5|$|An earlier {{administrative}} and political {{function of the}} area was {{to serve as a}} core area for one of the three provincial things that together elected the king of Denmark. The first Danish administrative sub-divisioning occurred as part of the centralization process, when the area became divided into administrative units called <b>hundreds</b> (herreder in Danish). The <b>hundreds</b> were possibly based on older, already existing units, but the establishment of the new form of <b>hundreds</b> was prompted by an increase in royal power during the High Middle Ages. These differed from the provincial thing areas in that they were not local communities joined under a governing assembly but top-down regional divisions established to ensure royal authority. These medieval Danish <b>hundreds</b> were used to implement military obligations and to expedite the collection of renders due to the king in the provinces. They were first established in Jutland, where they replaced previous administrative units called syssel. According to some scholars, they were introduced in Skåneland possibly as early as the 11th century.|$|E
