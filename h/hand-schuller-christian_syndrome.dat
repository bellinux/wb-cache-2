40|$|Two {{cases of}} Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) expressing as <b>Hand-Schuller-Christian</b> <b>syndrome</b> with diabetes insipidus, hyperprolactinemia and empty sella are here reported. Up-to-date this four-fold association {{is lacking in}} world literature and it is here discussed in the light if LCH is a cancer or the clinical expression of an immunologic disorder...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} Letterer-Siwe, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, and eosinophilic {{granuloma}} of the bone, {{and the evolution}} of the concept of grouping them together under the common term of histiocytosis X are presented. The characteristics of the disease, with particular emphasis on oral manifestations, are reviewed. The therapy for the disease is briefly outlined. One case of <b>Hand-Schüller-Christian</b> <b>syndrome</b> is presented. The discussion is focused on the problem of chemotherapy in disseminated forms...|$|E
40|$|Histiocytosis of Langerhans cells (class 1 histiocytosis) {{consists}} {{of a range of}} clinical manifestations, including bone eosinophilic granuloma, <b>Hand-Schüller-Christian</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and Letterer-Siwe disease. These syndromes represent a spectrum of severity and prognosis of an underlying disorder which is usually sporadic. This report describes three cases in one family, who developed the disease a few years after their brother was discovered to have histiocytosis. All three patients had the same clinical manifestations. They had hyperthermia, eczematic rash, swelling in skull, hand and foot. Radiological data included lytic areas in the skull and fourth metacarpal. Serology for Epstein-Barr infection was negative. Infiltration of abnormal Langerhans cell histiocytes was demonstrated upon bone biopsy. Chemotherapy was administered. One case (male) died after a year of chemotherapy. In another case (female) chemotherapy was unsuccessful, but T-cell suppressor (cyclosporin) induced remission. In the third case (female), chemotherapy was successful...|$|E
30|$|Langerhans-cell {{histiocytosis}} is a {{rare disease}} involving clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells [1, 2]. It {{is part of a}} group of clinical syndromes called histiocytoses, which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of histiocytes (an archaic term for activated dendritic cells and macrophages). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, such as leukemias and lymphomas. The disease, previously known as histiocytosis X, was renamed in 1985 by the Histiocyte Society as Langerhans-cell histiocytosis because of the proliferation of Langerhans-cells. The spectrum includes localized-to-bone eosinophilic granuloma, and the rare multisystem <b>syndromes</b> <b>Hand–Schüller–Christian</b> disease and Abt–Letterer–Siwe disease; the manifestations range from isolated bone lesions to multisystem disease [1, 2].|$|R
