50|$|There was a {{historic}} footpath {{through the fields}} connecting West Keal and Keal Cotes formalised by the Enclosure Act of 1750, much used by villagers heading for the West Keal Parish Church. The footpath was annexed for its entire length by the Air Ministry in 1941, as it passed across the perimeter track of RAF East Kirkby, with a <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> that the footpath's right of way would be reinstated as and when the airfield ever closed. However an administrative error by a junior Air Ministry clerk in 1965 resulted in the footpath being sold as several parcels of land by tender {{to a number of}} local farmers and subsequently plowed up for agriculture. Several campaigns to reopen the original footpath for public leisure use over the last 40 years, but opposed by the influential landowners, have so far failed as no local residents were still alive to attest they had regularly walked the path before 1941. Law changes regarding countryside access encompassed by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 mean that unless the path can be included on the definitive map by 1 January 2026 it will cease to be a right of way in perpetuity.|$|E
30|$|The {{standard}} methodological rules {{apply in}} {{the estimation of}} Models (1) and (2). Estimating {{the likelihood of a}} <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> a divestiture requires a binary variable as the dependent variable, calling for a conditional logistic regression as the estimation strategy in Model (1). By contrast, since performance is often measured using a continuous variable (e.g., Tobin’s q, return on equity), Model (2) can typically be estimated using a standard linear model. It is often useful to include firm and year fixed effects in these models, especially when panel data is being utilized, since this soaks up the unobserved heterogeneity (attributable to firm- or time-specific characteristics) that could be affecting performance. In both models, it is also necessary for researchers to account for any methodological challenges that might impair their estimation, including multicollinearity, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity.|$|E

The analysis reveals that external research and development do not affect product innovation and the combined effect of internal and external knowledge on product innovation {{is greater than the}} separate effect of these types of knowledge on product innovation. Furthermore, external knowledge acquisition and firm spending on internal research and development facilitates product innovation more effectively for older firms and firms in the services sector than for relatively younger firms and firms in the manufacturing sector.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{standard}} analysis of vertical relationships transposes directly to investment dynamics. Thus, when a <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> a project requires an outside supplier (e. g., an equipment manufacturer) to provide it with a discrete input to serve a growing but uncertain demand, and if the supplier has market power, investment occurs too late from an industry standpoint. The distortion in firm decisions {{is characterized by a}} Lerner-type index. Despite the underlying investment option, greater volatility can result in a lower value for both firms. We examine several contractual alternatives to induce efficient timing, a novel vertical restraint being for the upstream to sell a call option on the input. We also extend the model to allow for downstream duopoly. When downstream firms are engaged in a preemption race, the upstream firm sells the input to the first investor at a discount such that the race to preempt exactly offsets the vertical distortion, and this leader invests at the optimal time. These results are illustrated with a case study drawn from the pharmaceutical industry. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{find that}} Chinese trade flows respond to {{economic}} activity and relative prices [...] {{as represented by}} a trade weighted exchange rate [...] but the relationships are not always precisely or robustly estimated. Chinese exports are generally well-behaved, rising with foreign GDP and decreasing as the Chinese renminbi (RMB) appreciates. However, the estimated income elasticity is sensitive {{to the treatment of}} time trends. Estimates of aggregate imports are more problematic. In many cases, Chinese aggregate imports actually rise in response to a RMB depreciation and decline with Chinese GDP. This is true even after accounting for the fact a substantial share of imports are subsequently incorporated into Chinese exports. We find that some of these counter-intuitive results are mitigated when we disaggregate the trade flows by customs type, commodity type, and the type of <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> the transactions. However, for imports, we only obtain more reasonable estimates of elasticities when we allow for different import intensities for different components of aggregate demand (specifically, consumption versus investment), or when we include a relative productivity variable...|$|E
40|$|Working paper GATE 2011 - 18 In a {{real option}} model, {{we show that}} the {{standard}} analysis of vertical relationships transposes directly to investment timing. Thus, when a <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> a project requires an outside supplier (e. g., an equipment manufacturer) to provide it with a discrete input to serve a growing but incertain demand, and if the supplier has market power, investment occurs too late from an industry standpoint. The distortion in firm decisions {{is characterized by a}} lerner-type index, and we show how market growth rate and volatility affect the extent of the distortion. If the initial market demand is high, greater volatility increases the effective investment cost and results in lower value for both firms. Vertical restraints can restore efficiency.

Otherwise, if two downstream firms are engaged in a preemption race, the upstream firm sells the input to the first investor at a discount which is chosen {{in such a way that}} the race to preempt exactly offsets the vertical distortion, and this leader invests at the optimal time...|$|E
40|$|We {{have entered}} the “New Normal” economy, with more {{emphasis}} on economic growth driven by innovation than resource. This paper investigates the impacts of firms considering corporate social responsibility and environmentally sound technology by building a three-stage Cournot competition model with asymmetric cost. The sustainable development of economic and endogenous firm growth achieves the win–win result in the theoretical model. Using data from 31 firms in China, this paper empirically researches on the relationships among corporate social responsibility, environmentally sound technology and firm endogenous growth. The results show that: (1) Marginal cost decreased {{with the increase of}} innovation, as well as getting government research and development subsidy, which has a positive effect on firm growth. (2) Consumers respond positively to corporate social responsibility initiative, the reputation of the firm can be improved. At the same time, environmentally sound technology objectively reduces the marginal cost of competitors because of the technology spillover. (3) Profit of a <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> corporate social responsibility partly decreases, which has a negative effect on firm growth. The contradiction between corporate social responsibility and profit of firm could be adjusted, such as socially responsible investment fund hosed by institutional investors...|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} {{explanation of why}} outsourcing relationships are inherently dynamic, in that the dependence of each party upon the other inevitably changes over time and thus so too will the power asymmetries between the parties. Methodology/approach Our approach is theoretical and draws upon insights from resource dependence theory, transaction cost economics, and the resource-based view of the firm, {{to focus on the}} power asymmetries between the focal <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> the outsourcing and its suppliers. We illustrate our arguments using a longitudinal case study of the evolving relationship between Apple and the Foxconn Technology Group. Practical implications For supplier firms, the message is to upgrade, develop distinctive resources and capabilities, and diversify the customer base. Otherwise, suppliers will forever be condemned to low operating margins and the threat of being replaced by cheaper, more agile rivals. For focal firms, the message is not to rest on your laurels. The potency of isolating mechanisms may well dissipate, suppliers will no doubt strive to lessen their positions of dependence and competitors will inevitably emerge, with the result that once-profitable outsourcing arrangements may quickly erode. Originality/value We highlight the crucial role played by isolating mechanisms to underpin power asymmetries in outsourcing relationships, and thus enable focal firms to appropriate the rents from externalized value chain activities. We argue that the efficacy of many isolating mechanisms will tend to dissipate over time as competitors emerge to imitate successful strategies and products, and as resource and capability asymmetries erode...|$|E
40|$|An {{index was}} {{developed}} to rank U. S. metropolitan areas according to overall similarities in their socio-economic characteristics to the U. S. average. This index is given {{as a solution to}} matching a representative city or market area to a target market as well as matching a group of cities which are similar to each other. The index shows stability in ranking these cities with different consumption data for similar products and proves to be a promising approach whenever the researcher must find a group of cities which are similar {{to each other and to}} the target market. Market research sometimes requires selec-tion of cities or market areas for testing new product performance, effects of changes in different market variables on product sales, effects of changes in different economic var-iables on product consumption, and so on. This type of research uses representative markets as proxies for a target market area in order to get meaningful information [Shoraka, R. ]. A relatively large sample size and repetitive market research are needed to obtain precise results; however, the larger the sample size, the greater are research costs [Ladik, et al. ]. In many cases, the cost of increasing the sample size (number of cities) is not justifiable or may be prohibitive to the small <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> the analyses [Lipstien, B. ].

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{holistic}} approach to the evaluation of an ocean renewable energy (ORE) technology type or specific project {{in order to provide}} a comprehensive assessment of both narrow economic and broader socio-economic performance. This assessment incorporates methods from three pillars areas: Economic - financial returns and efficient use of resources, Social - employment, social and community cohesion and identity, and Environmental - including the physical environment and pollution. These three pillars are then considered in the broader context of governance. In order to structure this evaluation, a novel parameter space model was created, defined by the three pillars and by the scale of the system under assessment. The scale of the system ranged from individual components of an ORE project; to projects comprising of a number of devices; through to a geographic regions in which multiple farms may be deployed. The parameter space consists of an inner circle representing the boundary of interest for a private investor, or a firm, developing an ORE project. The outer circle is characterised by assessment tools typically employed at the broader stakeholder level including economic, social, and environmental methods that can be employed at local, regional or national scale and which are typically employed to inform policy and decision making regarding ORE. Governance sets the stage within which management occurs. Wider impacts to the <b>firm</b> <b>undertaking</b> the project will take into account “externalities” of the project across the three fields. In this model, key methods identified are mapped onto this parameter space and the connectivity explored. The paper demonstrates that the three pillars are inter-connected and each must be considered in any meaningful assessment of ORE sustainability. An integrated assessment approach has the ability to address both the private and the public aspects of an ORE development,. This analysis provides insights on existing best practice, but also reveals the potential for disconnect between an ORE project’s commercial viability and its contribution to environmental and social goals...|$|E

Only one of these equilibria is efficient {{in the sense that the}} worker with the higher innate ability matches with the better firm. A different type of inefficiencies arise when <b>firms</b> <b>undertake</b> their match specific investment before market competition. These inefficiency leads to firms under-investments.
