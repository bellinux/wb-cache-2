40|$|An {{investigation}} was performed regarding {{the application of}} a mechanically stirred anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor containing immobilized biomass on inert polyurethane foam (AnSBBR) to the treatment of soluble metalworking fluids to remove organic matter and produce methane. The effect of increasing organic matter and reactor <b>fill</b> <b>time,</b> as well as shock load, on reactor stability and efficiency have been analyzed. The 5 -L AnSBBR was operated at 30 A degrees C in 8 -h cycles, agitation of 400 rpm, and treated 2. 0 L effluent per cycle. Organic matter was increased by increasing the influent concentration (500, 1, 000, 2, 000, and 3, 000 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD) /L). <b>Fill</b> <b>times</b> investigated were in the batch mode (<b>fill</b> <b>time</b> 10 min) and fed-batch followed by batch (<b>fill</b> <b>time</b> 4 h). In the batch mode, organic matter removal efficiencies were 87 %, 86 %, and 80 % for influent concentrations of 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000 mgCOD/L (1. 50, 3. 12, and 6. 08 gCOD/L. d), respectively. At 3, 000 mgCOD/L (9. 38 gCOD/L. d), operational stability could not be achieved. The reactor managed to maintain stability when a shock load twice as high the feed concentration was applied, evidencing the robustness of the reactor to potential concentration variations in the wastewater being treated. Increasing the <b>fill</b> <b>time</b> to 4 h did not improve removal efficiency, which was 72 % for 2, 000 mgCOD/L. Thus, gradual feeding did not improve organic matter removal. The concentration of methane formed at 6. 08 gCOD/L was 5. 20 mmolCH(4), which corresponded to 78 % of the biogas composition. The behavior of the reactor during batch and fed-batch feeding could be explained by a kinetic model that considers organic matter consumption, production, and consumption of total volatile acids and methane production.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{development}} of a hydrogen storage system using high-pressure metal hydride, Ti 1. 1 CrMn. When absorbing hydrogen (filling), the metal hydride releases large amounts of heat causing the hydride temperature to rise. The reaction rate depends on the metal hydride temperature, decreasing significantly if the heat is not removed quickly. To store 5 kg hydrogen needed to drive 300 miles, about 36 MJ of heat is must be released. For a five minute <b>fill</b> <b>time,</b> this translates to 120 kW of heat generation rate. This is a formidable challenge considering the enormous amount of heat, poor thermal properties of the hydride, and the stringent limits on the heat exchanger’s weight and volume, let alone a host of manufacturing requirements. Additionally, the kinetics of the material is such that the rate of reaction (hydrogen absorption) depends on the ability to quickly dissipate the heat generated. ^ A systematic heat exchanger design methodology is presented here, starting with a 1 -D metal hydride layer distance criterion and progressing through a series of engineering decisions supported by computations of <b>fill</b> <b>time.</b> A modular tube-fin design is arrived at with a goal of achieving a <b>fill</b> <b>time</b> of less than 5 min. The prototype heat exchanger comprising of an intricate network of fins surrounding the metal hydride powder occupies 29 % of the storage vessel volume. Experiments were performed to study the influence of various parameters on the hydriding reaction and a lowest <b>fill</b> <b>time</b> of 4 min 40 s is successfully achieved. Coiled-tube heat exchanger is designed with a primary goal of reducing the volume while still achieving practical <b>fill</b> <b>time.</b> The heat exchanger consists of only a coolant tube strategically coiled around the metal hydride powder. The coiled-tube heat exchanger reduces <b>fill</b> <b>time</b> by 75 % while occupying only 7 % of the storage pressure vessel volume. Dehydriding tests were performed with each design to investigate the influences of hydrogen release rate, fluid flow rate and fluid temperature on the dehydriding process. Dehydriding reaction rate was accelerated by increasing the fluid temperature and/or the rate of pressure drop. ^ Transient two and three dimensional numerical models are constructed that simulate the process of hydriding and dehydriding in Ti 1. 1 CrMn. Spatial distributions of hydride temperature as a function of time over the entire duration of the hydriding reaction are determined, which agree favorably with the experimental data. The models are shown to be quite accurate at predicting the spatial and temporal variations of metal hydride temperature during both the reaction. ^ Effect of pressure vessel size and parameters like hydriding pressure, packing density and effective thermal conductivity, on the size and volume of the storage system is studied. Operating conditions and metal hydride parameters required to meet the Department of Energy (DOE) <b>fill</b> <b>time</b> targets are presented. Various components of a high-pressure metal hydride system are discussed and the storage efficiencies of an optimized storage system using Ti 1. 1 CrMn is presented. ...|$|R

We define a filled interval as the duration between the onset and the offset of a continuous sound, and an empty interval as the duration between two very brief sounds (e. g., Grondin, 2008). Previous studies found clear filled duration illusion for intervals of about 300 ms or longer, but results were not very clear for shorter intervals (e. g., Wearden et al., 2007).
