We salute you {{because you are a}} true and living representation of our hopes and ideals, of the determination we have to be accepted fully as equal beings, of the pride we have held and nurtured in our African origin, of the freedom of which we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> capable, of the freedom in which we believe, of the dignity imperative to our stature as men.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant that}} they had won five {{competitions}} in five months, after winning the FA Cup, Football League Cup and UEFA Cup during the 2000–01 season. They had also won the FA Charity Shield {{at the start of}} the current season. Manager Gérard Houllier congratulated his players on their achievements: [...] "I must congratulate the players for what they achieved in these six months. We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not perfect and we will continue to improve. But the team have shown they possess the winning edge, and this is what we have tried to develop." [...] Man of the match Owen received a £10,000 cheque from match sponsors Carlsberg to be forwarded to a charity of his choice.|$|E
500|$|Oxford saw {{former coach}} and Blue Dan Topolski return as {{director}} of coaching following his departure after the 1992 race. Topolski, who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1967 race, had coached Oxford to ten consecutive victories from 1976 to 1985. He noted: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> underdogs. [...] We started with only one man from a previous Blues race and no internationals. [...] Nothing but big hearts and lungs". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Richard Phelps was upbeat: [...] "We're buoyant, tails up, the boat's been going fast." [...] Cambridge were coached by Robin Williams who was reserved in his assessment, noting his crew needed to be [...] "comfortable with the situation of rowing side-by-side." ...|$|E

500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E
2500|$|False shame: is {{associated}} with false condemnation as in the double bind form of false shaming; [...] "he brought what we did to him upon himself". Author and TV personality John Bradshaw calls shame the [...] "emotion that lets us <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> finite".|$|E
2500|$|... "The younger Negro {{artists who}} create now intend {{to express our}} {{individual}} dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> beautiful. And ugly, too. The tom-tom cries, and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand {{on top of the}} mountain free within ourselves." ...|$|E

Like Informer, all three artists describe a [...] "son" [...] falsely charged with murder. Unlike Informer, Si <b>We</b> Dem Nuh <b>Know</b> <b>We</b> <b>is</b> not a biographical song. Rather, {{the inspiration for}} the song came from murder charges levied against Snow's Uncle Patty. As Snow explained, [...] "It's about an innocent man being charged; anybody who gets falsely accused of a crime." ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2011, King Abdullah {{called on}} {{leaders of the}} Gulf Cooperation Council to {{strengthen}} their alliance into a united [...] "single entity" [...] as they confront threats to national security. [...] "I ask you today to move from a stage of cooperation to a stage of union in a single entity", King Abdullah said at the opening session of a GCC meeting in Riyadh in comments aired on Saudi state television. “No doubt, you all <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> targeted in our security and stability.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Suppose that we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in one {{or other}} of two worlds, and the hypothesis, H, under {{consideration}} {{is that all the}} ravens in our world are black. We know in advance that in one world there are a hundred black ravens, no non-black ravens, and a million other birds; and that in the other world there are a thousand black ravens, one white raven, and a million other birds. A bird is selected equiprobably at random from all the birds in our world. It {{turns out to be a}} black raven. This is strong evidence ... that we are in the second world, wherein not all ravens are black.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E

2500|$|The 37th Division on the {{northern}} (left) flank of VII Corps, held a front [...] from north of Gommecourt to Ransart and was to induce the Germans to expect an attack by simulating preparations. No man's land was too wide for an attack, being [...] deep {{from right to left}} and an advanced trench was dug, similar to the one dug by the 56th (1st London) Division. Periodic smoke and gas discharges were to be made and wire-cutting bombardments fired. [...] Moving the gas cylinders was so difficult that batmen, grooms and other non-combatant troops were pressed into service. For five days before Z Day, trench mortars and machine-guns were to fire {{on either side of the}} Monchy Salient. The bombardments were gradually to increase and the divisional artillery was to bombard German positions, roads and the vicinity of Essarts. Smoke was to be released five minutes before zero hour and infantry were to be held ready to support the 46th (North Midland) Division. VII Corps made no attempt at concealment and in the middle of June the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and its six heavy artillery batteries moved up between the 52nd and 111th divisions. Four days before zero hour, Snow told Haig that [...] "They <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> coming all right".|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{official}} objections to intolerance {{by the party}} leadership and some Reformer MPs, comments and decisions made at party conventions by Reform Party supporters {{on a number of}} issues were considered highly intolerant by onlookers. In 1991, Manning was humiliated at a Reform Party rally when a Reform Party supporter spoke in support of Manning in racist terms, saying “You’re a fine white person. You <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> letting in too many people from the Third World, the low blacks, the low Hispanics. They’re going to take over the province”. Later in the same rally another Reform Party supporter stood up and said “Let them [...] go. We don’t need Quebec.” Long-time Progressive Conservative member and political commentator Dalton Camp observed the 1994 Reform Party convention in Ottawa and was personally disgusted with what he heard, saying: [...] "The speechifying gives off acrid whiffs of xenophobia, homophobia, and paranoia—like an exhaust—in which it seems clear both orator and audience have been seized by some private terror: immigrants, lesbians, people out of work or from out of town and criminals." [...] In the Reform Party policy convention in 1995, Manning urged members to avoid extremism, and a motion was passed by the vote of the delegates that the Reform Party recognized the equality of every individual, but only after the delegates demanded that the words [...] "without discrimination" [...] be removed from the motion. The 1995 convention went on to Reform party delegates controversially called for the removal of group specification in all human rights legisiation which was accepted in the convention by a 93 percent vote in favour. Another controversial motion in the 1995 convention called for tighter regulation of people infected with HIV which was supported by 84 percent of the delegates. One Reformer delegate raised concern that such a policy on HIV would make the party look anti-homosexual, but another delegate responded to this saying [...] "I did not join the Reform Party to bow down at the altar of political correctness".|$|E
