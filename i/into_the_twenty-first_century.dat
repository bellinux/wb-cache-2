25|$|Music {{and singing}} were {{important}} in England during the medieval period, {{being used in}} religious ceremonies, court occasions and to accompany theatrical works. Singing techniques called gymel were introduced in England in the thirteenth century, accompanied by instruments such as the guitar, harp, pipes and organ. Henry IV sponsored an extensive range of music in England, while his son Henry V brought back many influences from occupied France. Carols became an important form of music in the fifteenth century; originally these had been a song sung during a dance with a prominent refrain — the fifteenth century form lost the dancing and introduced strong religious overtones. Ballads were also popular from the late fourteenth century, including the Ballad of Chevy Chase and others describing the activities of Robin Hood. Miracle plays were performed to communicate the Bible in various locations. By the late fourteenth century, these had been extended into vernacular mystery plays which performed annually over several days, broken up into various cycles of plays; a handful have survived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century.</b> Guilds competed to produce the best plays in each town and performances were often an expression of civic identity.|$|E

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the number of cunning folk across Britain had dropped markedly from that of a century before, and by the 1940s they had essentially vanished from the country. Despite this, other professional practitioners of popular magic, such as astrologers and fortune tellers, continued to remain popular. The historian Owen Davies believed that the primary reason for the decline in the cunning craft was the declining belief in the existence of malevolent witchcraft in the country (something brought about by modernization and increasing education and literacy rates), and therefore the collapse of any need for the anti-witchcraft measures that the cunning folk offered as their primary service. Whilst many of their magical practices continued to be used, being performed by folk and ceremonial magicians or being absorbed into new religious movements that used magic such as Wicca, Davies concluded that the actual profession itself died out. Historian Ronald Hutton however believed that it was more accurate to state that the cunning craft, rather than dying out, [...] "changed character" [...] by being absorbed into other magical currents. The decline of the cunning craft in Britain was not however indicative of other European nations: in Italy for example, cunning practitioners continued operating right <b>into</b> <b>the</b> early <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century.</b>|$|R
40|$|The present work is {{an essay}} to answer an enquiry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{significance}} of making translations of classical Chinese works <b>into</b> English in <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century.</b> This question {{grew out of}} an interdisciplinary investigation into Pu Songling’s (1640 - 1715) Liaozhai zhiyi and its English translations, which is aimed at a comprehensive and systematic re-reading of the collection, a diachronic understanding of its English translations, and an in-depth analysis of John Minford’s version published in the Penguin Classics series. All these objects of enquiry are in essence concerned with {{the interpretation of the}} anthology. This thesis is composed of five chapters, beginning with an introduction that sets the scene for the study. It equips the reader with a fundamental grasp of the text and literary context of Liaozhai zhiyi. It gives, too, an overview of the current approaches in academia, in both Chinese and English speaking communities, to Pu Songling’s magnum opus. What follows deals with the nature of Liaozhai zhiyi. Whilst it has been generally taken for granted that it is a collection of morally exemplary fictional short stories, my study points out that Liaozhai zhiyi is in fact a work that thematically defies categorisation. Any attempts to put it in a box are liable to challenges. In response to this problem, a three-tiered conical model has been put forward with a view to approaching the compendium comprehensively and systematically. The third chapter seeks to look for any common features that run through the English versions of Liaozhai zhiyi produced over the past two hundred years or so. From an analysis of the titles selected and the purposes of their stories proclaimed, it is discovered that the translators have revolutionised the nature of the book. Together with the Chinese editors of Chinese editions of selected tales of Liaozhai zhiyi, they have shaped today’s distorted understanding of Pu Songling’s finest work. The fourth chapter is a textual analysis of John Minford’s translation of Liaozhai zhiyi published in the Penguin Classics series in 2006. Whilst his work is highly readable in idiomatic English and contains a great many examples of domestication, there are actually marked traces of foreignization at the same time. Instead of exporting Chinese culture to the West, Minford engaged himself in the production of world literature by breaking the language barrier of Liaozhai zhiyi by virtue of translation. The last chapter is an attempt to explore the significance of making translations of classical Chinese works <b>into</b> English in <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century.</b> It is argued that putting classical works of Chinese into English in our present epoch is not only a mere cultural export of things Chinese, but also an engagement in the current ideological trend of the West by complementing their stress on human’s self-autonomy, an idea which began to emerge {{as a result of the}} Western Enlightenment Movement. published_or_final_versionChineseDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Bush. The party’s founders united against the “slave power,” {{a small group of}} wealthy white men who controlled all three branches of government. These Republicans articulated a new vision of an America in which all hardworking men could rise. But after the Civil War, Republicans began to emulate what they originally opposed. They tied themselves to powerful bankers and industrialists, sacrificing the well-being of ordinary Americans. A similar process took place after World War II, when Republicans sought to dismantle successful New Deal policies and prop up the wealthy. However, in both cases, reformers within the party were able to return the GOP to its founding vision of equality of opportunity, first Theodore Roosevelt during the Progressive Era, and then Dwight D. Eisenhower, who enforced integration and maintained the New Deal. The Nixon and Reagan administrations have represented yet another fall from the GOP’s founding purpose. It's ironic, Richardson points out, that Republicans treated Barack Obama with an unprecedented level of disrespect, as Obama's rise from humble beginnings to the highest office in the nation embodied the vision of the original Republicans.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the previously unstudied treatment of German civilian internees and {{prisoners of war}} taken from the German colonies by British and Dominion authorities during the First World War. Through this study the links between the First World War in the extra-European theatre and the conflict in Europe will be examined. Five key issues are posited for investigation. These are: the centralised internment policy of the British Empire, {{the effect of the}} takeover of German colonies on the cultural identity of the British dominions, the effect wartime captivity had on German settlers, what extra-European internment tells us about twentieth century mobility and warfare, and the integration of the extra-European theatre of <b>the</b> war <b>into</b> <b>the</b> overall Global War narrative. The establishment of a global camp system run from the British imperial metropole involved the coordination of the military, the Admiralty, Dominion governments, and the Colonial and Foreign Offices. The general principles of international law were followed but often overridden through the use of reprisals, and the notion of trying Germans for ‘war crimes’ had an impact far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> twentieth and <b>twenty-first</b> <b>centuries.</b> <b>The</b> First World War and the internment of German civilians and military prisoners in the extra-European theatre undermined the notion of a common European civilising mission in the colonial world. It upset the established colonial racial hierarchies, and through ‘enemy alien' legislation helped establish European hierarchies of race as defined by nationality, disrupting the pre-war world order of cultural globalisation. Through the analysis of German colonial settlers and soldiers in British internment, this thesis demonstrates that the First World War was not just a conflict between the European Great powers but that it also involved a world-wide remaking of ideas, institutions and geopolitics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The qualitative research aimed to investigate the feasibility of using home service {{as a means of}} raising levels of financial literacy and providing support services for the financially excluded. It was recognised in the proposal that home service provision for savings was in decline. However, when the research began, approximately two years after the proposal had been written, very little industrial branch, home service insurance was still in existence. Also, unfortunately, the one large company still operating in the field (which has subsequently closed for new business) refused the researchers access. Therefore the objectives were changed to include an investigation of the demise of industrial branch insurance and its implications. Nevertheless, in-depth research was carried out with three organisations that offered new business to clients. In finding that a sub-prime or near-prime market for credit delivered at the home, either through face-to-face or electronic media, was expanding dramatically, efforts were rebalanced in this area to investigate their implications for financial literacy and social exclusion. The research also aimed to examine changes in financial regulation that might balance the aim of improving financial literacy for marginal groups but meet the demands of providers for some margin of profit {{at the lower end of}} the market. Researchers followed a pilot for a modified ordinary branch sales process testing out the delivery system for new, lower cost products due to come online later in 2004. Main Topics : The data set contains transcript material from interviews with: key informants in home service insurance companies; home collected credit companies; regulatory agencies; focus groups with users of door-to-door delivered financial services companies. The particular focus of this research project was the apparent anachronism of <b>the</b> survival <b>into</b> <b>the</b> early <b>twenty-first</b> <b>century</b> of a relic form of financial services delivery system, that is, door-to-door provision, in an era of largely branch-based and increasingly, telephone and internet-mediated systems. Door-to-door delivery systems for financial services emerged first in the nineteenth century, and signalled the development of mass retail financial markets. Evolving from the earliest Friendly Societies, the pioneers were the industrial branch insurance companies that took advantage of the high density populations in urban areas to sell services to working class households. This sector, which became known as Home Service in the 1960 s, continued to thrive until Financial Services Authority regulations in the 1990 s began to threaten the viability of its door-to-door operations. By late 2003, all Home Service insurance companies had abandoned new industrial branch business and had either outsourced their door-to-door collections of existing business to specialist agencies or converted them to the status of ordinary branch, where payments are generally collected through remote electronic means. The material in this database provides perspectives on door-to-door financial services from both the industry and its customers...|$|R
