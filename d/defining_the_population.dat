30|$|Assessments of {{combined}} exposures {{should begin}} by <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> {{that is the}} subject of the assessment. The population can be defined as groups of humans that are in contact with a specific source in a specific way or can be defined in terms of demographics [23]. The populations of ecological receptors can be based on the trophic levels relevant for a source or sources of exposure. This implies that multiple combined exposure assessments will be required for human health and ecological receptors and multiple assessments maybe required for both human health and ecological effects. Human health assessments may need to address the combined exposures that occur by different routes and over different durations. For example, separate assessments may be required for local acute exposure (e.g., dermal and eye effects) and for chronic systemic effects because the RVs and exposures received by the exposed population will be different for the different endpoints. Separate human health assessments may be required if human exposures cannot be represented by a single population.|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} parasites of domestic, wild, and companion animals, and it also commonly infects humans. Toxoplasma gondii has a complex life cycle. Sexual development occurs only in the cat gut, while asexual replication occurs in many vertebrate hosts. These features combine to create an unusual population structure. The vast majority of strains in North America and Europe fall into three recently derived, clonal lineages known as types I, II and III. Recent studies have revealed that South American strains are more genetically diverse and comprise distinct genotypes. These differences have been shaped by infrequent sexual recombination, population sweeps and biogeography. The majority of human infections that have been studied in North America and Europe are caused by type II strains, which are also common in agricultural animals from these regions. In contrast, several diverse genotypes of T. gondii are associated with severe infections in humans in South America. <b>Defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> structure of T. gondii from new regions has important implications for transmission, immunogenicity and pathogenesis...|$|E

This study aimed to characterize whether the concomitant use of a statin with clarithromycin is associated with serious outcomes among adult persons. Methods: Health claims data of adult persons in the Regional Sickness Fund of Burgenland, Austria, who filled a prescription for clarithromycin between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. We assumed that the risk of hospitalisation increases acutely with the indication for taking an antibiotic, whereas statin use can be considered a chronic exposure with a low constant effect on hospitalisation. When <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> as persons taking clarithromycin and the use of statins as the exposure we could achieve a comparable effect in both groups from the acute condition on hospitalisation. Therefore, we defined exposed patients as those who had overlapping treatmen...|$|E

A major {{challenge}} for environmental epidemiology lies in correctly identifying populations at risk from exposure to environmental pollutants. The complexity of today’s environment makes it essential that the methods chosen are accurate and sensitive. Methods: Environmental and mathematical methods were used to identify the population potentially exposed to a point source of airborne pollution emanating from a waste incinerator. Soil sampling was undertaken at 83 sites throughout the city and environs. The concentrations of arsenic and copper were measured at each site. Computer software produced smoothed contour plots {{of the distribution of}} arsenic and copper in the soil based on the information derived from the sampling sites. The popula-tion at risk was also identified using concentric rings of varying radii, with the source of pollution at the centre. Lastly, we used the sites that had previously been selected and measured the frequency of wind direction, speed and distance from the source of pollution at each site. Theoretical contour plots were constructed using the distance from the source of pollution at each site, with and without incorporating wind frequency as a function of direction. Results: Each method identified different populations at risk from airborne pollution. The use of circle...|$|E
40|$|The {{notoriously}} multi-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus is {{an emerging}} pathogen causing serious infections in immunocompromised patients. <b>Defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> structure {{is important to}} detect outbreaks and spread of antimicrobial resistant clones. Currently, the standard typing technique is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In this study we describe novel molecular typing schemes for S. haemolyticus using multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and multi locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis. Seven housekeeping genes (MLST) and five VNTR loci (MLVF) were selected for the novel typing schemes. A panel of 45 human and veterinary S. haemolyticus isolates was investigated. The collection had diverse PFGE patterns (38 PFGE types) and was sampled over a 20 year-period from eight countries. MLST resolved 17 sequence types (Simpsons index of diversity [SID] = 0. 877) and MLVF resolved 14 repeat types (SID = 0. 831). We found a low sequence diversity. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the isolates in three (MLST) and one (MLVF) clonal complexes, respectively. Taken together, neither the MLST nor the MLVF scheme was suitable to resolve the population structure of this S. haemolyticus collection. Future MLVF and MLST schemes will benefit from addition of more variable core genome sequences identified by comparing different fully sequenced S. haemolyticus genomes...|$|E
