5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April German {{newspaper}} Bild {{announced that}} contestant Max Buskohl quit the competition due to RTL's rejection of his request {{to let his}} school band Empty Trash get a recording contract alongside him. Viewers <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> about judge Dieter Bohlen's uncharacteristic behaviour when he gave an extremely critical review of Buskohl's performance on 21 April. Buskohl {{is alleged to have}} said that Bohlen was asocial, which explains Bohlen's negative reaction. Contestant Martin Stosch, who was eliminated on 21 April, remained as a contestant despite being voted off the week prior, replacing Buskohl. However, Buskohl's father Carl Carlton told Spiegel Online that his son already made his decision to leave on 19 April but waited until Sunday to make his announcement at request of RTL.|$|E
25|$|Rectangles {{have been}} the most popular and common {{geometric}} form for buildings since the shape is easy to stack and organize; as a standard, it is easy to design furniture and fixtures to fit inside rectangularly shaped buildings. But triangles, while more difficult to use conceptually, provide a great deal of strength. As computer technology helps architects design creative new buildings, triangular shapes are becoming increasingly prevalent as parts of buildings and as the primary shape for some types of skyscrapers as well as building materials. In Tokyo in 1989, architects <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> whether it was possible to build a 500-story tower to provide affordable office space for this densely packed city, but with the danger to buildings from earthquakes, architects considered that a triangular shape would have been necessary if such a building was ever to have been built (it hasn't by 2011).|$|E

500|$|Latter Days {{was written}} and {{directed}} by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, Sweet Home Alabama, gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story. Cox based both characters– Christian and Aaron– on himself. He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay, and <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> what the two halves of himself would have said to each other if they had ever met.|$|E
500|$|Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has {{inspired}} dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and Mad TV. Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled [...] "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood {{why so many people}} would walk up to him on the street and blurt, [...] "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he <b>had</b> <b>wondered,</b> [...] "what's wrong with these people?" [...] The Walking Dead has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.|$|E
500|$|The Democratic {{press was}} unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and {{attacked}} {{him for not}} publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him [...] "General Mum". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, [...] "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." [...] John de Ziska, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> how to [...] "get rid of" [...] Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: [...] "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it, he will sit {{the remainder of his}} days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy." [...] This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers.|$|E

2500|$|In the 17th century, the English nonconformist/Anglican {{priest and}} {{botanist}} John Ray, {{in his book}} The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692), <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> [...] "why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on".|$|E
2500|$|Takeuchi {{struggled}} {{with a name}} for Black Lady, initially calling her [...] "the Black Queen" [...] and retaining her childlike appearance.

Pestilences, prodigies, portents, the results of seeming accidents, excite the vulgar mind. Only the abnormal or casual is worthy of their attention. The man of science finds a deeper and more awful charm in contemplating the results of law; in watching, not what seem to be occasional failures in nature: but what is a perpetual and calm success.|$|R

2500|$|Screenwriter Alex Garland was {{inspired}} to write Sunshine based on scientific ideas about the heat death of the universe, specifically [...] "an article projecting the future of mankind from a physics-based, atheist perspective", according to Garland. The article was from an American scientific periodical, and Garland <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> about what would result from the Sun's death. Garland said of the project: [...] "What interested me {{was the idea that}} it could get to a point when the entire planet's survival rests on the shoulders of one man, and what that would do to his head." ...|$|E

He said he lost [...] from his previously overweight body, {{as a result of}} the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time traveling around the country, with time scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: [...] "I wondered again, as I <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> when I first went to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor.

The song [...] "Dynamite" [...] was originally performed by American singer Brenda Lee in 1957. Much like the songs on Sheena's cover album , it was a song that Sheena's parents owned at their home. Her father <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> why she had not recorded it for Utaite Myōri: Sono Ichi. The liner notes for [...] "Kokoro" [...] list a date, November 25, 2003. This is the date of Sheena's 25th birthday, and was the release date for her solo single [...] "Ringo no Uta". The song's concept was record a song in a single day as a present for others on her birthday. The song was given the figurative translation [...] "Spiritual" [...] in English.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> if Tiner's liberal {{newspaper}} editorials had cost him potential {{votes in the}} congressional race. Tiner {{said that he had}} not expected his editorials to become a campaign issue. When the editorials became part of the campaign, Tiner called himself [...] "a conservative with a heart", a designation like what George W. Bush would late dub as [...] "compassionate conservatism". When Tiner was questioned about a change in his position to support navigation of the Red River and American aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, he said that the previous opposition to both proposals came from the Shreveport Journal editorial board, not himself: [...] "The Shreveport Journal is not running for Congress. ... I'm coming out from behind the printing press ... two years from now the {{people will be able to}} see what I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ahern {{has said}} that he lives by the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes and his own conscience, and hopes to get to heaven when he dies. Speaking to Gay Byrne in RTÉ's The Meaning of Life series, Mr Ahern {{described}} himself as a regular Mass-goer, but said he had not been to Confession for 40 years. In a lengthy interview, Mr Ahern revealed that he and the former DUP leader Dr Ian Paisley bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004 at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Dr Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was [...] "like our Confiteor" [...] and officials <b>had</b> <b>wondered</b> why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing their values and the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at €128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out €1 billion. As a Catholic, he wanted the church to [...] "do well", but it could not retreat behind canon law, he said. [...] "There was one time when the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked up to the sky and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren’t joking, they made bad decisions." [...] Mr Ahern said he was convinced that life [...] "did not end at the graveyard" [...] and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God cannot influence [...] "every single thing". He said he received a [...] "fair amount of hate mail" [...] about [...] "living in sin", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents’ [...] "stereotype" [...] of married life.|$|E
