25|$|In late 2007, Dreamer {{took part}} in the ECW brand's {{elimination}} chase to name a number one contender to the ECW Championship. During the series of matches, also involving Stevie Richards, Elijah Burke, and Kevin Thorn he added a bandana, worn on his head, to his ring gear. He received the original one from a young boy with a brain tumor, and from then on began wearing one as a sign of solidarity and strength to anyone <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> struggle. Dreamer emerged victorious in the final match against Burke, only to be surprised by ECW's general manager Armando Estrada forcing him to face Big Daddy V, who promptly beat him for the number one contendership.|$|E

It wasn't even with, like, guy relationships, it was just, like, friends and just letting people in, you know?

500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a good rule of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E

2500|$|The optimum illumination, {{taking into}} account both {{exposure}} dose and focus windows, is a strong function of pitch in the range between 32 nm and 48 nm, which is {{where most of the}} work on EUV application has been focused. For pitches larger than 44 nm, the illumination pupil shape is preferably conventional, which is a circular disc, possibly including a central obscuration to provide an annular appearance. For pitches in the range 44 nm down to 34 nm, the optimum shape is no longer conventional or annular but more shaped like the [...] "quasar" [...] (Quadrupole-shaped annular) source, i.e., an arc within each quadrant of the pupil. For pitches of 32 nm and below, the optimum illumination becomes more dipole like, i.e., concentrated toward the top and bottom or the left and right ends of the pupil. When source-mask optimization is performed, the resulting shape will resemble the closest of the standard set (conventional, annular, quasar, dipole). For pitches less than 41 nm, the central portion of the pupil must be excluded for a tool with NA=0.33, as 13.5 nm EUV light <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> portion would only contribute the zeroth diffraction order (unscattered light), effectively adding flare.|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{noticed that}} the new album sounds {{different}} from Zola Jesus' earlier works. [...] "I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write. And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements. [...] I just wanted more breathing room, so people could insert their own experiences into the song, their own feelings into the song, as opposed to me forcing it on them with the densest sound possible", Danilova explained. Speaking to Prefix Magazine after her performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, {{she said she wanted}} the album to be a step forward. [...] "n doing that, there was so, so much trial and error and so much quitting music {{at the end of the}} day", she admitted. Danilova said that the title of the album (meaning [...] "moving forward" [...] in Latin) appeared before the work on it began. [...] "I had it in mind beforehand because I knew that's what I was going through even before I sat down to work on the record, I was already <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> emotional process of trying to push myself", she said.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrianne León was {{announced}} {{to become a}} recast {{for the role of}} Colleen. Leon wanted to portray Colleen as more grown up and a little different from Fonseca's take on the role, saying she would be [...] "coming back with a whole new determination to get what she wants" [...] and that [...] "she didn't have any expectations set in stone, but it's always hard to see your first love with someone else". When Colleen returned, she acted as an obstacle in J.T.'s romance with Mackenzie Browning (then Rachel Kimsey). When Kimsey was let go and Mackenzie exited, J.T. and Colleen reunited, and another obstacle designed to break them up {{came in the form of}} a new character, Adrian Korbel (Eyal Podell). León theorized that while Colleen felt an attraction to Korbel, her heart belonged to J.T., saying: [...] "She absolutely loves him and adores him, but she's <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> change where she was a little girl and now she's not. She's growing up and evolving. The bad boy was interesting to her when she was a teenager, but now she's more interested in the intellectual." [...] Leon portrayed the character as confused while she conflicted between her love for J.T. and her attraction to Korbel. Colleen later cheated on J.T. with him, and they separated for the final time.|$|E

2500|$|The band partly {{returned}} to the creative process used {{in the creation of}} The Warning in that some parts of songs were written and recorded in Goddard's bedroom, with Taylor also writing from his house and recording in the room he designated as a [...] "music room". These parts were then built upon in a studio where the band had more space, enabling them to [...] "expand on things". Goddard used Cubase to record at his house whilst Logic Pro was used in the studio as well as GarageBand to create parts of songs. Of the latter Taylor said, [...] "that's what I use for recording, and that's like half of the record is <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> program". In regards {{to the creation of the}} music, Taylor stated that everyone had involvement in aspects of all of the tracks. Taylor stated that the group felt as though they had exhausted their home studio sound and the possibilities of the instruments they could use at home. Despite this, Taylor explained that he and Joe have a similar work aesthetic and that ideas would [...] "come [...] any time of the day or night"; working on material at home would enable them to [...] "record at home whenever ideas come". However Taylor stated, [...] "even the studio we worked in, it's not like a professional studio that is like, top of the range. It's just a big basement with a desk and various synthesisers and a drum kit." ...|$|E
