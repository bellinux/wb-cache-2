The molad can be calculated by multiplying the number of months that will have elapsed since some (preceding) molad whose weekday is known by the mean length of a (synodic) lunar month, which is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts (there are 1080 [...] "parts" [...] in an hour, so that one part is equal to 3 seconds). The very first molad, the molad tohu, fell on Sunday evening at 11.11, or in Jewish terms Day 2, 5 hours, and 204 parts.|$|E

60|$|From {{what has}} been said in the {{foregoing}} chapters, {{it is easy to}} perceive what imperfection there is in language, and how the very nature of words makes it almost unavoidable for many of them to be doubtful and uncertain in their significations. To examine the perfection or imperfection of words, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to consider their use and end: for as they are more or less fitted to attain that, so they are more or less perfect.

60|$|In Lecture I we {{criticized the}} {{analysis}} of a presentation into act, content and object. But our analysis of belief contains three very similar elements, namely the believing, what is believed and the objective. The objections to the act ({{in the case of}} presentations) are not valid against the believing in the case of beliefs, because the believing is an actual experienced feeling, not something postulated, like the act. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to complete our preliminary requisites, and then to examine the content of a belief.

60|$|But {{in spite}} of the obvious merit of such {{institutions}} as exist, misgivings would arise.

Nominally, the mother still comes to see her child in these schools, but in actual fact, the drafting of children to the country must intervene, and the whole temper of the authorities seemed to be directed towards breaking the link between mother and child. To some this will seem an advantage, and it is a point which admits of lengthy discussion, but as it belongs rather to the question of women and the family under Communism, I can do no more than mention it here.|$|E

60|$|To explain {{properly}} {{the nature}} of this dream, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to state that Cyrus had two sons. Their names were Cambyses and Smerdis. He had left them in Persia when he set out on his expedition across the Araxes. There was also a young man, then about twenty years of age, in one of his capitals, named Darius. He was the son of one of the nobles of Cyrus's court. His father's name was Hystaspes. Hystaspes, besides being a noble of the court, was also, as almost all nobles were in those days, an officer of the army. He accompanied Cyrus in his march into the territories of the barbarian queen, and was with him there, in camp, at the time when this narrative commences.|$|E
6000|$|The mode of {{government}} now adopted in Java is {{to retain the}} whole series of native rulers, from the village chief up to princes, who, {{under the name of}} Regents, are the heads of districts {{about the size of a}} small English county. With each Regent is placed a Dutch Resident, or Assistant Resident, who is considered to be his [...] "elder brother," [...] and whose [...] "orders" [...] take the form of [...] "recommendations," [...] which are, however, implicitly obeyed. Along with each Assistant Resident is a Controller, a kind of inspector of all the lower native rulers, who periodically visits every village in the district, examines the proceedings of the native courts, hears complaints against the head-men or other native chiefs, and superintends the Government plantations. This brings us to the [...] "culture system," [...] which is the source of all the wealth the Dutch derive from Java, and is the subject of much abuse in this country because it is the reverse of [...] "free trade." [...] To understand its uses and beneficial effects, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to sketch the common results of free European trade with uncivilized peoples.|$|E
60|$|The {{predominant}} {{interest of}} evolutionism {{is in the}} question of human destiny, or at least of the destiny of Life. It {{is more interested in}} morality and happiness than in knowledge for its own sake. It must be admitted that the same may be said of many other philosophies, and that a desire for the kind of knowledge which philosophy can give is very rare. But if philosophy is to attain truth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> and foremost that philosophers should acquire the disinterested intellectual curiosity which characterises the genuine man of science. Knowledge concerning the future--which is the kind of knowledge that must be sought if we are to know about human destiny--is possible within certain narrow limits. It is impossible to say how much the limits may be enlarged with the progress of science. But what is evident is that any proposition about the future belongs by its subject-matter to some particular science, and is to be ascertained, if at all, by the methods of that science. Philosophy is not a short cut to the same kind of results as those of the other sciences: {{if it is to be}} a genuine study, it must have a province of its own, and aim at results which the other sciences can neither prove nor disprove.|$|E

50|$|The FR's {{plan was}} to start the project at Caernarfon, {{rather than at the}} {{original}} WHR northern terminus at Dinas, because of the link to a town with a major tourist attraction already - the famous Castle.

6000|$|... § XII. You think, perhaps, I {{have put}} the {{requirements}} in wrong order. Logically I have; practically I have not: for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to teach men to speak out, and say what they like, truly; and, in the second place, to teach them which of their likings are ill set, and which justly. If a man is cold in his likings and dislikings, or if he will not {{tell you what he}} likes, you can make nothing of him. Only get him to feel quickly and to speak plainly, and you may set him right. And the fact is, that the great evil of all recent architectural effort has not been that men liked wrong things: but that they either cared nothing about any, or pretended to like what they did not. Do you suppose that any modern architect likes what he builds, or enjoys it? Not in the least. He builds it because he has been told that such and such things are fine, and that he should like them. He pretends to like them, and gives them a false relish of vanity. Do you seriously imagine, reader, that any living soul in London likes triglyphs?[30]--or gets any hearty enjoyment out of pediments?[31] You are much mistaken. Greeks did: English people never did,--never will. Do you fancy that the architect of old Burlington Mews, in Regent Street, had any particular satisfaction in putting the blank triangle over the archway, instead of a useful garret window? By no manner of means. He had been told it was right to do so, and thought he should be admired for doing it. Very few faults of architecture are mistakes of honest choice: they are almost always hypocrisies.|$|E
60|$|But {{though these}} nominal {{essences}} of substances {{are made by}} the mind, they are not yet made so arbitrarily as those of mixed modes. To the making of any nominal essence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> <b>First,</b> that the ideas whereof it consists have such a union as to make but one idea, how compounded soever. Secondly, that the particular ideas so united be exactly the same, neither more nor less. For if two abstract complex ideas differ either in number or sorts of their component parts, they make two different, and not {{one and the same}} essence. In the first of these, the mind, in making its complex ideas of substances, only follows nature; and puts none together which are not supposed to have a union in nature. Nobody joins the voice of a sheep with the shape of a horse; nor the colour of lead with the weight and fixedness of gold, to be the complex ideas of any real substances; unless he has a mind to fill his head with chimeras, and his discourse with unintelligible words. Men observing certain qualities always joined and existing together, therein copied nature; and of ideas so united made their complex ones of substances. For, though men may make what complex ideas they please, and give what names to them they will; yet, if they will be understood WHEN THEY SPEAK OF THINGS REALLY EXISTING, they must in some degree conform their ideas to the things they would speak of; or else men's language will be like that of Babel; and every man's words, being intelligible only to himself, would no longer serve to conversation and the ordinary affairs of life, if the ideas they stand for be not some way answering the common appearances and agreement of substances as they really exist.|$|E
60|$|We {{reached at}} night a {{beautiful}} little cove, {{north of the}} island of Caucahue. The people here complained of want of land. This is partly owing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods, and partly to restrictions by the government, which makes it necessary, before buying ever so small a piece, to pay two shillings to the surveyor for measuring each quadra (150 yards square), together with whatever price he fixes {{for the value of}} the land. After his valuation the land must be put up three times to auction, and if no one bids more, the purchaser can have it at that rate. All these exactions must be a serious check to clearing the ground, where the inhabitants are so extremely poor. In most countries, forests are removed without much difficulty by the aid of fire; but in Chiloe, from the damp nature of the climate, and the sort of trees, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>first</b> to cut them down. This is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of Chiloe. In the time of the Spaniards the Indians could not hold land; and a family, after having cleared a piece of ground, might be driven away, and the property seized by the government. The Chilian authorities are now performing an act of justice by making retribution to these poor Indians, giving to each man, according to his grade of life, a certain portion of land. The value of uncleared ground is very little. The government gave Mr. Douglas (the present surveyor, who informed me of these circumstances) eight and a half square miles of forest near S. Carlos, in lieu of a debt; and this he sold for 350 dollars, or about 70 pounds sterling.|$|E
