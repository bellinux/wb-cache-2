30|$|Chemically, {{the size}} of GNPs can be {{controlled}} by {{the ratio of the}} reducing/stabilizing agents to the gold (III) derivatives. In this study, 15 -nm GNPs were produced by adding 0.5 % (wt%) of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> which acted as a reducing agent at the beginning and a stabilizer subsequently. Larger GNPs can be engineered by using a reduced amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Stoichiometrically, 0.05 % (wt%) of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> is required to reduce all the gold (III) derivatives in this sample. Incomplete reaction occurs if the <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> concentration is smaller than 0.05 % (wt%), and vice versa. For concentrations less than 0.5 %, the amount of extra citrate ions will not be sufficient to stabilize all the GNPs, which would result in an aggregation phenomenon producing large nanoparticles. As a consequence, a general trend of GNP size reduction with the increase of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> is observed in the experiments, which is consistent with other studies. By properly controlling the ratio of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> to gold (III) derivatives, the GNP size can be engineered in the range of 10 - 150 nm.|$|R

40|$|Background: Calcium {{plays an}} {{integral}} role in olfactory signal transduction, including feedback inhibition. <b>Sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{acts as a}} calcium sequestrant and when applied intranasally, reduces free calcium available for feedback inhibition, which should theoretically improve olfaction. We aimed to investigate the utility of intranasal <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> in improving the olfactory function of hyposmic patients, by performing this prospective placebo controlled, single-blinded trial. Methodology: Monorhinal olfactory testing for odour identification and threshold was performed in hyposmic patients using “Sniffin’ Sticks”, before and after treatment. Treatment consisted of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> solution application to the olfactory cleft.

It is known that an arteriovenous fi sutla provides the best vascular access, but its creation is not always possible. Other solutions, such as the insertion of a central venous catheter, are then required. Adequate protection of such catheters by interdialytic fi ll with locking solution affects the frequency of hemodialysis-related complications. The most widespread catheter locking solution is heparin. <b>Sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> is being used more frequent recently. Available data indicate that hemorrhage is 11. 9 times more frequent if the catheter locking solution is 5000 IU/ml heparin than if 4 � 0 <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> or 1000 IU/ml heparin is used.

Sample Population-Blood samples obtained from 4 Thoroughbreds. Procedure-Blood was collected into syringes in the ratio of 9 parts biood: 1 part anticoagulant. Anticoagulants used were <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate,</b> LMWH, <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> and LMWH, or 300 nM PGE(1) /ml of anticoagulant. Platelet aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and PGE 1 was assessed, using optical aggregometry. Platelet activation was evaluated, using flow cytometry, to detect binding of fluorescein-conjugated anti-human fibrinogen antibody. Plasma concentration of ionized calcium was measured, using an ion-selective electrode. Results-Number of platelets (mean +/- SEM) in samples containing LMWH (109. 5 +/- 11. 3 x 10 (3) cells/mul) was significantly less than the number in samples containing <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> (187. 3 +/- 30. 3 x 10 (3) cells/mul). increasing concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> resulted in reductions in platelet aggregation and plasma concentration of ionized calcium.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> on the {{formation}} of a cement stone in the aluminous binder. Formation of cement stone framework in cement hydraulic binder is accompanied with complicated physical and chemical processes of interphase interactions and dispersion, these processes are predicated on qualitative and quantitative composition of the cement mortar, continuous changes in its properties from preparation stage till curing. Addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> to tempering water enhances hydration of both Portland cement and calcium aluminate cement. Process pertaining to an increase of cement hydration rate is considered as a consequence of destruction in surface formations and exclusion of damping effect in respect of hydration rate and hydrolysis of products resulted from interaction of clinker material with tempering. It has been established that <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> makes it possible to control processes of hydration, hydrolysis, binding and curing for cement mass. High degree of hydration of aluminous cement in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> provides fast binding and curing of binder, low porosity and rather high compression breaking strength of cement stone for all curing stages. An increase in concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> in cement mixture up to 10 % of the cement mass exerts an influence not only on the process of cement mortar liquefaction, reduction of time for cement mass setting and hardening but also increases compression strength of cement stone.
