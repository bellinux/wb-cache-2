40|$|Recent {{research}} {{conducted in the}} UK for the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) suggested {{that there was no}} evidence to indicate that the involvement of service users and lay assessors <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>inspections</b> improved the quality of inspections.

However, the appropriateness of this usage has not been without some challenge and various conceptual difficulties have been raised in how the term is used. Reflecting on reports published by CSCI, this paper considers whether the choice of the word ‘expert’ in this context is really appropriate and also whether, although well intentioned, the involvement of ‘experts by experience’ is too confused in its rationale to actually empower the people using the services being inspected. The paper concludes by suggesting that the current inspection body—the Care Quality Commission—would do well to review both the terminological and conceptual confusion in respect of this practice...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the {{regulatory}} “risk informed ” approach for nuclear power plants started to develop in the USA. Shortly after that, this approach was emerging in several European countries. The idea in a risk informed <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>inspection</b> (RI-ISI) process is to evaluate the failure potential or rate in passive systems, structures and components. In a quantitative RI-ISI process the failure probability or rate at each location is usually calculated with so called Structural Reliability Models (SRMs). This paper shows the results of a benchmark study with five different SRMs conducted in the frame of the European project NURBIM (Nuclear Risk Based Inspection Methodology for Passive Components). The SRM codes are demonstrated to work {{in a wide range of}} parameter variations and differences in the calculated failure probabilities can in most cases be explained from the theoretical basis of the SRMs. A set of requirements to be fulfilled by a SRM and the associated software for application in a risk informed <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>inspection</b> study are then formulated. ...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{materials}} {{for use in}} the aerospace industry are presently being developed and applied at an astonishing rate. This pace is driven by the need for materials that can withstand higher operating temperatures and loads, yet remain cost competitive.

This demand for improved performance characteristics is also generating strong interest in other materials such as: exotic alloys, ceramics and reinforced composites. A need exists for characterizing these advanced {{materials for}} composition variations, flaw content, inclusions and porosity using nondestructive techniques at all stages of the materials life cycle.

Two calibration tests (with strain gauges and image correlation) were used to obtain the relationship between the imposed deflection and the radial strain on the FABIME 2 specimen. A numerical study has confirmed this relationship. Biaxial fatigue tests are carried out on two austenitic stainless steels for different values of the maximum deflection, and with a load ratio equal to - 1. The interpretation of the experimental results requires the use of an appropriate definition of strain equivalent. In nuclear industry, two kinds of definition are used: von Mises and TRESCA strain equivalent.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{manufactured}} metal building warehouses {{loaded with}} agricultural products failed <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> <b>Inspection</b> revealed con siderable {{damage to the}} structure and the foundation. The building owner filed suit against the building supplier, the building erector, and the soils testing laboratory whose engineer had designed the foundation. The agricultural product imposed substantial outward lateral pressures {{on the walls of}} the structures. Review of the available design documents indicated that these loads had not been accounted for in design. A structural analysis revealed that elements of the structure were underdesigned for the agricultural product loads. In addition, the foundation did not have any slab reinforcement to resist the loads. To prevent similar failures, these loads must be accounted for in design. The steel structure design and foundation design were both deficient. A contributing factor was the lack of communication between the designer of the structure and the designer of the foundation, due to the lack of a single engineer of record to take responsibility for the buildings...|$|E

The introduction of European and ASME standards has brought some coherence to the application of TOFD for fabrication inspection. However, a difficulty lies in the determination of actual coverage by TOFD on different geometries. Although for instance ASME specifically requires documented evidence of the coverage achieved, common practice is that at best a table is included in the procedure indicating the setups for the different weld geometries involved. To produce a documented examination strategy showing component coverage is cumbersome without software aids.

They are compared to in water experimental measurements. Cases with one, two and three parallel plates without then with an artificial defect are presented for identical and different thicknesses of plates.
