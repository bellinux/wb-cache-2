5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} found greater {{diversity}} in the genetic markers of dogs from East and Central Asia compared to Europe and have concluded that dogs originated from these regions, despite no archaeological {{evidence to support the}} conclusions. One reason for these discrepancies is the sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000 years, which has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the modern wolf populations are related to the Pleistocene wolves that were first domesticated. In other words, the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758, but his type locality is unknown. The scientific {{name comes from}} the Latin with Millepora meaning [...] "thousand-pored" [...] and alcicornis meaning [...] "elk-horned". It {{seems likely that the}} type locality is in fact the West Indies. Explaining this in 1941 Crossland wrote [...] "I cannot resist the remark that the one thing quite certain about the many forms of Millepora <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of them have any resemblance to an elk's horn, except perhaps that from the West Indies".|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} entitled We Are Mongrels, but the title {{had to be}} changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy show, We Are Klang. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the characters were mongrels. Therefore, new suggestions were called for. Rejected titles included I, Nelson; Humans! Everywhere!; Undergrowth and Never Been Stroked. The last of these titles was rejected {{after one of the}} show's additional writers, Danielle Ward; [...] "said it sounded like 'a makeover show for virgins'." [...] During this time the crew referred to the show as Mongrels and it eventually became the show's title.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of the Isabella quarter {{depicts a}} crowned and richly clothed bust of that Spanish queen. [...] According to art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, Barber's obverse design [...] "follow Gilbert Scott's Victorian Gothic tradition of photographic classicism, best {{summed up by}} the groups of continents and the reliefs of famous persons on the Albert Memorial in London." [...] The reverse depicts a kneeling woman with distaff and spindle. [...] Vermeule traces that imagery to {{the figure of a}} young female servant, carved upon the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia in the 5th century B.C. [...] Nevertheless, a contemporary account in the American Journal of Numismatics compared the reverse to an anti-slavery token with a kneeling woman and the legend [...] "Am I not a woman and a sister". [...] The art historian, writing in 1971, noted that [...] "nowadays the coin seems charming for its quaintness and its Victorian flavor, a mixture of cold Hellenism and Renaissance romance. [...] Perhaps one of its greatest joys <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the customary inscriptions, mottoes and such, appear on it." ...|$|E

500|$|In the June 2006 {{edition of}} Harper's Magazine Spiegelman had an article {{published}} on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy; some interpretations of Islamic law prohibit the depiction of Muhammad. [...] The Canadian chain of booksellers Indigo refused to sell the issue. [...] Called [...] "Drawing Blood: Outrageous Cartoons and the Art of Outrage", the article surveyed the sometimes dire effect political cartooning has for its creators, ranging from Honoré Daumier, who spent time in prison for his satirical work; to George Grosz, who faced exile. [...] To Indigo the article seemed to promote the continuance of racial caricature. [...] An internal memo [...] advised Indigo staff to tell people: [...] "the decision was made {{based on the fact}} that the content about to be published has been known to ignite demonstrations around the world." [...] In response to the cartoons, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for submissions of antisemitic cartoons. [...] Spiegelman produced a cartoon of a line of prisoners being led to the gas chambers; one stops to look at the corpses around him and says, [...] "Ha! Ha! Ha! What’s really hilarious <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of this is actually happening!" ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{a growing}} {{consensus}} in the United States that U.S. aid to contain communism in Indochina was necessary, State Department diplomat Charlton Ogburn sounded a cautionary note. [...] "The trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of us knows enough about Indochina and [...] "we have had no real political reporting from there since [...] Reed and [...] O'Sullivan left two years ago." [...] Ogburn said the Viet Minh had fought the French to a draw and were unlikely [...] "to wilt under the psychological impact of American military assistance." [...] Even if defeated, the Viet Minh could return to guerrilla tactics and bide their time." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{urged that}} {{presently}} polarized national debate be conducted [...] "in {{a way that}} heals, not {{in a way that}} wounds." [...] Quoting the Book of Job 30:26, he observed that [...] "terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding." [...] He then said, [...] "For the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack", and that no one can know [...] "what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man's mind". Urging his listeners to avoid using the tragedy as [...] "one more occasion to turn on one another", he recommended humility, empathy and especially reflection instead, urging people to consider whether they have [...] "shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives".|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the exoteric {{works is}} extant – {{that all of}} Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them {{may have been in}} dialogue form. (Fragments of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as [...] "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us. However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.|$|E
2500|$|Among other Beatles biographers, [...] "Pure Smokey" [...] {{is viewed}} as {{superior}} to Harrison's previous Robinson tribute. Simon Leng considers [...] "Pure Smokey" [...] to be both [...] "the most successful, and succinct, summation of his attachments to the [...] genre" [...] and [...] "one of its author's most appealing songs". Leng praises Harrison's guitar solos for their understated, melodic approach – in which he detects [...] "a nod to Eric Clapton, but with added Carl Perkins twang" [...] – and concludes: [...] "A fact often overlooked <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the other Beatles came close to offering convincing soul moods, whereas they were a fundamental part of the Dark Horse's musical vocabulary." [...] Ian Inglis summarises [...] "Pure Smokey" [...] as [...] "a wonderful example of Harrison's obvious affection for sweet soul, both as a singer and a songwriter", and includes it among lesser-known Harrison compositions such as [...] "Your Love Is Forever", [...] "Life Itself" [...] and [...] "That's the Way It Goes", {{all of which are}} [...] "often overlooked" [...] yet possess [...] "great charm, energy, and beauty".|$|E

30|$|There {{were certain}} {{limitations}} in our analysis. First, the major {{limitation of this}} meta-analysis <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> of the included studies were randomized.

Second, included studies were from only 2 countries, Korea and China, so the results need further confirmation in other countries.|$|R
2500|$|However, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton {{noted that}} if the same contestants in the PDG meet {{repeatedly}} (in the so-called Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Trivers' 1971 reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism. In [...] "tit-for-tat" [...] both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, {{which can only be}} rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, [...] "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like [...] "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was [...] "betray".), but all can be outperformed by {{at least one of the}} other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>none</b> is evolutionarily stable, and any prolonged series of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, in which alternative strategies arise at random, gives rise to a chaotic sequence of strategy changes that never ends.|$|E
