5|$|The <b>Imperial</b> Counselor {{transmitted}} {{and received}} <b>imperial</b> edicts {{to and from}} the chancellery and also presented officials' memorials to the throne. During Western Han, the Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk's office was located within the walls of the palace. He had the authority to investigate attendants and eunuchs of the palace and to reject improperly written memorials before submission to the <b>Imperial</b> Counselor. The Masters of Writing under the Minister Steward then processed these memorials before they were sent to the throne. The Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk's proximity to the emperor during Eastern Han allowed him to surpass the authority of his nominal superior, the Excellency of Works, yet his Western-Han-era power to inspect local provincial authorities was removed. The Minister Steward—who was supervised by the <b>Imperial</b> Counselor (and later Excellency of Works)—became the Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk's new superior by early Eastern Han. The Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk also managed the <b>Imperial</b> Library in both Western and Eastern Han, this duty being transferred to a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies in 159 AD.|$|E

5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the <b>Imperial</b> Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the <b>Imperial</b> Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} <b>imperial</b> family. He oversaw the <b>imperial</b> court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended <b>imperial</b> family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the <b>imperial</b> family, the Minister of the <b>Imperial</b> Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of <b>imperial</b> family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, <b>imperial</b> princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the <b>Imperial</b> Clan.|$|E
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the <b>Imperial</b> Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most <b>Imperial</b> Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the <b>Imperial</b> fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on <b>Imperial</b> ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Navy's {{attacks on}} the Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from Japanese attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean.

5|$|Both the Inspector and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the <b>imperial</b> court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk and <b>Imperial</b> Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies.

5|$|During Western Han the <b>Imperial</b> Counselor, {{also known}} as the Grandee Secretary and <b>Imperial</b> Secretary, was {{considered}} the second-ranking official below the Chancellor. Like the Chancellor, he exercised censorial powers over provincial officials who also sent him annual reports. His primary duty was to uphold disciplinary procedures for officials; he could investigate even those attached to the chancellery and the <b>imperial</b> palace. Since one of his main functions was to prevent abuse of authority, his jurisdiction over officialdom tended to overlap with that of the Chancellor's. His subordinates included the <b>Imperial</b> Clerks (Shiyushi 侍御史; {{also known as}} Attending Secretaries), led by the Palace Assistant <b>Imperial</b> Clerk (Yushi zhongcheng 禦史中丞; {{also known as the}} Palace Assistant Secretary). They were often sent out into the provinces to investigate possible wrongdoing on the part of local officials.|$|E
