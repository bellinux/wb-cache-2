Thirty-two patients, who received a biliary-enteric anatomosis for benign biliary disease were evaluated. Follow-up consisted of the patient's history, physical examination, determination of liver <b>function</b> <b>tests,</b> ultrasonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy using 99 mTc-HIDA. Median duration of follow-up was 45 months (range: 1 - 192) and liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> were elevated in 22 patients (69 %) at some time during follow-up. Dilated intrahepatic ducts were found in 3 of 30 patients (10 %), all of whom had elevated liver <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> at follow-up. Delayed passage from the liver was observed using scintigraphy in 10 (31 %) of the patients. Seven patients (22 %) experienced one episode of cholangitis and none experienced more than one episode.

At the same time, we have studied the role of potential modulating factors, such as the APOE genotype or physical exercise. University students enrolled in academic year 2013 - 2014 at Escuelas Universitarias Gimbernat-Cantabria, affiliated with the University of Cantabria, were {{invited to participate in the}} study. We gathered sociodemographic data and details regarding the lifestyle of 206 students (mean age 19. 55 ± 2. 39; 67. 5 % women). We evaluated memory and executive functions via a series of validated cognitive tests. Participants were classified as binge drinkers (BD) and non-BD. Using Student's t-distribution we studied the association between cognitive tests and BD patterns. Multivariate analyses were carried out via multiple linear regression. 47. 6 % of the students were found to be BD. The BD differed significantly from the non-BD in their results in the executive <b>functions</b> <b>test</b> TMT B (43. 41 ± 13. 30 vs 37. 40 ± 9. 77; p = 0. 0003).

40|$|Guidelines {{provide a}} Class IA {{recommendation}} {{for the use}} of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there is interindividual variability in the pharmacodynamic response to antiplatelet medications. Some patients present with a status of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) during platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> after standard doses of antiplatelet drugs, reflecting a failure to achieve adequate platelet inhibition. As an example, patients with HPR on clopidogrel are at increased risk for thrombotic events, particularly for stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, but cardiovascular mortality is also elevated. On the contrary, low on-treatment platelet reactivity or an enhanced response to antiplatelet medications has been linked to a higher risk for bleeding. Although both thrombotic and bleeding events are multifactorial in origin, there is supportive evidence for the prognostic value of platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> for risk prediction of both sides of the coin. However, although small studies have provided evidence that treatment adjustments based on platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> results may improve clinical outcomes, the available randomized controlled trials showed no benefit of modifying antiplatelet treatment based on platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing.</b> This review presents the current evidence regarding platelet <b>function</b> <b>testing</b> in patients undergoing PCI.

There was significant statistical difference on comparing the presence of respiratory symptoms between control group and weaving, spinning, opening of cotton bales and carding groups. Respiratory symptom was the highest prevalent in spinning and weaving workers. Cough, expectoration and chest tightness were the highest prevalent symptoms in cotton exposed groups.
