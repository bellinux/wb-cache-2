50|$|The <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are tree-living mammals from South and Central America. They are {{the only}} members of the genus Bradypus and the family Bradypodidae. The four living species of <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are the brown-throated sloth, the maned sloth, the pale-throated sloth, and the pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth.</b>|$|R
50|$|The maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), {{also known}} as the ai , is a <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> that lives only in Brazil. It is one of four species of <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Currently living sloths belong {{largely to}} two families, Megalonychidae ("two-toed" [...] <b>sloths)</b> and Bradypodidae (<b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths).</b> All living sloths {{have in fact}} three toes; the [...] "two-toed" [...] sloths, however, have only two fingers. Two-toed sloths {{generally}} move faster than <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b> Both types tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, one species of <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> and one species of the larger two-toed sloth will jointly predominate.|$|R

50|$|Male <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are {{attracted}} to females in estrus by their screams echoing throughout the canopy. Sloth copulation lasts an average of 25 minutes. Male <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are strongly polygamous, and exclude competitors from their territory. Males are also able to compete with one another within small habitable territories.|$|R
50|$|This sloth, {{like other}} sloths, is {{arboreal}} (tree-living) and feeds on leaves. It is symbiotically associated with green algae, {{that can provide}} it with a camouflage. Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented. The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudos de Veraguas, restricted to an area of 4.3 sqkm sq mi. A 2012 census of pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> estimated the total population at 79. The IUCN lists the pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> as critically endangered and they are listed on the world's 100 most threatened species.|$|R

50|$|The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth,</b> {{like others}} in its genus, is an {{arboreal}} (tree-living) animal. This sloth can spend {{as many as}} 15 to 20 hours per day on trees. It moves at an extremely slow speed of 0.15 mph, {{making it one of}} the slowest animals. The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is symbiotically related to green algae; a 2010 study investigated this in detail. Different sloths harbour different types of algae - only Tricophilus species were found on the brown-throated and pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b> These algae discolor the fur of the sloth, giving it a greenish hue - this serves as an efficient camouflage. Some of these algae might be transferred to offspring through the mother, others may be picked up from the surroundings over time. The smaller size of pygmy sloths reduces their energy requirements for survival and reproduction, making them an apparent example of insular dwarfism. A BBC documentary, in which English naturalist Chris Packham recognizes the pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> as the first in his list of the top ten discoveries in the 2000s, shows a rare clip of a swimming pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth.</b>|$|R

50|$|The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus pygmaeus), {{also known}} as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, is a sloth endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama. The species was first {{described}} by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is significantly smaller than the other three members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown-throated <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth.</b> According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between 48 and 53 cm, and the body mass ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 kg.|$|R

Besides these, the blood-sucking mites Liponissus inheringi, Lobalges trouessarti and Edentalges bradypus have been reported from <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> collected in southern Brazil. The mite Edentalges choloepi has also been recorded on Choloepus didactylus.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{unable to}} survive outside the {{tropical}} rainforests of South and Central America, within that environment sloths are outstandingly successful creatures. On Barro Colorado Island in Panama, sloths have been estimated to comprise 70% of {{the biomass of}} arboreal mammals. Four of the six living species are presently rated [...] "least concern"; the maned <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus torquatus), which inhabits Brazil's dwindling Atlantic Forest, is classified as [...] "vulnerable", while the island-dwelling pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (B. pygmaeus) is critically endangered.|$|R

50|$|Although {{similar to}} the {{somewhat}} smaller and generally slower-moving <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> (Bradypus), {{the relationship between the}} two genera is not close. Recent phylogenetic analyses support analysis of morphological data from the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting the two genera are not closely related and each adopted its arboreal lifestyle independently. It is unclear from which, if any, ground-dwelling <b>sloth</b> taxa the <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> evolved; the two-toed sloths appear to nest phylogenetically within one of the divisions of Caribbean megalonychids, and thus probably either descended from them or are part of a clade that invaded the Caribbean multiple times. Though data has been collected on over 33 different species of sloths just by analyzing bone structures, many of the relationships between clades on a phylogenetic tree are unknown. Both types tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, a particular species of <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> and a single species of the larger two-toed type will jointly predominate.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The researchers {{noted that the}} <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small {{island off the coast}} of Panama, are significantly smaller than those that occur on the nearby outer islands of Bocas del Toro Province. Moreover, they differ from other populations in terms of pelage and cranial characteristics. Hence, they considered the <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> in Isla Escudo de Veraguas to be an independent species and formally described it from the skin and skull of an adult female. The researchers further pointed out that Isla Escudos de Veraguas is the oldest island and located farthest from the mainland, that began breaking up into small islands due to rises in sea levels 10,000 years ago. They proposed that this species evolved from an isolated population that had originated from the mainland population of brown-throated three-toed sloths; it gradually differentiated enough to become an independent species through insular dwarfism. In another study the following year, the researchers observed that the mean body size of <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> on an island decreases linearly as the age of the island increases; the area of the island and the distance from the mainland, however, do not appear to significantly affect dwarfing.|$|R

25|$|Sloths have short, flat heads, big eyes, short snouts, stout bodies, long limbs, {{and tiny}} ears. <b>Three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> also have stubby tails about 5-6 cm long. Sloths {{are about the}} size of small dogs, with the head and body having a {{combined}} length of 50 to 70cm. Almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, including those with very short necks, such as elephants and cetaceans, and those with very long necks, such as giraffes and camels. The few exceptions include manatees and two-toed sloths, which have only six cervical vertebrae, and <b>three-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> with nine cervical vertebrae.|$|R
