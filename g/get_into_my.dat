500|$|Three singles were {{released}} from the album. [...] "Play with Fire" [...] was released as the first single on August 21, 2006 which Duff {{considered to be a}} [...] "tease" [...] of Dignitys musical sound. Although she felt it was different from the album's other songs, she saw it as embodying the dance/electro/rock combination of the album, which influenced her decision to release it. Duff opted to release the song well in advance of the album [...] "to give listeners a chance to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> new sound". Though it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, it charted on the magazine's Hot Dance Club Play chart, peaking at number 34. It was later released as a digital-only single on May 15, 2007 in a remixed form of the original version, with production by Richard Vission. The second single, [...] "With Love" [...] became her highest-peaking single on the Hot 100 when it reached number 24. The single reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The third and final single, [...] "Stranger", peaked at 97 on the Hot 100 and also {{reached the top of the}} dance charts.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2013, a {{video of}} Gwar {{covering}} Billy Ocean's [...] "Get Outta My Dreams, <b>Get</b> <b>Into</b> <b>My</b> Car" [...] was posted by The A.V. Club. The song was blended into a medley featuring the Who's [...] "Baba O'Riley".|$|E
2500|$|Mnemonic rhymes have {{sometimes}} failed. [...] Jean-Jacques Rousseau once complained of [...] "those Ostrogothic verses {{that made me}} sick to my heart and could not <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> ear". Other children regarded the mnemonics more favourably, setting them to familiar tunes. Edward Hornby would recite the following, which he described as [...] "little pearls of poetry", {{to the tune of}} the hymn [...] "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling": ...|$|E

2500|$|The early Game Theory was {{described}} as a [...] "pseudo-psychedelic pop quartet" [...] for which Miller sang and wrote [...] "almost all of the material." [...] On the first three releases, Miller shared co-writing credits on [...] "The Young Drug" [...] with Alternate Learning's Carolyn O'Rourke, and on [...] "Life in July" [...] with Nancy Becker. Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular. We all had the impression that no one was ever going to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> stuff and that his one or two would be the ones to catapult us to fame." ...|$|E
