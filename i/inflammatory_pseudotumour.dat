40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> of {{the lung}} is a lesion mainly {{composed}} of histiocytes. Histiocyte accumulation {{may arise from}} local proliferation of migratory cells, from cytokine induced recruitment of monocytes from the systemic circulation, or both. Cell proliferation was investigated with Ki- 67 immunostaining and cytokine production with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in two cases of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> of the lung. It {{was found that the}} two lesions were composed mainly of non-proliferating (Ki- 67 non-binding) macrophages that stained positive for CD 68, CD 14, CD 4, and mannose receptor. Both cases contained mRNA transcripts for monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1), a monocyte chemoattractant, and for interleukin 6 (IL- 6), an inducer of plasma cell differentiation. One of the two cases also contained mRNA transcripts for IL- 8, a neutrophil chemoattractant. These findings are consistent with the possibility that accumulation of non-proliferating histiocytes induced by MCP- 1 is one of the pathogenic events occurring in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> of the lung...|$|E

Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 6 -cm mass in the spleen. Following a renal biopsy, a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I was made.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the clinicopathological and immunophenotypical findings of two cases of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> {{in the oral}} cavity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The patients presented with a short history of swelling in the cheek and the maxilla respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging or computerised tomography scan showed space occupying lesions with infiltrative margins which were interpreted as aggressive malignant neoplasms. Histological examination showed fascicles of spindle cells in a background of chronic reactive inflammatory cells including plasma cells, typical of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour.</b> The spindle cells were positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin and CD 68, but were negative for follicular dendritic cell markers. The lymphocytes showed no light chain restriction. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> in the oral cavity is completely benign and simple excision is curative. However, it may be confused with a malignant tumour on clinical and radiographic grounds, and histologically the appearances can also be misinterpreted as those of a more aggressive lesion. Its correct recognition by the surgical pathologist is important to avoid unnecessarily radical and potentially mutilating surgery...|$|E

A 37 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome with first trimester miscarriage and recurrent pulmonary embolism treated with warfarin, underwent an abdominal ultrasound (US) which revealed on the right liver multiple oval hypoechoic lesions (mean diameter 10 – 20 mm); after sulphur hexafluoride injection, lesions displayed centripetal arterial enhancement and early wash out. She denied symptoms. Liver function tests were normal, as well as tests for HBsAg, anti-HCV and autoimmune diseases. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 73 mm/h and Protein C reactive was 39 mg/L. An MRI showed (Fig. 1) multiple T 2 -hyperintense lesions that have restricted diffusion on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging. The vascular study demonstrated a peripheral arterial enhancement with delayed central uptake, while the hepatospecific phase showed no enhancement. Liver biopsy showed fibrovascular tissue embedding biliary ducts and infiltrated by lymphocytes, plasma cells and granulocytes. During a quarterly follow-up, MRI revealed that some lesions spontaneously were reduced or even disappeared but other enlarged or appeared. A final diagnosis of an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumour</b> of the liver was made. At present, patient continues to be asymptomatic.

40|$|Radiotherapy {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to steroid therapy for idiopathic <b>inflammatory</b> orbital <b>pseudotumours.</b> Twenty-four orbits were treated with radiotherapy, of which 75 % responded adequately. There were no significant complications and no recurrences during the average follow-up time of 22. 3 months (1 - 50 months).

An adequate response to radiotherapy can be predicted if lymphocytes with germinal centres are present in biopsy specimens. Polymorphonuclear leucocytes and eosinophils suggest a poor response to radiotherapy. Small, discrete, inflammatory masses respond better than large diffuse masses.

40|$|Alterations in {{transforming}} growth factor (TGF) -beta signalling have been frequently implicated in human cancer, {{and an important}} mechanism underlying its pro-oncogenic pature is suppression of the host antitumour immune response. Considering the immunosuppressive effect of TGF-beta, we asked whether human turnout cells, known to secrete TGF-beta in culture, would survive and grow when implanted into the peritoneal cavity of immunocompetent mice. Therefore, we developed a xenogeneic model where mice were intraperitoneally (i. p.) injected with a TGF-beta-secreting human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, LISP-A 10. Although animals did not develop macroscopic tumouts, the recovery and isolation of human turnout cells was achieved when an inflammatory environment was locally induced by the administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). This procedure significantly increased TGF-beta concentrations in the peritoneal fluid and was accompanied by impaired activation of the host-specific immune response against LISP-A 10 cells. Furthermore, inflammatory lesions resembling human <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumours</b> (IPTs) were observed {{on the surface of}} i. p. organs. These lesions could be induced by either injection of LlSP-A 10 cells, cells-conditioned medium or recombinant TGF-beta but only after administration of CFA. in addition, host cyclooxygenase- 2 and kinin receptors {{played an important role in}} the induction of TGF-beta-mediated IPT-like lesions in our experimental model.

30|$|The orbit {{is a small}} {{anatomical}} {{space with}} a wide range of important structures within. Tumours and tumour-like lesions often arise from these orbital contents and are a common indication for the radiological evaluation of the orbit in both adults and children. Cross-sectional imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of these lesions. Knowledge of the clinical presentation and patient’s age helps to limit the differential diagnosis and to determine the appropriate imaging modality. Certain orbital pathologies such as retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are typically found in children, whereas malignant uveal melanoma, lymphoma, and <b>inflammatory</b> orbital <b>pseudotumour</b> (IOP) are seen in adults. Clinical symptoms such as extraocular muscle palsies, diplopia, visual impairment, exophthalmos, and eye pain can serve as useful pointers to the likely pathology.

40|$|Metal-on-metal hip {{resurfacing}} {{is commonly}} performed for osteoarthritis in young active patients. We have observed cystic or solid masses, {{which we have}} called <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumours,</b> arising around these devices. They may cause soft-tissue destruction with severe symptoms and a poor outcome after revision surgery. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for pseudotumours that are serious enough to require revision surgery. Since 1999, 1419 metal-on-metal hip resurfacings have been implanted by our group in 1224 patients; 1. 8 % of the patients had a revision for pseudotumour. In this series the Kaplan-Meier cumulative revision rate for pseudotumour increased progressively with time. At eight years, in all patients, it was 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 2 to 5. 8). Factors significantly associated with an increase in revision rate were female gender (p < 0. 001), age under 40 (p = 0. 003), small components (p = 0. 003), and dysplasia (p = 0. 019), whereas implant type was not (p = 0. 156). These factors were inter-related, however, and on fitting a Cox proportional hazard model only gender (p = 0. 002) and age (p = 0. 024) had a significant independent influence on revision rate; size nearly reached significance (p = 0. 08). Subdividing the cohort according to significant factors, we found that the revision rate for pseudotumours in men was 0. 5 % (95 % CI 0 to 1. 1) at eight years whereas in women over 40 years old it was 6 % (95 % CI 2. 3 to 10. 1) at eight years and in women under 40 years it was 13. 1 % at six years (95 % CI 0 to 27) (p < 0. 001). We recommend that resurfacings are undertaken with caution in women, particularly those under 40 years of age but they remain a good option in young men. Further work is required to understand the aetiology of pseudotumours so that this complication can be avoided...|$|R
40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumours</b> {{occasionally}} occur after metal-on-metal hip resurfacing {{and often}} lead to revision. Our aim {{was to determine the}} severity of this complication by assessing the outcome of revision in these circumstances and by comparing this with the outcome of other metal-on-metal hip resurfacing revisions {{as well as that of}} matched primary total hip replacements. We identified 53 hips which had undergone metal-on-metal hip resurfacing and required revision at a mean of 1. 59 years (0. 01 to 6. 69) after operation. Of these, 16 were revised for pseudotumours, 21 for fracture and 16 for other reasons. These were matched by age, gender and diagnosis with 103 patients undergoing primary total hip replacement with the Exeter implant. At a mean follow-up of three years (0. 8 to 7. 2) the outcome of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing revision for pseudotumour was poor with a mean Oxford hip score of 20. 9 (sd 9. 3) and was significantly worse (p < 0. 001) than the outcome for fracture with a mean Oxford hip score of 40. 2 (sd 9. 2) or that for other causes with a mean Oxford hip score of 37. 8 (sd 9. 4). The clinical outcome of revision for pseudotumour was also significantly worse (p < 0. 001) than the outcome of matched primary total hip replacements. By contrast, the outcome for fracture and other causes was not significantly different from that of matched primary total hip replacements (p = 0. 065). After revision for pseudotumour there were three cases of recurrent dislocation, three of palsy of the femoral nerve, one of stenosis of the femoral artery and two of loosening of the component. Five hips required further revision. In three of these there was evidence of recurrent pseudotumour, and one is currently awaiting further revision. The incidence of major complications after revision for pseudotumour (50 %) was significantly higher (p = 0. 018) than that after revision for other causes (14 %). The outcome of revision for pseudotumour is poor and consideration should be given to early revision to limit the extent of the soft-tissue destruction.
