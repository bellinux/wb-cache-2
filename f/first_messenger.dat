500|$|In 1919 Brigadier General William Mitchell {{requested}} the Engineering Division {{to design a}} light-weight [...] "motorcycle of the air" [...] that could operate as a liaison between Army field units. Verville completed the Messenger design in early 1920. The Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Company of Farmingdale was contracted to build five Messengers in April 1920. The <b>first</b> <b>Messenger</b> flight was on November 1. Later designated the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger, the plane is notable for its small size, simple construction, and inexpensive cost, which made it ideal for testing and experimentation. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics used one in its pioneering aerodynamic research programs from 1923 to 1929. Sperry modified twelve into the radio-controlled Messenger Aerial Torpedo and developed the apparatus for a Messenger {{to make the first}} successful airship hook on and release in December 1924.|$|E
2500|$|At that time, it {{took two}} to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the {{shortest}} duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg. [...] The <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening. [...] The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday. [...] Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information. [...] The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.312–313 and in Chapter 31 of The Swedenborg Epic. According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.|$|E

[...] These signaling molecules include the primary metabolites cyclic nucleotides, diacyl glycerol etc.|$|R
2500|$|Cyclic {{nucleotides}} {{are integral}} to a communication system that acts within cells. [...] They act as [...] "second messengers" [...] by relaying the signals of many <b>first</b> <b>messengers,</b> such as hormones and neurotransmitters, to their physiological destinations. Cyclic nucleotides participate in many physiological responses, including receptor-effector coupling, down-regulation of drug responsiveness, protein-kinase cascades, and transmembrane signal transduction.|$|R
25|$|<b>First</b> <b>messengers</b> are the {{signaling}} molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters, and paracrine/autocrine agents) {{that reach}} the cell from the extracellular fluid and bind to their specific receptors. Second messengers are the substances that enter the cytoplasm and act within the cell {{to trigger a}} response. In essence, second messengers serve as chemical relays from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, thus carrying out intracellular signal transduction.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Let us talk,' he said.

In the sunshine came the spinster. But as she talked, over the hilltop rose the wide forehead of the cloud, rearing slowly, ominously higher.

50|$|Cyclic {{nucleotides}} act {{as second}} <b>messengers</b> when <b>first</b> <b>messengers,</b> which cannot enter the cell, instead bind to receptors in the cellular membrane.

This releases cAMP into the cell interior, where it stimulates a protein kinase called cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. By phosphorylating proteins, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase alters protein activity. cAMP's role in this process terminates upon hydrolysis to AMP by phosphodiesterase.|$|R

He would have me consigned to my quarters for several days at a time; then invite me to his tipsy supper-table, quarrel with me there, and abuse my nation; or again break out into maudlin sentimentalities about his native country of Normandy, where he longed to spend his old age, to buy a field or two, and to die happy.|$|E
60|$|The horses {{arrive in}} about an hour. In the interval, the driver swears; {{sometimes}} Christian oaths, sometimes Pagan oaths. Sometimes, when it is a long, compound oath, he begins with Christianity and merges into Paganism.

At length the horses appear, surrounded by all the messengers; some kicking them, and some dragging them, and all shouting abuse to them. Then, the old priest, the young priest, the Avvocato, the Tuscan, and all of us, take our places; and sleepy voices proceeding from the doors of extraordinary hutches in divers parts of the yard, cry out 'Addio corriere mio!

40|$|Cell communication, an {{essential}} component of integrated physiological function in multicellular organisms, is mediated largely through informational molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. After binding to specific receptors, these <b>first</b> <b>messengers</b> activate intracellular signaling cascades and, thereby, translate extracellular messenger levels into intracellular events. Atrial fibrillation is associated with significant electrophysiological and structural alterations of atrial tissue. Most of these changes seem to be related to activation of signal transduction systems at the molecular atrial level.

[...] A youth, by name Don Bernardo Collagon, stripped himself of his shirt to make bandages {{for one of those}} Englishmen against whom, not an hour before, he had been engaged in battle. Nelson wrote to thank the governor for the humanity which he had displayed. Presents were interchanged between them.

60|$|I had no {{design to}} hang the poor fellow, it is true, and the {{boatswain}} knew that well enough. However, I was resolved to humble him effectually, so I sent back two {{men to the}} boatswain, the first was to tell the boatswain aloud that the captain was resolved to have the fellow hanged, for having been so impudent to threaten to run the ship aground; but then the second, who was to stay a little behind, was to call out, as if he came since the first from me, and that I had been prevailed with to pardon him, on his promises of better behaviour. This was all acted to admiration; for the <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> called aloud to the boatswain, that the captain {{said he would have}} the Dutchman hanged for a warning to all pilots, and to teach them not to insult men when they are in difficulties, as the midwives do whores in labour, and will not deliver them till they confess who is the father.|$|E
60|$|The groom, {{being the}} <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> whom Durward had {{despatched}} from Schonwaldt, was now introduced with his letters. They were {{addressed to the}} King by the Ladies of Croye, and barely thanked him in very cold terms for his courtesy while at his Court, and something more warmly for having permitted them to retire and sent them in safety from his dominions; expressions at which Louis laughed very heartily, instead of resenting them. He then demanded of Charlot, with obvious interest, whether they had not sustained some alarm or attack upon the road? Charlot, a stupid fellow, and selected for that quality, gave a very confused account of the affray in which his companion, the Gascon, had been killed, but knew of no other. Again Louis demanded of him, minutely and particularly, the route which the party had taken to Liege; and seemed much interested when he was informed, in reply, that they had, upon approaching Namur, kept the more direct road to Liege, upon the right bank of the Maes, instead of the left bank, as recommended in their route. The King then ordered the man a small present, and dismissed him, disguising the anxiety he had expressed as if it only concerned {{the safety of the}} Ladies of Croye.|$|E
40|$|Various <b>first</b> <b>messengers</b> {{linked to}} {{phospholipase}} C, including acetylcholine and interleukin 1, regulate the production {{both of the}} secreted form of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) and of amyloid beta-protein. We have now identified intracellular signals which are responsible for mediating these effects. We show that activation of phospholipase C may affect APP processing by either of two pathways, one involving an increase in protein kinase C and the other an increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels. The effects of calcium on APP processing appear to be independent of protein kinase C activation. The observed effects of calcium on APP processing may be of therapeutic utility...|$|R

60|$|In {{the early}} spring I have {{utilized}} this habit of the crows in my search for owls' nests. The crows are much more apt to discover its whereabouts than the most careful ornithologist, and they gather about it frequently for a little excitement. Once I utilized the habit for getting {{a good look at}} the crows themselves. I carried out an old stuffed owl, and set it up on a pole close against a great pine tree on the edge of a grove. Then I lay down in a thick clump of bushes near by and cawed excitedly. The <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> from the flock flew straight over without making any discoveries. The second one found the owl, and I had no need for further calling. Haw! haw! he cried deep down in his throat--here he is! here's the rascal! In a moment he had the whole flock there; and for nearly ten minutes they kept coming in from every direction. A more frenzied lot I never saw. The hawing was tremendous, and I hoped to settle at last the real cause and outcome of the excitement, when an old crow flying close over my hiding place caught sight of me looking out through the bushes. How he made himself heard or understood in the din I do not know; but the crow is never too excited to heed a danger note. The next moment the whole flock were streaming away across the woods, giving the scatter-cry at every flap.|$|E
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> {{that came}} to us was from our friends at Bolton, to inform us that they were {{preparing}} at Manchester to attack us. One of our parties had been as far as Stockport, {{on the edge of}} Cheshire, and was pursued by a party of the enemy, but got off by the help of the night. Thus, all things looked black to the south, we had resolved to march northward in the morning, when one of our scouts from the side of Manchester, assured us Sir Thomas Middleton, with some of the Parliament forces and the country troops, making above 1200 men, were on the march to attack us, and would certainly beat up our quarters that night. Upon this advice we resolved to be gone; and, getting all things in readiness, we began to march about two hours before night. And having gotten a trusty fellow for a guide, a fellow that we found was a friend to our side, he put a project into my head which saved us all for that time; and that was, to give out in the village that we were marched to Yorkshire, resolving to get into Pontefract Castle; and accordingly he leads us out of the town the same way we came in, and, taking a boy with him, he sends the boy back just at night, and bade him say he saw us go up the hills at Blackstone Edge; and it happened very well, for this party were so sure of us, that they had placed 400 men {{on the road to the}} northward to intercept our retreat that way, and had left no way for us, as they thought, to get away but back again.|$|E
60|$|Quite one of {{the loveliest}} designs of the series. It was a {{favourite}} subject with Giotto; meeting, in all its conditions, his love of what was most mysterious, yet most comforting and full of hope, in the doctrines of his religion. His joy in {{the fact of the}} Resurrection, his sense of its function, as the key and primal truth of Christianity, was far too deep to allow him to dwell on any of its minor circumstances, as later designers did, representing the moment of bursting the tomb, and the supposed terror of its guards. With Giotto the leading thought is not of physical reanimation, nor of the momentarily exerted power of breaking the bars of the grave; but the consummation of Christ's work in the first manifesting to human eyes, and the eyes of one who had loved Him and believed in Him, His power to take again the life He had laid down. This first appearance to her out of whom He had cast seven devils is indeed the very central fact of the Resurrection. The keepers had not seen Christ; they had seen only the angel descending, whose countenance was like lightning: for fear of him they became as dead; yet this fear, though great enough to cause them to swoon, was so far conquered at the return of morning, that they were ready to take money-payment for giving a false report of the circumstances. The Magdalen, therefore, is the first witness of the Resurrection; to the love, for whose sake much had been forgiven, this gift is also first given; and as the first witness of the truth, so she is the <b>first</b> <b>messenger</b> of the Gospel. To the Apostles it was granted to proclaim the Resurrection to all nations; but the Magdalen was bidden to proclaim it to the Apostles.|$|E
