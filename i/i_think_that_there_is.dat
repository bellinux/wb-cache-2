2500|$|Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a real need, in {{formalism}} and elsewhere, to link {{our understanding}} of mathematics with {{our understanding of}} the physical world. [...] (A. Robinson) ...|$|E
2500|$|Penrose is an atheist. In {{the film}} A Brief History of Time, he said, [...] "I think I {{would say that}} the {{universe}} has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along â€“ it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful {{way of looking at the}} universe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something much deeper about it." [...] Penrose is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.|$|E
2500|$|In {{their early}} years, Depeche Mode were {{considered}} teen idols, and regularly featured on front covers of magazines such as Smash Hits. Following {{the departure of}} Vince Clarke, their music began {{to take on a}} darker tone akin to that found in gothic rock, as Martin Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore's lyrical artistry has been recognised as encapsulating themes such as sex, religion, and politics, so much so that many labelled the band's lyrical and musical themes as dark and bleak. In response, Gore has stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness present more of a realistic character and are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds [...] "happy songs" [...] fake and unrealistic: [...] "I've never seen our music as being over-dark. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always an element of hope in our music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Letters {{from men}} who call {{themselves}} lovers to young girls. It would be safer, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> shouldn't be any;--very much safer." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "An unsuspecting person, passing {{from the}} toilet rooms upstairs, {{could easily be}} induced to enter. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be another exit from that room. Yes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that would}} be a very good story, Terence, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be no great fear, even if we were to go boldly into a town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Leo to me nervously in {{the silence}} that followed, and {{speaking}} in English, [...] "now I wish we were somewhere else, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, to {{hear you}} say so, Albert. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no reason to doubt that you will {{continue}} to gain strength, and will prove worthy of your name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{there is}} no doubt of that," [...] I said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> danger of her taking more {{interest}} in such extraordinary and novel duties than in the regular work of the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Humphrey," [...] she {{answered}} gently. [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no death, and, having done no wrong, I dread no evil. I had dreams while I was asleep, O Humphrey, {{and it seemed}} to me that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The chances are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will {{be another}} dissolution. If they hold their own against Mr. Monk's motion, then they will pass an Irish Reform Bill. After <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they must dissolve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen to the drums!' said Wali Dad. 'That is {{the heart}} of the people--empty and making much noise. How, think you, will the Mohurrum go this year? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your are right, Mrs. Doolan," [...] the Doctor said; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are some}} who must regret now {{the manner in which}} they have behaved to Bathurst since this siege began." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet," [...] {{answered}} his wife. [...] "I {{have had the}} dressmaker here with my new dress for the duchess's ball to-morrow; it's lovely, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a little too much}} of that creamy lace about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] he said, after {{a slight}} pause, [...] "that I have {{finished}} altogether {{with the role}} of investigator. I no longer have any curiosity about anything. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something which I ought to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{hope you}} will be able to do this, because I value men friends. I shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a friend. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no better friend for a girl than a man rather older than herself.|$|E

6000|$|... "He and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{has been}} some mistake about that. You {{suggested}} the appointment to him, and he felt unwilling to raise an objection without giving the matter very mature consideration. You can understand that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As a rule, our {{men were}} always {{dissatisfied}} when they received orders to fall back, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was not a}} man among us but was heartily glad, when we were recalled to rejoin Catinat at Pignerolle." ...|$|R

"Of {{course it}} is," [...] said the Queen, [...] "and {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{not the slightest}} reason why every one should not feel the keenest interest in what the museum already contains, I am willing to add to it whatever may make it of greater value." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next to Keith and myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{one with}} whom the king can {{distract}} his mind so completely as with you. To him it is like getting a whiff of the fresh air from our Scottish hills. He told the surgeon {{to see that you}} were sent down with the first batch of wounded officers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Your remark is interesting,' he replied; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} paradoxical about it. I must {{be going}} now, as I have only five minutes to get to Westminster; but I will think it over, and answer it when we renew our conversation, which I propose to do very shortly,' {{and he was gone}} before I could get in another word." ...|$|E
5000|$|Arab-American comedian Ray Hanania has written, [...] "If {{there were}} a bit of humor in the Middle East, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{might not be so}} much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the {{environment}} that breeds fanaticism and terrorism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{does not}} know how many years ago,' said Dirkovitch facing the mess, 'but he says it was very long ago in the war. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an accident. He says he was of this glorious and {{distinguished}} regiment in the war.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be up an {{hour before}} daybreak; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be work for us tomorrow. If Unser and his tribe fail in {{capturing}} the temple we are to try; {{and there will be}} preparations to make." [...] And he explained the plan upon which he had determined.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Baas, but I {{have sent}} three stones over. Two crossed safely, I watched them go the whole way, and one {{vanished}} in the middle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a hole there, {{but we must}} risk that. If the stone is heavy enough it will jump it, if not, then we shall go down the hole and be no more troubled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't tell you, {{my dearest}} Father, what {{makes up the}} sum of my reasons for {{thinking}} that God is in His mercy bringing this dear boy to be the first-fruits of Mota unto the Christ, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an inward teaching going on now in his heart, which gives me sure hope, for I know {{it is not my}} doing.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{this talk}} more than {{anything}} else that had ever passed between them knit the two friends the closer together, for, as I have said, Myles felt easier now that he had poured out his bitter thoughts and words; and as for Gascoyne, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing so flattering to one's soul as to be made the confidant of a stronger nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed, [...] "we kept our word! That dear plucky little {{friend of yours}} turned the scale, {{but in any case}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would not have been much trouble about the matter. The {{magistrate}} had received a communication direct from the Home Secretary concerning your case." ...|$|R
5000|$|Look at the {{proposal}} {{that was put}} forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. I might not agree with every aspect of {{the proposal}}, but it took great courage to put forward something that is as significant as <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not," [...] he {{answered}} seriously. [...] "I love all beautiful things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many {{men as well}} as women who are like that. Shall I be very rude and say that in the matter of climate and flowers one grows, perhaps, to expect a little more in my own country." ...|$|R
