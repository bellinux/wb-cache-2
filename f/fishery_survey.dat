50|$|Hunt Lake harbors {{a vibrant}} fishery. The {{northern}} pike {{is at the}} top of the food chain, and considering it is such a small body of water, Hunt's pike are in balance with the forage available in the lake.

Bluegill, yellow perch, and emerald shiner make up the bulk of the forage base. A complete <b>fishery</b> <b>survey</b> had not yet been completed as of 2007. Strangely, a four-year-old muskellunge was identified in Hunt Lake in 2006, and it unclear if this fish was the sole representative of its species or if a small reproductive population exists.|$|E

As a result of Green's and Holt's work, the government instituted a formal program of fishery surveys under the auspice of the newly formed Congested Districts Board in 1892. Green became the board's Chief Inspector of Fisheries, while Holt participated as a scientific advisor, although he would leave Ireland for a few years.|$|E
