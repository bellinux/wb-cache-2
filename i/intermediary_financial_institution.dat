In Vietnam, the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Agribank) emerged from the mono-tier banking system in 1988 and performs as a profit-oriented commercial bank sustaining the development of rural areas. During the last two decades, the bank has clearly expanded its share of credit outstanding in total rural credit market volume and this process is in line with the trending development of the national economy. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether Agribank credit improves household income in the Northern Mountains of Vietnam, where the poor and ethnic minorities are overrepresented in the population. In order to create robust estimates, a joint consideration of all four matching algorithms (nearest-neighbor matching, radius matching, Kernel matching and stratification matching) is applied to the Propensity Score Matching. The study found that access to extension services, ethnicity, and total savings emerged as reliable predictors of credit access among household endowments. Loan volumes increase with total value of household assets. In addition, the impact of credit lies in the range increase of 14. 56 % to 43. 78 % of total income, 12. 09 % to 51. 83 % of per capita income and 43. 64 % to 111. 60 % of nonfarm income of household with credit access. The agricultural bank credit has contributed in improving household income in the Northern Mountains of Vietnam. Results in this study provide further support for the hypothesis that the remarkable progress in poverty reduction in the last two decades in Vietnam is partly attributed to the development of Agribank credit.

This research used the financial ratio which constituted the indicators of the CAMELS factors. Those ratios are CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio), NPL (Non Performing Loans), ROA (Return On Assets), ROE (Return On Equity), NIM (Net Interest Margin), BOPO (Operational Cost towards Operational Revenue), and LDR (Loan to Deposit Ratio).
