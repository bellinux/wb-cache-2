5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{received}} {{notification of}} the accident at 10:10 AM EST and immediately sent investigators to Jamaica Bay to conduct an investigation. The <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was found on March 9 and sent to Washington for analysis. Public hearings were held at the International Hotel in New York on March 20–23, 1962.|$|E
5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} {{flight data recorder}} that recorded basic information about the aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The lack of <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> {{data for}} the last six minutes of the flight added {{significant}} complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
50|$|On May 8, Chinese {{search and}} rescue {{personnel}} detected signals from the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders.</b> Dalian authorities sent 51 divers to 17 different locations to find the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> of the plane. On 10 May, weak signals were detected by salvage workers. They also recovered a 15-meter section of the plane from the sea. On May 14, seven days after the disaster, the two <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> were retrieved from the seabed by searchers.|$|R

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 2137, 15 {{years after}} the {{disappearance}} of the Nostromo spacecraft, Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, is approached by the android Christopher Samuels of the Weyland-Yutani corporation. Samuels informs her that the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> of the Nostromo was recently located by a ship named the Anesidora and is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson Corporation, in orbit around the gas giant KG348. He offers her a place on the Weyland-Yutani team sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the courier ship Torrens, owned by captain Diane Verlaine. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. Ripley, Samuels, and Taylor attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from them and forced to enter the station on her own.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was not {{fitted with a}} <b>flight</b> <b>recorder,</b> the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee primarily relied on the wreckage pattern and the pilot's flight history for the investigation. On 1 July 2015, all of the ammunition and two engines from {{the aircraft}} were successfully removed from the crash site.|$|E

25|$|Both <b>flight</b> <b>{{recorder}}s,</b> {{the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) and the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> (FDR) were recovered in the afternoon following the crash and were subsequently sent to the Lufthansa Technik laboratories in Germany for analysis.|$|R
25|$|Contrary {{to initial}} news reports, which stated that both <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> have been {{successfully}} read-out, the investigation team determined that the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> are non-analyzable because the CVR was inoperative for the past nine {{days leading up to}} the crash and the FDR was mysteriously found to have only recorded the first 14 minutes of the flight after which it stopped recording.|$|R
25|$|The aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was {{recovered}} on 9 May after a search that was hampered {{by a strong}} underwater current that necessitated the fuselage to be anchored to the seabed. After examination, {{it was discovered that}} the contents of the recorder were encrypted in Chinese; as a result, the recorder was sent to China to be decrypted.|$|E
25|$|Simulation testing {{determined}} that pilot error {{was the cause}} as a braking force {{was found to have}} been applied by the chief pilot during takeoff. Using data from the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder,</b> it was determined the movement was only possible by pushing down on the brake pedals from the chief pilot's seat to push upwards on the control column. The investigating committee found evidence of the braking failure in the braking system.|$|E
25|$|During {{its initial}} descent towards its destination, the {{attendant}} reported {{that one of}} the cabin door's indicators was showing an unlocked condition. Shortly afterwards, the right hand rear door (the baggage door) opened, detached itself from its hinge mounts and became lodged on {{the leading edge of the}} right horizontal tailplane. Later reconstruction of the aircraft's flight path from <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> evidence indicated that cabin decompression occurred when it was in the vicinity of Market Bosworth.|$|E

25|$|The two {{survivors}} were engineer Laurent Tabako and a {{woman from}} Chad, both were admitted to a hospital. According to Tabako, the engines stopped before landing and the crew may have dumped too much fuel before an emergency landing. The witnesses reportedly did not hear the usual engine noise during the crash and saw no flames when the aircraft disintegrated. The aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> and voice recorder were recovered and an investigation was launched {{by the government of}} the Central African Republic.|$|E
25|$|All {{navigational aid}} systems at LAX were {{controlled}} {{and found to}} be working {{at the time of}} the accident. The <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was recovered using a remotely operated underwater vehicle and found to be intact. Flights and simulator tests were carried out by SAS, confirming that the recorded data could be simulated in an appropriate manner on schedule. As the aircraft was found airworthy and able to be flown, the bulk of the work of the investigation commission focused on operational procedures.|$|E
25|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was set up}} to {{investigate}} the crash. It concluded 'the most probable cause of the crash was a criminal act of sabotage perpetrated in the aircraft'. It also suggested that poisonous gases were released which incapacitated the passengers and crew, which would explain why no Mayday signal was given. There was also speculation into other facts involving the details of the investigation. A <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> (black box) was not located after the crash and previous C-130 aircraft did have them installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorders</b> (Black Boxes) {{generate}} {{data that}} is collected on an embedded memory device. A well-known difficulty with these devices {{is that the}} embedded memory device runs out of space. The worry of getting into this problematical situation compels the software of the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> to operate in a watchful mode- it constantly makes efforts to minimize the use of memory space; otherwise a larger <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> will be needed; however a larger <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> can be very problematic because <b>flight</b> data <b>recorders</b> have very rigorous requirements; therefore an enlargement is very expensive and costly. In this paper it is suggested to send the data to a remote cloud, so the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> memory device will be in actual fact unbounded...|$|R

25|$|Airbus Chief Strategy Officer Marwan Lahoud {{confirmed}} on 29 May that incorrectly {{installed engine}} control software caused the fatal crash. “The black boxes attest to {{that there are}} no structural defects , but we have a serious quality problem in the final assembly.” Two days earlier, Airbus CEO Tom Enders criticized Spanish agencies for withholding the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> data. “We {{would like to see the}} data and compare it with our hypothesis and proceed quickly to understand the causes of accident, so our aircraft can get back into the air,” he told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting in Amsterdam on May 27.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{commission was}} appointed, {{consisted of three}} regular members, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Eirik Sandberg, Police Inspector Johan Fr. Kielland and Pilot Eivind Veierstad, {{in addition to their}} secretary, Hans Georg Andersen. Arne Viik, an expert in aviation navigation, was appointed for the individual investigation. The commission's regular members were contacted at 17:00 {{on the day of the}} accident and they started their work immediately. The wreck was taken to Fornebu for investigation, the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was sent to Copenhagen and the altimeters were sent to the United States. They interviewed several hundred people, flew the flight with a similar aircraft in the same light and weather conditions and by February 1973 had collected more than two and a half meters of notes and documents. Because of the navigational errors, the commission test-flew the route several times. When the beacon was transmitting false signals and they followed them without correlating by other means, the commission's test flights gave a course that would have resulted in a crash, had they not aborted.|$|E
25|$|Two flight {{recorder}}s, {{the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by Sergey Shoygu, the Russian Minister of Emergency Situations. That evening, {{it was reported that}} the CVR recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers. A third <b>flight</b> <b>recorder,</b> a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April. The two Flight Management System (FMS) units were also recovered. The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, {{despite the fact that they}} were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units. It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, a complete picture of flight data emerged.|$|E
50|$|Recovery teams located {{one of the}} two <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> {{according}} to El Watan. Emergency services had recovered 76 bodies from the site.|$|R

50|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> {{either the}} cockpit voice <b>recorder</b> or the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder,</b> from the ATR 42, didn't provide any data {{as there were}} no {{electrical}} power {{at the time of}} the accident. Therefore, the NTSC could only retrieve the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> from the Boeing 737, which was supported with AC electrical power at the time. The NTSC stated that because the towed ATR 42 didn't have electrical power, none of the lights inside and outside the aircraft were on. Radio communication was also off, therefore the ground crew of the towed ATR 42 could only communicate to the Tower through the handheld radio communication.|$|R

500|$|The frenzied {{search for}} the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> in early April 2014, due to the 30-day battery life of the {{underwater}} locator beacons (ULBs) attached to them, brought attention to {{the limitations of the}} ULBs. The distance the signal from the ULBs can be detected from is , or [...] under favourable conditions. Even if the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> are located, the cockpit voice recorder memory has capacity to store only two hours of data, continuously recording over the oldest data. This length complies with regulations and it is usually only data from the last section of a flight that are needed to determine the cause of an accident. The events which caused Flight 370 to divert from its course and disappear happened more than two hours before the flight ended. Given these limitations and the importance of the data stored on <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> <b>Flight</b> 370 has brought attention to new technologies that enable data streaming to the ground.|$|R
