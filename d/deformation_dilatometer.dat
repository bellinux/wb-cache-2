40|$|The {{effect of}} {{additions}} of Nb, A 1 and Mo to Fe-C-Mn-Si TRIP steels {{on the final}} microstructure and mechanical properties after simulated thermomechanical processing (TMP) has been studied. Laboratory simulations of continuous cooling during TMP were performed using a quench <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer,</b> while laboratory simulations of discontinuous cooling during TMP were performed using a hot rolling mill. From this a comprehensive understanding of the structural and kinetic aspects of the bainite transformation in these types of TRIP steels has been developed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} clinching of steels {{is currently}} limited to tensile strength less than 800 N/mm and to {{elongation at fracture}} more than 14 %. To realise the clinching of high-strength steels, the sheet can be heated locally at the joint, to improve ductility. Thereby the material characteristics outside the joint should be maintained. This could be achieved by means of short-time laser heating. The short-time tempering behaviour of press hardened steel 22 MnB 5 has been analysed. The mechanical properties during a short-time heat treatment were investigated by thermo-mechanical analysis in a <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer.</b> Thereby laser-assisted clinching shall be established and an efficient form-closed and force-closed connection shall be produced. As a result, the press hardened steel 22 MnB 5 could be clinched by laser assistance {{for the very first}} time...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{transformation}} kinetics {{of a hot}} rolled transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel is investigated by means of in situ high energy X-ray diffraction. The samples are deformed and annealed according to the parameters of a hot rolling process in a <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer</b> installed in the synchrotron beamline. Simultaneously, the phase fraction and the carbon content in the remaining austenite were measured by X-ray diffraction. It is advantageous that the retained austenite (RA) can be measured without sample preparation, which usually results in unwanted strain-induced martensite transformation. This study shows that enough carbon enrichment of austenite {{can be achieved by}} forming carbide free bainite. However, too little fraction of the RA for the TRIP effect can be formed without the pre-deformation. The pre-deformation also promotes the decarburization of the bainitic ferrite especially at high temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collaborative}} project {{was to develop a}} standard practice for obtaining and archiving quantitative steel transformation kinetic data and thermal strain data. Two families of dilatometric equipment were employed to develop this standard practice for testing bar product steels. These include high-speed quenching and <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometers</b> and Gleeble{reg_sign} thermomechanical simulation instruments. Standard measurement, data interpretation and data reporting methods were developed and defined by the cross-industry QMST Consortium members consisting of steel-manufacturers, forgers, heat-treaters, modelers, automotive and heavy vehicle OEMs along with team expert technologists from the National Labs and academia. The team designed phase transformation experiments on two selected steel grades to validate the standard practices [...] a medium carbon grade SAE 1050 and an alloy steel SAE 8620. A final standard practice document was developed based on the two dilatometry methods, and was submitted to and approved by ASTM (available as A 1033 - 04). The standard practice specifies a method for measuring austenite transformation under no elastic stress or plastic deformation. These methods will be an enabler for the development and electronic archiving of a quantitative database for process modeling using computer simulation software, and will greatly assist endusers in developing accurate process and product simulations during the thermo-mechanical processing of bar and rod product steels...|$|R
30|$|The {{autogenous}} deformation {{was measured}} by a special measuring technique developed by Jensen and Hansen (Jensen and Hansen 1995). Linear measurements of autogenous <b>deformation</b> with digital <b>dilatometers</b> were performed. The dilatometric technique has been tested during years of research work on binder phases of HPC (Jensen and Hansen 2002; Jensen and Hansen 1995; Jensen and Hansen 1993; Jensen and Hansen 1999). A particular characteristic of this measuring technique is the encapsulation of the hardening cement-based material in a specially designed, corrugated polyethylene mould; this effectively prevents moisture loss and ensures insignificant restraint during the hardening of the specimen. The employed technique is computer-controlled, and allows measurements immediately after casting, but its use is limited to aggregates with maximum size of 2.5  mm. For this reason mortar specimens were used in this work.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios (S/A) on {{sintering}} characteristics and provides guidance for alleviating ash depositions in a large-scale circulation fluidized bed. Five synthetic coal ash (SCA) samples with different S/As were treated in a muffle furnace for 12 h at different temperatures (from 773 K to 1373 K, in 100 K intervals). The morphological and chemical results of the volume shrinkage ratio (VSR), thermal <b>deformation</b> analysis by <b>dilatometer</b> (DIL), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were combined to describe the sintering characteristics of different samples. The {{results showed that the}} sintering procedure mainly occurred in the third sintering stage when the temperature was over 1273 K, accompanied with significant decreases in the VSR curve. Excess SiO 2 (S/A = 4. 5) resulted in a porous structure while excess Al 2 O 3 (S/A = 0. 5) brought out large aggregations. The other three samples (S/A = 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5) are made up of an amorphous compacted structure and are composed of low fusion temperature materials (e. g., augite and wadsleysite.). Sintering temperatures first dramatically decrease to a low level and then gradually rise to a high level as S/A increases, suggesting that Al 2 O 3 -enriched additives are more effective than SiO 2 enriched additives in alleviating depositions...|$|R

40|$|Continuous and {{discontinuous}} cooling {{tests were}} performed using a quench <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer</b> {{to develop a}} comprehensive understanding of the structural and kinetic aspects of the bainite transformation in low carbon TRIP (transformation induced plasticity) steels {{as a function of}} thermomechanical processing and composition. Deformation in the unrecrystallised austenite region refined the ferrite grain size and increased the ferrite and bainite transformation temperatures for cooling rates from 10 to 90 K s - 1. The influence of niobium on the transformation kinetics was also investigated. Niobium increases the ferrite start transformation temperature, refines the ferrite microstructure, and stimulates the formation of acicular ferrite. The effect of the bainite isothermal transformation temperature on the final microstructure of steels with and without a small addition of niobium was studied. Niobium promotes the formation of stable retained austenite, which influences the mechanical properties of TRIP steels. The optimum mechanical properties were obtained after isothermal holding at 400 °C in the niobium steel containing the maximum volume fraction of retained austenite with acicular ferrite as the predominant second phase. <br /...|$|E

Sur un site tests nous avons obtenu 3 années d'enregistrement montrant les ondes de marées avec un niveau de bruit de 5 x 10 - 9 rad. Nous obtenons une stabilité {{maximale}} de 0. 1 urad/mois. Nous avons également observé les ondes de surface excitées par le seisme du Pérou Mw= 8. 4. Cependant, l'inconvénient principaldes inclinomètres longue base est la sensibilité des matériaux.

Depuis mi-avril 2003, nous obtenons une stabilité maximale de 1 urad/an en direction EO et une résolution de 10 - 9 rad sur les inclinomètres confirmée par l'observation de petites déformationsTilt and strain continuous monitoring started in October 2002 in the Trizonia island, in the Gulf of Corinth, {{in order to}} detect possible strain transients in the rift. The tiltmeter are 15 m long and buried in trenches {{at a depth of}} 2. 2 m. The strain is measured by a Sacks-Evertson dilatometer cemented in a borehole at a depth of 146 m, with a few 10 - 10 resolution at short period. A 1 h-lasting, 1, 5 (10 - 7 strain transient has been recorded on the dilatometer, related to a seismic swarm that occurred 15 km away. This anomaly was not observed, by neither the tiltmeters, nor by a large band seismometer (CMG 3), nor by some piezometers probably {{because of a lack of}} resolution of these instruments present in the Gulf. At this time, the resolution of the tiltmeters was only 10 - 8 rad, due to a perviousness in the presence of wind. Despite this, we have observed tidal waves with an amplitude of 10 - 7 rad. Since mid-April 2003, we have improved the resolution by a factor of 10 to 10 - 9 rad, wich is confirmed by the detection of deformations produced by the free oscillations of the Gulf, with an amplitude of 2 x 10 - 9 rad and period ranging between 8 and 40 minutes.

40|$|Abstract. Nickel Aluminum Bronze (NAB) alloys {{have been}} widely used in {{different}} kinds of machine parts where the superior resistance to corrosion and erosion in saltwater is needed. In this work, mechanical properties at high temperatures and microstructures of a NAB alloy were investigated. First, NAB specimens were prepared as an as-cast ingot and were subsequently heat-treated at 675 °C for 6 hours in order to improve microstructure and mechanical properties. The mechanical properties at high temperatures in form of the plastic flow curves of the NAB alloy were characterized by a <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer.</b> The NAB samples were compressed at high temperature and rapidly cooled down to room temperature. The deformation temperatures of 825 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C, a strain rate of 0. 01 s- 1, and a maximum compression strain of 0. 4 were considered. The influences of the temperature on flow behavior of the NAB alloy were investigated. The plastic stress-strain curves at different temperatures were compared with regard to the rate of material strain hardening and softening. It was found that the compression stresses decreased with increasing temperatures. Additionally, the resulted hardness and microstructures of the alloy after forming at high temperatures were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dilatometric {{measurements}} {{were used to}} design the processing parameters of two types of bainitic steels. The first type is a hypoeutectoid ultra fine bainite steel, for which the dilatometer was used to locate the temperature at which cementite is completely dissolved during intercritical annealing (TC). The intercritical annealing temperatures are then selected will above TC. To obtain the martensite start temperatures (MS), the steel is quenched to the room temperature (RT) from these selected temperatures and then the bainite transformation temperatures were selected to be well above MS. The dilatometer was then used to monitor the bainite transformation kinetics from which the required time frames for cessation of the bainitic reactions were estimated. In the second type, bimodal bainite had been produced in thermo-mechanically processed TRIP-steel. A <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer</b> is used to perform three deformation-steps before slow cooling to form approx. 30 % polygonal ferrite. The material was then rapidly cooled to the first bainite formation temperature. During this step, the dilatometer was used to monitor the bainite reaction from which the required time for 50 % decomposition of austenite is estimated. The martensite start of the undecomposed austenite was located by quenching to RT. The second bainite transformation step was then performed well above the new MSII to form a second generation of finer bainite...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of high strength pipeline steel grades is major concern {{for a large}} number of steel manufacturers. The mechanical properties of API high strength steel can be remarkably improved through proper alloy design and appropriate thermo-mechanical processing that can refine and homogenize the final microstructure. The API X 60 grades conventionally is of ferrite-pearlite microstructure. The high strength API X 80 grades is of acicular ferrite/Bainite microstructure. The present objective is to obtain the acicular ferrite/Bainite micro structural constituents in the given API-X 60 grade pipeline steel by thermo-mechanical processing. The thermo mechanical process involves heating to austenitization at 12000 C for 20 min followed by deformation at temperatures of 9000 C, 10000 C & 11000 C for different strain levels at 0. 4, 0. 8 & 1. 2 with constant strain rate of 2 sec- 1 in a <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer.</b> After hot deformation, the specimens were quenched in water to retain the state of hot deformed austenite. The metallographic and EBSD results reveal the formations of Acicular Ferrite in case of sample deformed at 9000 C which is reported to have good combinations of strength & toughness and there is formation of bainite and martensite at 10000 Cand 11000 C deformed samples respectively. The critical point of stress and strain regarding to occurrences of DRX (Dynamic Recrystallisation) at each temperature was calculated from the flow curves based on the order of stress-strain curve and also the fraction of recrystallised volume in the sample which basically deformed at high temperature is calculated...|$|E
40|$|A new {{generation}} of steels has been designed, which on transformation at low temperature (200 ¿ 350 °C), leads to a nano-scale microstructure, known as NANOBAIN. The microstructure consists of slender crystals of ferrite, whose controlling scale compares well with that of carbon nanotubes (20 ¿ 40 nm). These advanced steels present the highest strength/toughness combinations ever recorded in bainitic steels. Their properties are mainly {{a consequence of the}} formation of nanoscale bainitic ferrite plates at very low temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy observations have shown that plastic relaxation in the austenite adjacent to the bainite plates may control the final size of the bainitic ferrite plates. The dislocation debris generated in this process resists the advance of the bainitic ferrite¿austenite interface, the resistance being greatest for strong austenite. The yield strength of the austenite must then feature in any assessment of plate size. In this scenario, the plates are expected to become thicker at high temperatures because the yield strength of the austenite will then be lower. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the influence of yield strength of austenite to the nanoscale structural refinement of advanced bainitic steels. In this sense, in situ measurements of austenite strength before bainite formation using a <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer</b> Bähr 805 D have been performed in a medium carbon high silicon steel transforming at intermediate temperatures (325 ¿ 400 °C) to a submicron structure of bainite and in a high carbon high silicon steel transforming at low temperatures (200 ¿ 350 °C) to nanostructured bainite. The role of the transformation driving force on the bainite plate thickness will be also discussed.

40|$|New {{high-performance}} engine concepts for aerospace and automotive application {{enforce the}} development of lightweight intermetallic γ-TiAl based alloys with increased high-temperature capability above 750 °C. Besides an increased creep resistance, the alloy system must exhibit sufficient hot-workability. However, the majority of current high-creep resistant γ-TiAl based alloys suffer from poor workability, whereby grain refinement and microstructure control during hot-working are key factors to ensure a final microstructure with sufficient ductility and tolerance against brittle failure below the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature. Therefore, a new and advanced β-solidifying γ-TiAl based alloy, a so-called TNM alloy with a composition of Ti– 43 Al– 4 Nb– 1 Mo– 0. 1 B (at%) and minor additions of C and Si, is investigated by means of uniaxial compressive hot-deformation tests performed with a Gleeble 3500 simulator within a temperature range of 1150 – 1300 °C and a strain rate regime of 0. 005 – 0. 5 s− 1 up to a true deformation of 0. 9. The occurring mechanisms during hot-working were decoded by ensuing constitutive modeling of the flow curves by a novel phase field region-specific surface fitting approach via a hyperbolic-sine law {{as well as by}} evaluation through processing maps combined with microstructural post-analysis to determine a safe hot-working window of the refined TNM alloy. Complementary, in situ high energy X-ray diffraction experiments in combination with an adapted quenching and <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer</b> were conducted for a deeper insight about the deformation behavior of the alloy, i. e. phase fractions and texture evolution as well as temperature uncertainties arising during isothermal and non-isothermal compression. It was found that the presence of β-phase and the contribution of particle stimulated nucleation of ζ-Ti 5 Si 3 silicides and h-type carbides Ti 2 AlC enhance the dynamic recrystallization behavior during deformation within the (α+β) phase field region, leading to refined and nearly texture-free α/α 2 -grains. In conclusion, robust deformation parameters for the refinement of critical microstructural defects could be defined for the investigated multi-phase γ-TiAl based alloy...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of Nb significantly retards recovery and recrystallization through solute drag and precipitation pinning effects. It {{is important to}} describe the precipitation behaviour precisely because finely distributed precipitates retard the restoration process abruptly. The isothermal precipitation behaviour has been studied frequently. However, during industrial hot deformation processing, the temperature decreases continuously, so that isothermal data cannot be applied directly to predict the precipitation under these conditions. The focus {{of this study is}} therefore on the CCP (Continuous-Cooling-Precipitation) behaviour of Nb carbonitride in austenite. To calculate the CCP behaviour, isothermal PTT (Precipitation-Time-Temperature) data in terms of the P$ sb{ rm s}$ (precipitation start) and P$ sb{ rm f}$ (precipitation finish) times are first required. In 1987, Dutta and Sellars developed a thermodynamic model to predict P$ sb{ rm s}$ times for the precipitation of niobium carbonitride, and in 1989, Liu and Jonas developed a model for titanium carbonitride. In the present work, the L-J (Liu-Jonas) model is used to calculate the P$ sb{ rm s}$ time at a given temperature from experimental data. Since the prediction models are only limited to the P$ sb{ rm s}$ times, a new calculation method for the P$ sb{ rm f}$ time, based on reaction kinetics and classical nucleation and growth theory, is proposed in this study. Two models are developed to follow the precipitation process, and the time exponent and rate constant for the kinetics are formulated for each model. The additivity rule, which was developed by Scheil in 1935, is then used to calculate the extent of precipitation during continuous cooling. Isothermal precipitation rates for 0. 040 % Nb steels are measured experimentally by the stress relaxation method. The CCP behaviour is then calculated and is then examined by continuous cooling testing, using a hot <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometer.</b> Precipitates are observed by transmission electron microscopy of specimens quenched after a period of cooling at various cooling rates. The P$ sb{ rm s}$ and P$ sb{ rm f}$ times estimated from the particle size data show good agreement with the calculated CCP behaviour...|$|E
