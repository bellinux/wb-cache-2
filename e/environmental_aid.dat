Student-led ensembles feature in concerts every year. Furthermore, each year the BGS Music Department performs an event known as the Grammar Community in Concert, typically at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music. This event brings together members from across the BGS Community, including the BGS Community Choir, incorporating parents, teachers, and friends. The school also has a thriving Drama program presenting a range of plays and musicals. In addition, opportunities in debating and public speaking are offered, with the school participating in Queensland Debating Union and Greater Public Schools annual competitions. Additionally, Brisbane Grammar School has recently revamped its participation in enterprise education groups. With the newly reformed Economics and Enterprise Club, students are gaining exciting experiences through external competitions such as YAA, Ecoman and ABW. An array of other special-interest groups exist, including those which focus on Chess, Astronomy, Aviation, Christianity, <b>Environmental</b> <b>aid,</b> and Community Service.|$|E

40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{political}} changes in Central and Eastern Europe {{in the late}} 1980 s, Denmark took steps {{to protect the environment}} in these areas and later made a strong commitment to step up its <b>environmental</b> <b>aid.</b> But the goals of Denmark's <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> policy for Central and Eastern Europe were until recently vague, ambiguous and somewhat conflicting. In fact, the <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> projects were the policy. There was little political agreement on what Denmark's <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> policy should support, the likely effects of the aid, or the receiving countries' needs. Recently, in response to evaluations and criticism, portions of the aid were redirected to establish a program-oriented strategy for various environmental sectors. Furthermore, more emphasis was put on participation and dissemination of useful experiences with environmental protection in Central and Eastern Europe. The article proposes to redesign Denmark's <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> policy by strengthening organization of the aid in receiving countries, and by specifying green principles for better granting aid. As well, it is proposed to make contextual environmental analyses {{at the level of the}} individual <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> projects. Most probably, an agreement on implementation and future operation of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> projects concluded at an early stage could enhance project sustainability by ensuring feasibility and increasing the lasting effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> projects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we update {{previous}} work that categorizes foreign aid projects {{in terms of}} their likely impact on the natural environment. We then document trends in the global distribution of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> over time and show that <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> has increasingly focussed on global environmental issues (especially climate change), rather than local issues in recipient countries. Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> is increasingly allocated through bilateral aid agencies rather than through the increasing number of multilateral channels created for this purpose. After providing these descriptive statistics and demonstrating trends, we offer a tentative explanation for this puzzling pattern. We argue that each individual aid project represents a negotiation between donor and recipient. This additional level of bargaining significantly conditions {{the costs and benefits of}} multilateralism for donors, especially as recipients have multiple outside options for obtaining development finance. Reflecting the growing political salience of global environmental threats, donors are providing increasing levels of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid,</b> and especially climate finance. However, at the same time, donors are increasingly failing to co-ordinate their allocation of climate finance (and other <b>environmental</b> <b>aid)</b> within multilateral institutions. At a practical level, this raises the question whether the effect of increasing levels of funding will be undercut by decreasing co-ordination and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>aid</b> {{has become}} a major {{component}} of foreign aid, as environmental degradation and climate change have arisen as global concerns. Japan contends it has committed itself to the protection of the global environment since the 90 s, and <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> has been an important part of that effort. South Korea has recently become an emerging actor in the development aid community and has also started to market its green diplomacy through programs such as the Global Green Growth Institute. Meanwhile, both Japanese aid and Korean aid have been criticized for being driven by their economic interests rather than altruism and that they focus too strongly on infrastructure projects. Against this background, we aim to analyze and compare Japanese and Korean <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> to shed light on the influence that emerging agents of aid such as South Korea can bring to the political dynamics and the overall governance of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid.</b> In our analysis, we refer to the definition of Williams (2002), which regards aid policy as an 'autobiography' of donor countries. Using an 'autobiography' approach we examine five elements of Japanese and Korean environmental aid: The bureaucratic and institutional imperatives, the internal procedures and processes, the stated policies, the practices and particular attitude that underlie them, and the broader impulse behind aid. By moving away from an altruistic/self-interest dichotomy, this analysis seeks to understand autobiographic trajectories of Japanese and Korean <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> rather than to evaluate them...|$|E

At the same time, we investigate whether economic development is affected by the receipt of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid.</b> Implicit in the second question, of course, is the notion that, besides addressing the ecological outcomes, <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> may have the potential to enhance the economic prosperity of poor countries.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} derives an empirically {{testable}} set of propositions on {{the determinants of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> as a non-market solution for trans-border pollution. The donor country balances environmental benefits against the social costs of aid which results from possible erosion of competitiveness in the export market. Using the panel data for <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> from OECD countries to China, it is shown that trade competition significantly reduces types of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> that enhance the competitiveness of China. As the scope of <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> that improves China's energy efficiency is limited by trade competition, the change in composition of bilateral <b>environmental</b> <b>aid</b> may reflect {{a means by which}} a solution to the trans-border pollution issue can be found. The second chapter shows that the dynamic properties of the pollution-income relationship under an optimal pollution tax depends on three key factors, namely the degree of temporal and inter-temporal flexibility in consumption and the elasticity of substitution among production inputs. This paper derives general conditions for eluding the limits to growth showing that they require rather stringent assumptions which the existing literature has failed to identify. Finally, the third chapter examines environmentally sustainable growth with reference to climate change assuming two final outputs and two factors of production, accounting for both pollution flow and stock effects. If the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is greater than one, an optimal pollution tax ensures sustainable growth without any further government intervention. Otherwise, either a high temporal elasticity of substitution in production or consumption is required for sustainability. Even a suboptimal pollution tax may allow sustainable development provided the tax time profile meets certain conditions that are developed and described in this paper...|$|E

30|$|The overall aim of CR is the {{improvement}} of impaired cognitive functions {{in order to increase}} psychosocial functioning and quality of life (Vauth et al. 2000). The basic principle of CR is the concept of neuronal plasticity of the brain. It is based on two main approaches: restitution (stimulation of cognition by repetitive exercise) and compensation (e.g. memorization skills, use of <b>environmental</b> <b>aids).</b> There is evidence that cognitive training in healthy persons can increase, e.g. synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and the efficiency of resting state metabolism in the frontal lobe (Valenzuela and Sachdev 2009). Therefore, CR could have positive effects on cognitive dysfunctions in patients with psychiatric disorders, who have difficulties in daily life due to cognitive deficits. Moreover, in the long-term, CR may even have a positive influence on the illness outcome of patients, as it might enable them to benefit from other interventions like psychoeducation and psychotherapy (Martinez-Aran et al. 2011). It has been demonstrated that noncompliance to psychopharmacological and psychological interventions is higher in patients with cognitive disturbances (Mago et al. 2014; Fagan et al. 2015), which might be a further indirect route how CR could improve outcome. Finally, there is evidence that an attentional training can foster neuronal networks that underlie executive control mechanisms, whereas emotion regulation could be improved indirectly by cognitive training (Raz and Buhle 2006).|$|R
