A US$75 million investment in a joint venture with the Communist Party government's primary commercial vehicle at the time, China International Trust & Investment Corporation (CITIC), was its purpose. Board members were major clients of Kissinger Associates. Kissinger was criticised for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by ABC's Peter Jennings to comment the morning after the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen crackdown. Kissinger's position was generally supportive of Deng Xiaoping's clearance of the square and he opposed economic sanctions.|$|E
5000|$|As a local policy {{formulated}} {{against the}} specific historical context of Hong Kong, the Small House Policy has brought some {{positive effects on}} both Hong Kong society and the British Colonial Government (and Chinese Central Government after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong). The impact could be divided into three categories. For the colonial government, the Small House Policy helped to ease off {{the tension between the}} government and the indigenous inhabitants, and facilitated the land development of the New Territories. Before the engagement of the colonial government, the indigenous inhabitants held the right to private ownership of the land in the New territories, with the permanent land contracted conferred by Qing (...) and Ming (...) government. Through the exchange of [...] "Ding" [...] for ownership, the colonial government lowered the law-enforcement cost in the process of land ownership transformation, and provided opportunities for the current economic development of the New territories. After handover, according to Article 40 of the Basic Law, [...] "the lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the 'New Territories' shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", the Small House Policy is reasserted by the Chinese Central Government, which helps the Chinese Central Government to win the support of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants to consolidate their rule in Hong Kong, and to show their respect to the traditional norms and culture of Hong Kong. For the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, their benefits are substantial. Firstly, the inhabitants enjoy a hereditary privilege of land usage and housing grant, which is a great advantage regarding Hong Kong's population density and land shortages. Secondly, according to Lands Department of Hong Kong, after a five-year period, the villager can freely sell his property in the market without any restriction. After the grant of ownership transfer, the Small House Policy created huge and <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> for the indigenous inhabitants. These benefits help to create a sense of pride and belonging to the indigenous villages which are useful in forging a bond among the indigenous villagers and to preserve their tradition. [...] For Hong Kong society as a whole, the Small House Policy also brings some benefits. The policy, to a certain extent, guaranteed a sense of land security against environment pollution and over-exploration, and protected the original natural environment of New Territory during the urbanization and industrialization of Hong Kong. Under the Small House Policy and [...] "Village Type Development" [...] project, the villages in New Territories could keep their traditional lifestyle and features until now.|$|E

The framers of Article III, which grants jurisdiction over “cases and controversies” to the federal courts, would have seen the latter day business corporation as something of an oddity. Most incorporated entities during the eighteenth century were religious institutions, municipalities, and government franchisees. In fact, the now ubiquitous business corporation did not become commonplace until the early nineteenth century, as government franchise corporations expanded to include incorporation of private businesses. To the framers, then, the concept of a corporate entity asserting community interests in natural resources on its own behalf would have been no more alien than the concept of a corporate entity asserting private business interests...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to demands to restructure and diversify their economies, many rural communities have welcomed the expanding phenomenon of second homes. However, {{while the second}} home owners bring new resources to the host communities, the literature also suggests that large second home populations in rural communities provide fertile ground {{for a number of}} economic, social and cultural conflicts and contestations. The present paper analyses the views of the local rural populations on the second home phenomenon, with particular attention to variation in these views, both within and between the rural communities (municipalities). The analysis uses material from the survey City, countryside, second homes 2008, which was conducted among a large-scale and representative sample of the population in Norwegian rural second home municipalities. The first section of the paper addresses the rural populations’ stance towards the second home phenomenon, both in general and as it unfolds in their own vicinity. Results show generally positive views on second home development; however, the analysis identifies a substantial minority which is negative to the second home expansion. Nevertheless, the second section shows that even those rurals who are negative towards further developments of second homes largely report harmonious social relationships with the second home population that is already present. Third, the paper presents and discusses a multivariate logistic regression model to analyse how different segments of the rural population vary in their views on second home phenomena. Here, results suggest differences at both micro and macro levels: the local rural elites, in particular those with <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> in the second home sector, are most positive towards further development. On the municipality level, resistance towards second homes is stronger in municipalities with a high density of second homes. Nevertheless, a high growth rate in the number of second homes, due to high investments, seems to increase local support. The Norwegian Research Counci...|$|R

Being a Sudeten German, Oskar Schindler, the hero of the film and the rescuer of hundreds of Jews from the Nazi destruction machinery, made Czechs aware not only or primarily of the atrocities of the Holocaust, but of several Czech-German troublespots of the past, including those related to the Sudeten German area that became an apple of discord between Czechoslovakia and Germany {{on the road to the}} Second World War, and from which millions of Germans were expelled at the end of and immediately after the war. For many Czechs with nationalist and communist sympathies, who dismissed the rescue mission as <b>directed</b> by <b>economic</b> <b>interests</b> and mythical in its character, Schindler represented the Sudeten German prototype of a "well-known Nazi hangman. " For other, more liberal-minded Czechs, the important Schindler legacy was one of hope of interethnic rapprochement and reconciliation. For a very few, Schindler´s List served to promote the "pure" memory of the Holocaust...|$|R

30|$|Although {{the concept}} of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) has been advocated for decades (Caroll, 1999; Jenkins, 2005) and is commonly deployed by corporations globally, agreement on how CSR should be defined and implemented remains a debatable issue in academic circles, business and society (Hemingway, 2002; Matten and Moon, 2008; Smith, 2011). CSR is the obligations of businessmen to pursue those policies, to make those decisions, or to follow those actions that are desirable {{in terms of the}} objectives and values of particular society (Bowen, 1953, p. 44). Similarly, CSR is the businessmen’s decisions and actions that go beyond the firm’s <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> and technical <b>interest</b> (Davis, 1960, p. 70). It is not only economic and legal obligations of corporations but also certain responsibilities to society which extend beyond these obligations (McGuire, 1963; Davis and Blomstrom, 1966). Fitch (1976) observed CSR as the serious attempt of corporation to solve social problems caused wholly or in part by it. Carroll (1979) blended the aforementioned definitions of CSR into a four-part definition: economic, legal, ethical and discretionary expectations that society has on organizations at a given point in time. Later on, Carroll (1991) revisited his four-part definition adding ethical and philanthropic functions.|$|R

Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, Turkey and South Korea {{have been}} actively participating in peace operations. Both states have many commonalities, such as substantial economic and military capabilities, considerable regional political influence, and strong relationships with the United States. Another similarity they share is in terms of their decisions to send troops to relatively risky operations in which they have no <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> or strategic <b>interests.</b> The aim of this thesis is to find out the decisive motivations of Turkey and South Korea, which could both be identified as “allied new middle powers,” for sending troops to the post-Cold War peace operations. Through analyzing the processes that led up to Turkey’s and South Korea’s decisions to participate in UNOSOM II, UNIFIL II, and ISAF, I have reached a conclusion that both states are highly motivated by future-oriented ideational considerations, namely, their intentions to become multi-regional or global actors in the new era. I have also discovered that indirect security concerns, the domestic factors, and potential economic benefits are less influential motivating factors for both Turkey and South Korea. Kim, Jin WooM.

It compares the individual-based bioethics in Western countries and the structure-based bioethics in the Chinese mainland, and discusses the lessons of structure-based bioethics for other countries. The histori-cal experience of health system reform in the Chinese mainland indicates that the health care system is welfare in nature, which is crucial; that the welfare health care system is the systematic foundation of medical professionalism; that there should not be <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> generated in doctor-patient re-lationship since the marketization of health financing may lead to not only the structure intension of doc-tor-patient relationship, but also a total collapse of the medical professionalism.

40|$|The {{story of}} the Dutch East India Company, Christiaan Huygens and the marine clock shows that {{in the seventeenth century}} Dutch Republic there was a {{tendency}} towards the formation of a modern partnership between business, science and technology. This emerging relationship was personified by Johannes Hudde (1628 - 1704) and Christiaan Huygens (1629 - 1695), men from entirely different walks of life except for their shared interest in science, especially mathematics. It was this shared interest in mathematics which brought them together and indirectly led to the marine clock research project. Hudde was a Director of the Dutch East India Company as well as a mathematician of international standing, whilst Huygens was both a brilliant theoretical scientist and extremely skilled innovator. Through his interest in mathematics, Hudde had come to know Huygens - he had corresponded with him and was broadly familiar with the work Huygens had been doing. So when Huygens, in 1682, returned to Holland from France, Hudde conceived the idea, which was entirely novel at the time, to enlist the support of the East India Company for one of Huygens' research projects, a project, of course, in which the Company had a <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest,</b> namely, the marine clock which it needed to find the longitude at sea.

40|$|The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its 1995 {{implementing}} agreement for highly migratory and {{straddling fish stocks}} (the UN Fish Stocks Agreement) articulate the need for conservation of high seas marine living resources and precautionary ecosystem-based management. Unfortunately, the underlying historical paradigm in the high seas is the "right to fish," without adhering to the broader conservation and environmental obligations on which those rights depend. The institutions that manage high seas living resources are largely limited to regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), comprised of state members with a <b>direct</b> <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> in the fishery and largely applying single species approaches to management. As a result, these RFMOs have largely {{failed to meet the}} larger mandates under the United Nations and even their own Conventions. In contrast, the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) mandates the conservation of the marine ecosystem. Given the new stressors of the twenty-first century and swiftness with which the global ocean is changing due to climate change and other human impacts, Best Practice Guidelines for RFMOs urge fisheries institutions to have mechanisms to respond to extreme environmental or other unpredictable events. Marine protected areas (MPAs) remain an effective tool for managing marine living resources and can help safeguard marine ecosystems in an uncertain future. Yet their application on the high seas has been limited thus far, with even CCAMLR struggling to adopt measures. Here we offer potential reforms that will enable RFMOs to better address the environmental and biodiversity directives of the UN agreements, and further explore avenues for reframing the "right to fish" in the twenty-first century...|$|E

50|$|As {{an aspect}} of the social {{contract}} between a state and its citizens, the state adopts a role of protector to the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. In public policy terms, this is the policy of parens patriae. Similarly, the state has a <b>direct</b> social and <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> in promoting trade, so it will define the forms of business enterprise that may operate within its territory, and lay down rules that will allow both the businesses and those that wish to contract with them a fair opportunity to gain value. This system worked well until social and commercial mobility increased. Now persons routinely trade and travel across state boundaries (both physically and electronically), so the need is to provide stability across state lines given that laws differ from one state to the next. Thus, once defined by the personal law, persons take their capacity with them like a passport whether or however they may travel. In this way, a person will not gain or lose capacity depending on the accident of the local laws, e.g. if A does not have capacity to marry her cousin under her personal law (a rule of consanguinity), she cannot evade that law by travelling to a state that does permit such a marriage (see nullity). In Saskatchewan Canada, an exception to this law allows married persons to become the common law spouse of other(s) prior to divorcing the first spouse. This law is not honored amongst other Canadian provinces.|$|R
