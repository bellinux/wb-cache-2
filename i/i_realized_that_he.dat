500|$|After Milk's {{vote for}} the mental health {{facility}} in White's district, however, White refused to speak with Milk and communicated with only one of Milk's aides. Other acquaintances remembered White as very intense. [...] "He was impulsive... He was an extremely competitive man, obsessively so... I think he could not take defeat," [...] San Francisco's assistant fire chief told reporters. White's first campaign manager quit {{in the middle of}} the campaign, and told a reporter that White was an egotist and it was clear that he was antigay, though he denied it in the press. White's associates and supporters described him [...] "as a man with a pugilistic temper and an impressive capacity for nurturing a grudge". The aide who had handled communications between White and Milk remembered, [...] "Talking to him, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw Harvey Milk and George Moscone as representing all that was wrong with the world".|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{choice of}} [...] "I'm the Greatest Star" [...] to {{audition}} {{for the role of}} Tony—the one song not from West Side Story—drew comment: Benigno ascribed it to Kurt's [...] "ability to make a talented ass of himself", while Slezak was of the opinion that Kurt was [...] "way too savvy, and way too hungry for the role" [...] for that kind of misstep. Despite these plot-related issues, both reviewers gave the performance an [...] "A", and Benigno noted both that [...] "he nails it" [...] and [...] "last half of the song is a singing clinic." [...] VanDerWerff was not fond of the reliance on [...] "gimmicky staging", though Futterman called it [...] "an impressive physical performance", Votta stated that [...] "Kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating" [...] and Flandez complimented his [...] "captivating high notes after high notes", and added, [...] "He's a star unicorn, and he knows it." [...] Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that Kurt [...] "was amazing singing Streisand, {{and for the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> really is as big a star as Rachel." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do like him, Elizabeth, {{for your}} sake. I suppose {{the trouble is}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is not good enough}} for you. I have known him all my life, and even as a little child he was never sincere. Possibly he has changed now. I hope so. And then again I know as well as you do that you are not in love with him." ...|$|R
60|$|A little mocking gleam {{crept into}} his eyes, and <b>I</b> {{instantly}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was looking upon me as a rather impertinent child.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the words}} of Madhusudan Kela at his {{experience}} in SIMSR,"We had a professor called Dr. R L Bhatia who taught us HR. He said whenever you face a grave problem, remember that your biggest asset are your people. And it is your {{ability to deal with}} people that determines how far you go in life. When I reflect back on my career of 25 years, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was absolutely right. At the end of the day, my people are my biggest strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had one and {{the same}} line of talk that he always used. I resented it. No wonder it was easy for him. [...] "Great mistake," [...] said Poppleton. [...] "Too soft. Look at this"--here he picked up a big stone and began {{pounding}} at the gate-post--"see how easily it chips! Smashes right off. Look at that, the whole corner knocks right off, see!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He drew in {{his breath}} audibly, yet still {{he did not}} speak. Either he was dull of {{comprehension}} or else he was astonished beyond words. I knew I was mad to goad him like that, but I could not help it. I grew hot with anger, and the more clearly <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had believed he could [...] "fix" [...] me with his dirty money the hotter I got.|$|E
60|$|Silently {{we entered}} {{the gate of the}} burial ground, and slowly {{approached}} the mound under which my mother's body rested, and as I studied the thin form and bending head of my intrepid sire, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in very truth treading the edge of his own grave. My eyes grew dim with tears and my throat ached with a sense of impending loss, and a pity for him which I could conceal only by looking away at the hills.|$|E
5000|$|Kent went to Gestapo {{headquarters}} to protest against their latest action in Marseilles: the stripping of {{males in the}} street {{to determine whether or}} not they were Jews (by circumcision). The Vice Consul rebuked the German commander and informed him that circumcision did not necessarily prove an individual's Jewishness. Kent said, [...] "When I saw the emptiness in the commander's eyes, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not understand what I am saying. And I said that I will accept to be examined by their doctors." [...] He told the Germans that Muslim men, as he was, were also circumcised.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} risk of your writing to St. John; but then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> {{answered}} and told you what I ought to have told you myself, {{it would make it}} worse, and I came back." ...|$|R
30|$|When I was in school, I had {{a classmate}} who {{invited me to}} her home. Nearby, {{there was a little}} house where (I later learned) her {{grandfather}} stayed and practiced meditation. I never saw him, but my classmate told <b>that</b> <b>he</b> meditated and recited mantras all the time, with only short pauses for taking food and drink. Now <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in an intensive retreat and was a dedicated Buddhist practitioner. At the time, I was very impressed by the thought of this old man sitting in meditation posture and continuously reciting mantras. It caused me to reflect, because, at the time, this was something extraordinary (Chodron 2016).|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing. Only, {{all at once}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a {{sensitive}} nature. I don't know why I shouldn't have realized it before. I had somehow taken {{it for granted that}} he was a self-conscious hermit, who lived in a squalid seclusion because he liked being wondered at. But he {{did not seem to be}} anything of the kind. I don't know whether he's a good cook, for he didn't ask me to eat anything; but I don't think he's a bad housekeeper." ...|$|E
60|$|The Ghost {{suddenly}} {{changed her}} course, keeping away, {{and it came}} to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible. Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was preparing to heave to, and dropped to the deck to be in readiness. We were now dead before the wind, the boat far away and abreast of us. I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift acceleration of speed. She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.|$|E
60|$|I {{watched him}} for a long time, wondering, why it was that such a doglike animal was not a better swimmer. As he neared me <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{weakening}} rapidly. I had gathered a handful of stones to be ready for his assault when he landed, but in a moment I let them fall from my hands. It was evident that the brute either was no swimmer or else was severely injured, for by now he was making practically no headway. Indeed, it was with quite apparent difficulty that he kept his nose above the surface of the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "I little {{expected}} to find you at large {{in the streets of}} this town," [...] Seth said in what he meant to be a jeering tone, but, with all my senses on the alert because of the imminence of the danger, I noticed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looked uneasily out of the tail of his eye as if having it in mind to give me the slip, and this, as you may suppose, heartened me, although even while I stood gazing at him did <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was simply casting about in his mind for some means whereby he might take advantage of thus meeting with me.|$|R
60|$|I {{was near}} to crying aloud with joy when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> once <b>he</b> set out as Darius predicted, nothing could save him from our clutches, {{therefore}} I literally {{held my breath}} as he took his seat in the canoe and pushed off.|$|R
5000|$|Engineer Chuck Britz said of Murry: [...] "I {{was one of}} the {{few people}} who liked Murry. I always did. I admired him for the way he got the kids mad at him that made them also {{conscious}} of what they were trying to achieve. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> maybe <b>he</b> did it the wrong way, but at the same time, he did make them work as a team which was the way it should be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} he did. Still, you saw what the little man has to expect if he makes a bid. On {{thinking}} it over, {{it seems to me}} that Merril trusted to my broker. He figured I'd back down once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew my game and was a match for me. There are big men like him who live by bluff, and everybody makes way for them, but they're apt to show themselves very much the same as other people when you face them resolutely. It's just like putting a pin in a bubble." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be said, and a poor man can {{put up with a}} good deal for twenty pounds a day, but I felt none the less that Lord Linchmere was acting rather scurvily towards me. He wished to convert me into a passive tool, like the {{blackthorn}} in his hand. With his sensitive disposition I could imagine, however, that scandal would be abhorrent to him, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not take me into his confidence until no other course was open to him. I must trust to my own eyes and ears to solve the mystery, but I had every confidence that I should not trust to them in vain.|$|E
60|$|I thought Mr. Jason smiled. By {{this time}} I had grown {{accustomed}} to the darkness, the face and figure {{of the man in}} the bed had become discernible. Power, I remember thinking, chooses odd houses for itself. Here was no overbearing, full-blooded ward ruffian brimming with vitality, but a thin, sallow little man in a cotton night-shirt, with iron-grey hair and a wiry moustache; he might have been an overworked clerk behind a dry-goods counter; and yet somehow, now that I had talked to him, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never could have been. Those extraordinary eyes of his, when they were functioning, marked his individuality as unique. It were almost too dramatic to say that he required darkness to make his effect, but so it seemed. I should never forget him. He had in truth been well named the Spider.|$|E
60|$|But just at {{the moment}} of his coming I didn't care how he had come or who had brought him. <b>I</b> just <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was there and that was enough. Sara came in behind him. Walter's wet arms were about me and I was {{standing}} there with my thin-slippered feet in a little pool of water that dripped from his umbrella. But Sara never said a word about colds and dampness. She just smiled, went on into the sitting-room, and shut the door. Sara understood.|$|R
50|$|I {{kept looking}} at the part and {{wondered}} how I could crack it, because {{he was such a}} straitlaced character. And then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> thought he was trendy and avant-garde, that added a whole new swing to it. I see him as quite the star of his theological college, probably quite daring with his Turkish cigarettes. And I imagine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> even makes the occasional sexual reference in his conversation after a couple of glasses of sherry. But confronted with the real McCoy, in the form of Elle Macpherson without her clothes, he's hopeless.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{had to help}} him, {{for almost}} on the instant he sank down, and I had to guide him to the rugs spread on the ground. In a few seconds {{he was in a}} deep sleep. As I stood looking at him, till <b>I</b> had <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> vas really asleep, I could not help marvelling at the bounty of Nature that could uphold even such a man as this to the last moment of work to be done, and then allow so swift a {{collapse}} when all was over, and he could rest peacefully.|$|R
60|$|Better, I should say, {{take the}} rapido which leaves Madrid {{three times a}} week at nine-thirty in the morning, than the night express which leaves as often at the same hour in the evening. Since there are now such good day trains on the chief Spanish lines, it is flying in the face of Providence not to go by them; they might be {{suddenly}} taken off; besides, they have excellent restaurant-cars, and there is, moreover, always the fascinating and often the memorable landscape which they pass through. By no fault of ours that I can remember, our train was rather crowded; that is, four or five out of the eight places in our corridor compartment were taken, and we were afraid at every stop that more people would get in, though I do not know that it was our anxieties kept them out. For the matter of that, I do not know why I employed an interpreter at Madrid to get my ticket stamped at the ticket-office; it required merely the presentation of the ticket at the window; but the interpreter seemed to wish it and it enabled him to practise his English with me, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must live. In a peseta's worth of gratitude he followed us to our carriage, and he did not molest the mozo in putting our bags into the racks, though he hovered about the door till the train started; and it just now occurs to me that he may have thought a peseta was not a sufficient return for his gratitude; he had rendered us no service.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} sleep," [...] he wrote, [...] "on {{account of this}} man and his talk and the streak of hatred in his talk. He distressed me not because he seemed exceptional, but because he seemed ordinary. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was more human than I was, and that only killing and killing {{could come out of}} such humanity. I thought of the great ugly guns I had seen, and of the still greater guns he had talked about, and how gloatingly he thought of the {{destruction}} they could do. I felt as I used to feel about that infernal stallion that had killed a man with its teeth and feet, a despairing fear, a sense of monstrosity in life. And this creature who had so disturbed me was only a beastly snuffy little man in an ill-fitting frock-coat, who laid his knife and fork by their tips {{on the edge of his}} plate, and picked his teeth with gusto and breathed into my face as he talked to me. The commonest of representative men. I went about that Westphalian country after that, with the conviction that headless, soulless, blood-drinking metal monsters were breeding all about me. I felt that science was producing a poisonous swarm, a nest of black dragons. They were crouching here and away there in France and England, they were crouching like beasts that bide their time, mewed up in forts, kennelled in arsenals, hooded in tarpaulins as hawks are hooded.... And I had never thought very much about them before, and there they were, waiting until some human fool like that frock-coated thing of spite, and fools like him multiplied by a million, saw fit to call them out to action. Just out of hatred and nationalism and faction...." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{suddenly}} I {{was aware}} of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not {{from the direction of}} Baker Street, but {{from the back of the}} very house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps crept down the passage--steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back against the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no idea of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to the level of this opening, the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars, and his features were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-lock. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his foresight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman's back, and hurled him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat, but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver, and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.|$|E
5000|$|Before Gao {{moved to}} his new position, he confessed to Wang <b>that</b> <b>he</b> underestimated Sanduo and said: [...] "...he (Sanduo) takes {{everything}} as a life saver, things that everybody else ignores and things that are as minuscule as grass. He is now grown up. <b>I</b> now <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> whatever <b>he</b> grasped wasn't grass, but a tree {{as high as the}} sky." [...] He proposed to take Sanduo with him, but Wang did not approve.|$|R
25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and <b>I</b> sort of <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{certainly}} lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|R
50|$|Gossard on the song:We wrote it, {{we played}} it and Ed sang it, {{which is another}} thing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does. I'd never seen anyone engage with song writing the same way. Here's the song, let me play it for you. It goes like this. Okay, theres a change here, let's do it and he would sing it. I'd hear the melodies and I'd think, okay, he's gonna write words or {{whatever}} and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually had written the words right there. I couldn't understand how somebody could do that. Since then I've {{met a lot of}} people that can do it so it was an eye opener but he does it better than anyone I've ever seen do it.|$|R
50|$|Saint-Saëns later wrote: A young {{relative}} of mine {{had married a}} charming young man who wrote verse on the side. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was gifted and had in fact real talent. I asked him {{to work with me}} on an oratorio on a biblical subject. 'An oratorio!', he said, 'no, let's make it an opera!', and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with Act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, {{ten years}} after the letter was sent, Gorbachev regretted his {{ignoring}} Khomeini's letter which was sent three years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In his interview with the IRIB News Agency in Moscow in 1999, on the anniversary of Khomeini's death, Gorbachev said: [...] "I think Imam Khomeini’s message addressed all the ages throughout history." [...] "When I received this message, I felt the person who wrote it was thoughtful and cared about the situation of the world. By studying the letter, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was someone who was worried about the world and wanted me to understand more about the Islamic revolution," [...] he added.|$|E
5000|$|Bert, though {{kind and}} intelligent, is also grumpy, boring, and easily frustrated. His catchphrase is [...] "Yes, I do mind!" [...] He enjoys {{activities}} such as paper clip and bottle cap collecting, cooking oatmeal and watching pigeons. Producer Arlene Sherman has called Bert [...] "everyone's idea of a blind date". [...] In one sketch, Bert reads a book called Boring Stories and chuckles, [...] "Wow! These boring stories are really exciting!" [...] In the book Sesame Street Unpaved, Frank Oz says, [...] "I was never really happy with Bert's character until about a year in, when <b>I</b> <b>realized...</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a very boring character, and I'd use that weakness as a strength for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit I was talking about him, but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when <b>I</b> started to <b>realize</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|R
