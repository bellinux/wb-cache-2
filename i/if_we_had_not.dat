It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
500|$|The Poles' gift, {{to their}} western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five {{weeks before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, came not a moment too soon. [...] Former Bletchley Park mathematician-cryptologist Gordon Welchman has written: [...] "Ultra would never have gotten off the ground <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> learned from the Poles, {{in the nick of}} time, the details both of the German military... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." [...] Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been [...] "of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously." [...] Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this [...] "decisive contribution to the Allied war effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Intelligence {{gained from}} solving {{high-level}} German ciphers—intelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that [...] "it {{is widely believed}} that Ultra saved the world {{at least two years}} of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning." [...] The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having [...] "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". [...] The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: [...] "Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Iraqis, Syrians {{and analysts}} {{who study the}} group, almost all of ISIL's leaders—including the members of its {{military}} and security committees {{and the majority of}} its emirs and princes—are former Iraqi military and intelligence officers, specifically former members of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath government who lost their jobs and pensions in the de-Ba'athification process after that regime was overthrown. The former Chief Strategist in the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the US State Department, David Kilcullen, has said that [...] "There undeniably would be no Isis <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> invaded Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{managing}} of the Luftwaffe was Göring; Hitler believed the Luftwaffe was [...] "the most effective strategic weapon", and in reply to repeated requests from the Kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted, [...] "We {{should never have been}} able to hold our own in this war <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> had an undivided Luftwaffe." [...] Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in Göring a jealous and damaging defence of his [...] "empire" [...] while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the Luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and Göring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over. In 1940 and 1941, Göring's refusal to co-operate with the Kriegsmarine denied the entire Wehrmacht military forces of the Reich the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British Empire.|$|E
