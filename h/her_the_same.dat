500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his landlord for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying to prevent them from entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as she refers to having had Mulder ask <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> question over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they all die.|$|E

500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E
