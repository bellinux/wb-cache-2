This study {{involved}} (a) {{the development and}} testing of a solution turbidity fractionation analyser (TFA) and (b) the investigation of possible molecular weight effects on solution crystallisation. To investigate the latter highly isotactic polypropylene was polymerised with a C 2 symmetric metallocene catalyst. Blends were made of these <b>homopolymers.</b> The <b>homopolymers</b> {{as well as the}} blends were fractionated by means of temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF). The fractionated and unfractionated <b>homopolymers</b> as well as the fractionated blends were characterised by 13 C NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The TFA was successfully developed and helped in explaining the shifting of solution crystallisation temperature that was seen when blending of the <b>homopolymers</b> occurred. This was done performing analyses on the machine of blends of the <b>homopolymers.</b> Fractions, of the <b>homopolymers</b> and blends, obtained from TREF were also done. Subsequent runs of blends made from the fractions obtained from TREF were also done. In the end it was shown that the shift of the solution crystallisation temperature is either due to the tacticity or the molecular weight depending on the sample...|$|R

25|$|Poly(styrene), for example, is {{composed}} only of styrene monomer residues, {{and is therefore}} classified as a <b>homopolymer.</b> Ethylene-vinyl acetate, on the other hand, contains more than one variety of repeat unit and is thus a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed {{of a variety of}} different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{copolymers}} possess two regularly alternating monomer residues: n (structure 2 at right). An {{example is}} the equimolar copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride formed by free-radical chain-growth polymerization. A step-growth copolymer such as Nylon 66 {{can also be considered}} a strictly alternating copolymer of diamine and diacid residues, but is often described as a <b>homopolymer</b> with the dimeric residue of one amine and one acid as a repeat unit.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach, ion semiconductor sequencing, {{is based}} on standard DNA replication chemistry. This technology measures {{the release of a}} hydrogen ion each time a base is incorporated. A microwell containing template DNA is flooded with a single nucleotide, if the nucleotide is complementary to the template strand it will be incorporated and a hydrogen ion will be released. This release triggers an ISFET ion sensor. If a <b>homopolymer</b> is present in the template sequence multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single flood cycle, and the detected electrical signal will be proportionally higher.|$|E
30|$|Ashiuchi and Misono {{previously}} {{suggested that}} PGA production may be achieved using Gram-positive Bacilli such as B. anthracis and the extremely halophilic archaeon Natrialba aegyptiaca. These microbes produce PGA polymers of 10 {{to more than}} 1000  kDa (kilo Dalton) with specific d/l-ratios (Ashiuchi and Misono 2002). Specifically, d-PGA <b>homopolymers</b> comprise only d-glutamate, whereas l-PGA <b>homopolymers</b> comprise only l-glutamate, and dl-PGA copolymers contain both enantiomers of glutamate. Among these, <b>homopolymers</b> have strong resistance to phagocytosis (Makino et al. 1989) and can act as protein stabilizers (Yamasaki et al. 2010).|$|R

25|$|The {{first steps}} of RNA-seq also include similar image processing, however, {{conversion}} of images to sequence data is typically handled automatically by the instrument software. The Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis method {{results in a}} random or ordered array of clusters distributed {{over the surface of}} a flow cell. The flow cell is imaged up to four times during each sequencing cycle, with tens to hundreds of cycles in total. Flow cell clusters are analogous to microarray spots and must be correctly identified during {{the early stages of the}} sequencing process. In Roche’s pyrosequencing method, the intensity of emitted light determines the number of consecutive nucleotides in a <b>homopolymer</b> repeat. There are many variants on these methods, each with a different error profile for the resulting data.|$|E
25|$|Polysialic acid (PSA) is a {{relatively}} new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for artificial nerve conduits. It is a <b>homopolymer</b> of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues and a dynamically regulated posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Recent studies have demonstrated that polysialylated NCAM (polySia-NCAM) promotes regeneration in the motor system. PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for induced degradation by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved in steering processes like neuritogenesis, axonal path finding, and neuroblast migration. Animals with PSA genetically knocked out express a lethal phenotype, which has unsuccessful path finding; nerves connecting the two brain hemispheres were aberrant or missing. Thus PSA is vital for proper nervous system development.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 We {{study the}} micro- and macrophase {{behavior}} of symmetric AB-diblock copolymers in binary and ternary blends with corresponding <b>homopolymers</b> in mean field theory and for weak to intermediate segregation. We employ the standard Gaussian chain model and numerically solve the mean field equation in Fourier space. Besides homogeneous phases, {{we consider the}} following ordered morphologies: sheetlike lamellae, hexagonally arranged cylinders, and spheres on a body-centered-cubic lattice. We consider only symmetric diblocks, but vary the chain length of the <b>homopolymers</b> from 0. 1 to 1. 5 {{the length of the}} copolymer. For the ternary systems, we produce several constant temperature cuts through the Gibbs phase prism. For the binary system, we also study the temperature dependence of the phase diagram. For the symmetric system, in which both <b>homopolymers</b> are of equal length with the diblock, we consider the temperature dependence at all compositions of the ternary mixture. We find the following general trends: <b>homopolymers,</b> longer than the copolymer are expelled from the microstructure and phase separate. <b>Homopolymers</b> comparable to or shorter than the diblock, swell the microstructure, whereas very short <b>homopolymers</b> tend to destroy any ordered phase. For a narrow region in the weak to intermediate segregation regime, <b>homopolymers</b> comparable in length to the diblock can swell the microstructure indefinitely, leading to a complete unbinding of the ordered phase. The transition from bound to unbound as temperature is varied can be either continuous or first-order. In the latter case, the expected preunbinding line is found as a coexistence region between two different ordered phases with the same symmetry, but of different periodicity. For the symmetric system, in which all chains are of equal length, we find a multicritical Lifshitz point within mean field theory. All these results can be understood in terms of simple brush- and stretching arguments. A comprehensive overview over the statistical theory of flexible chain molecules has been provided, as well as a review over previous experimental and theoretical investigations of self-assembly in block copolymers systems...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{domain of}} Tat is {{required}} for trans-activation of viral gene expression. We have performed scanning peptide studies to demonstrate that only this domain is capable of binding to the TAR RNA stem-loop. Strikingly, the basic domain of the other human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting factor, Rev, but no other region, is also capable of binding to TAR. Peptide derivatives of Tat do not require the highly conserved glutamine residue at position 54 for TAR binding, since it may be substituted or deleted. In addition, the two lysine residues may be replaced by arginines. Analysis of binding and trans-activation demonstrated that <b>homopolymers</b> of arginine can completely substitute for the basic domain. Such <b>homopolymers</b> have high affinity for wild-type TAR RNA and lower affinity for mutant TAR. <b>Homopolymers</b> of six to nine arginines substituting for the basic domain of Tat enable full trans-activation in vivo. <b>Homopolymers</b> of at least seven arginines are required for detectable in vitro complex formation, although approximately 30 % trans-activation is achieved with a mutant Tat containing only five arginines...|$|R
