50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s and in 2008, there were {{shortages}} of haematoxylin due to interruptions in its extraction from logwood. The {{price of the}} compound increased, affecting the cost of diagnostic histopathology, and prompted a search for alternative nuclear stains. Before {{the use of any}} alternatives became firmly established, haematoxylin returned to the market, though at a higher price, and resumed its place in histopathology. Several synthetic dyes have been recommended as replacements, notably celestine blue (CI 51050), <b>gallocyanine</b> (CI 51030), gallein (CI 45445) and eriochrome cyanine R (also called chromoxane cyanine R and solochrome cyanine (CI 43820). All four have Fe(III) as the mordant. Another alternative is the aluminium complex of oxidized brazilin, which differs from haematoxylin by only one hydroxyl group.|$|E
40|$|The cornu ammonis 1 {{region of}} the {{hippocampus}} (CA 1) sector of hippocampus is vulnerable to both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) -type neurofibrillary degeneration and anoxia–ischemia. The objective {{of this article is}} to compare number and size of neurons in CA 1 in AD versus ischemic vascular dementia. Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate the number and volume of neurons in 28 autopsy-derived brain samples. For each case, the entire hippocampus from one cerebral hemisphere was sliced into 5 mm slabs (5 – 7 slabs/case), cut into 50 �m sections, and stained with <b>gallocyanine.</b> Using the optical dissector, we systematically sampled the number and size of neurons throughout the extent of CA 1 and CA 2. The total number of neurons was significantly less in AD compared with ischemic vascular dementia (p < 0. 02), but there was no significant difference in neuron size. The greatest loss of neurons was observed in two cases with combined AD and hippocampal sclerosis. Regardless of causative diagnosis, the number of CA 1 neurons correlates with magnetic resonance imaging–derived hippocampal volume (r � 0. 72; p < 0. 001) and memory score (r � 0. 62; p < 0. 01). We conclude that although CA 1 neuron loss is more consistently observed in AD than ischemic vascular dementia, severity of loss shows the expected correlation with structure and function across causative subtype. Reductions in magnetic resonance imaging–derived hippocampal volume reflect loss, rather than shrinkage, of CA 1 neurons.

40|$|Background: Tramadol is a {{centrally}} acting synthetic analgesic {{agent with}} opioid activity. Tramadol {{is used to}} treat moderate to severe pain. The entorhinal cortex has initially attracted attention because of its strong reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation and its involvement in certain brain disorders. Aim of work: The present {{study was designed to}} assess the deleterious effects of tramadol on the entorhinal cortex of the adult male albino rats. Materials and methods: The study was carried out on 40 adult male rats. The rats were divided equally into two groups: control group, received 1  ml normal saline 0. 9 % intraperitoneally for 4  weeks. Treated group received 50  mg/kg/day of tramadol intraperitoneally for 4  weeks. All animals were anaesthetized by ether inhalation and perfused by normal saline. The brains were extracted from the skulls. For light microscopy, the brains of 10 animals in each group were processed for paraffin sections and stained by <b>Gallocyanine</b> stain. For electron microscopy, the entorhinal cortex was dissected in 10 brains of each group and processed. Semithin sections were prepared and stained with toluidine blue. Morphometric and statistical studies were performed. Results: By light microscopy, the treated groups showed neuronal cells disorganization. Apoptotic cells were detected. In addition, diffuse chromatolysis of nuclear chromatin, absence of nucleoli, multinuclear cells, intercellular edema and a congested blood capillary were noticed. By electron microscopy, the treated groups of both lateral and medial entorhinal areas showed granular and pyramidal apoptotic cells. The morphometric and statistical studies showed significant increase of apoptotic index % in treated group as compared with control group. Conclusion: Tramadol had degenerative effects on both lateral and medial entorhinal areas. Light as well as electron microscopic examination of entorhinal areas came to prove these effects. Tramadol abuse should be avoided without medical description due to its toxic effects...|$|E

40|$|Developing a {{functional}} blood substitute {{as an alternative}} to donated blood for clinical use is believed to relieve present and future blood shortages, and to reduce the risks of infection and blood type mismatching. Hemoglobin vesicle (HbV) encapsulates a purified and concentrated human-derived Hb solution in a phospholipid vesicle (liposome). The in vivo safety and efficacy of HbV as a transfusion alternative have been clarified. Auto-oxidation of ferrous Hb in HbV gradually increases the level of ferric methemoglobin (metHb) and impairs the oxygen transport capabilities. The extension of the functional half-life of HbV has recently been proposed using an electron mediator, methylene blue (MB), which acts as a shuttle between red blood cells (RBC) and HbV. MB transfers electron energies of NAD(P) H, produced by RBC glycolysis, to metHb in HbV. Work presented here focuses on screening of 15 potential electron mediators, with appropriate redox potential and water solubility, for electron transfer from RBC to HbV. The results are assessed with regard to the chemical properties of the candidates. The compounds examined in this study were dimethyl methylene blue (DMB), methylene green, azure A, azure B, azure C, toluidine blue (TDB), thionin acetate, phenazine methosulfate, brilliant cresyl blue, cresyl violet, <b>gallocyanine,</b> toluylene blue, indigo carmine, indigotetrasulfonate, and MB. Six candidates were found to be unsuitable because of their insufficient diffusion across membranes, or overly high or nonexistent reactivity with relevant biomolecules. However, 9 displayed favorable metHb reduction. Among the suitable candidates, phenothiazines DMB and TDB exhibited effectiveness like MB did. In comparison to MB, they showed faster reduction by electron-donating NAD(P) H, coupled with showing a lower rate of reoxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen. Ascertaining the best electron mediator can provide a pathway for extending the lifetime and efficiency of potential blood substitutes...|$|E
40|$|An {{organometallic}} 4 d {{transition metal}} complex [Cp*RhCl 2] 2, together with commercially available dyes, {{was used to}} construct indicator displacement assays (IDAs) {{for the detection of}} peptides, amino acids, and nucleotides. The combination of the Cp*Rh complex with the dye azophloxine was found to form a chemosensing ensemble for the sequence-selective detection of histidine- and methionine-containing peptides in water at neutral pH. A strong interaction of the rhodium complex with peptides bearing histidine or methionine residue in the position 1 or 2 allowed to detect these peptides down to a concentration of 0. 3 µM. The same organometallic complex and three commercially available dyes were employed to compose an array of IDA chemosensors for the detection of natural amino acids. We found that the variation of the pH can effectively be used to modulate the selectivity of an IDA sensor. An excellent discrimination of 20 amino acids was achieved. The combination of [Cp*RhCl 2] 2 with the dyes <b>gallocyanine,</b> evans blue, and mordant yellow 10 forms a multicomponent indicator displacement assay (MIDA), which can be used to sense low millimolar concentrations of nucleotides and the pyrophosphate anion in buffered aqueous solution. Moreover, the MIDA allows to simultaneously determine the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate and pyrophosphate/cyclic adenosine monophosphate with a single UV-Vis measurement. In the second part of our work we investigated whether dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) can be used for sensing purposes. We found that the dyes arsenazo I, methylcalcein blue, and glycine cresol red, in combination with the metal salts CuCl 2 and NiCl 2, form a DCL of differently colored metal-dye complexes. The addition of an analyte able to interact with a member(s) of such a library, results in a re-equilibraion easily detectable by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Using dipeptides as analytes we demonstrated that this way of sensing is very effective – even closely related peptides such as regio- (Ala-Phe vs. Phe-Ala) and stereo- (Phe-Ala vs. D-Phe-Ala) isomers can easily be discriminated. Additionally, we found that the identity of the best sensor depends on the problem to be addressed...|$|E
