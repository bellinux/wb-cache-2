It investigates the effect of clay stabilization and <b>hemp</b> to <b>binder</b> ratio on mechanical performances. All composites have ductile behavior. Composites with highest <b>hemp</b> to <b>binder</b> ratio show steadily increasing strength with deformation. Hemp stabilized clay composites have better mechanical properties than hemp clay composites. Mechanical properties strongly depend on the <b>hemp</b> to <b>binder</b> ratio. The tensile strength ranges from 0. 021 to 0. 059 MPa. The compressive strength ranges from 0. 39 to 0. 68 MPa. The mechanical performance of developed composites meets the requirements of the intended use. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Hemp</b> and <b>binder</b> (e. g. Lime) is an {{insulating}} wall matrix formed around a timber frame. It has multiple environmental benefits including sequestering carbon dioxide {{from the atmosphere}} into a building‟s walls and is thus {{of interest in the}} current climate situation. However the thermal performance of the matrix when evaluated using the steady state thermal conductivity (i. e. rate of heat transfer) is not as effective for the same thickness as other insulations. The world however is dynamic and in the Haverhill Housing Project monitored by the Building Research Establishment (UK) two hemp and lime houses, despite having a worse steady state thermal performance on paper, significantly outperformed comparative standard houses (BRE 2002, 2003). The reasons for this unexpected performance are not clarified although the heat storage capacity and the moisture handling ability of the matrix are possibilities. <b>Hemp</b> and <b>binder</b> matrix has been shown to have considerable moisture handling and heat storage capabilities but how or whether these improve thermal performance is not clear. All the tests reported so far have been on the same binder yet there are many potential binders and each will change the properties of the matrix and each has a different environmental legacy. To further clarify the in-building performance and to compare a range of binders, 5 different binder test wall sections in the Welsh Institute of Sustainable Education building at the Centre of Alternative Technology are being extensively monitored for heat flux, temperature and moisture movements. This paper is an initial report of this experiment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to the low}} {{density and}} high {{porosity}} of the hemp hurds, the combination of <b>hemp</b> and <b>binder</b> creates a building material with good thermal and acoustic insulation properties. Today hemp hurds {{can be used in}} high-quality products such as hemp concrete, fibre board and composites. In this paper, the attention is given {{to the study of the}} properties of lightweight composites based on modified hemp hurds as filler and MgO-cement as binder. The cohesion of the filler and of the binder is an important factor in the development of mechanical properties. The impact of ultrasonic treatment of hemp hurds and its cooking in water for 1 h on the physical and mechanical properties (compressive strength, density, water absorbability, thermal conductivity) of the composites hardened in indoor condition was studied. The observation is also focused on the influence of the hemp hurds length. The durability of produced composites was studied under different conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} new hybrid composite materials using granulated cork, a by-product of cork industry, cellulose pulp, from recycling of paper residues, and <b>hemp</b> fibres. The <b>binder</b> used is either cellulose pulp or lime-pozzolan mixture. Such materials may be used as composite boards and mortars for non structural elements of construction, such as dry walls and ceiling or floor levelling and filling. The possibility of using these composites in conjugation with light structural supports has been studied.

40|$|International audienceThe hemp {{concrete}} {{is considered}} as an eco-material {{due to its}} environmental assets. Its constituents are mainly the <b>hemp</b> particles, <b>binder</b> and water to which admixtures are added eventually. The quality of hemp particles is very sensitive {{to the nature of}} soil where it is produced and also to its transformation process, which results in properties variability of hemp particles. And this may be a barrier to development of hemp concrete industry. The herein study aims to evaluate scientifically the impact of this variability on hemp concrete performances. This study is carried out through two main steps: (1) predicting the impact of hemp particles on the hemp concrete, (2) hemp concrete characterization. In the first step, a multicriteria analysis (particle size distributions, etc.) highlights the significant variability of the hemp particles and allowed to classify them into three groups. In the second step, the tests carried out on hemp concrete resulted in low, medium and high mechanical performances as predicted. A factor close to 10 is observed between the minimum and maximum compressive strengths. However, the density and the thermal conductivity are of low variability. The performed analysis show that the interaction between the hemp particles and the binder is likely to contribute to the mechanical response...|$|R
40|$|The use of vegetal concretes, such as hemp concrete, {{is growing}} for {{building}} insulation. They are constituted by vegetal aggregates {{embedded in a}} mineral <b>binder.</b> <b>Hemp</b> concretes are multifunctional materials: they have interesting thermal and acoustical performances and their hygrothermal behavior enables a natural moisture regulation.

It is shown that this aging induces modifications of the porosity of the materials and of their skeleton density. However, these evolutions of microstructure are not sufficient to lead to modifications of thermal and acoustical performances. This work has also shown that mold growth occurs when the relative humidity is high (98 % RH) and when the pH of the binder has decreased due to its carbonation reaction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} effect of the kind of binder on thermal, hygric and {{mechanical}} properties of <b>hemp</b> composites. Three <b>binders</b> are considered: a formulated hydraulic lime based binder, a prompt cement based binder and a peculiar bio-polymer: the Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA). The binder is coupled with hemp shiv to produce biocomposite. For each kind of binder, the specific manufacturing method is presented and discussed. The thermal properties of produced biocomposite are measured with a hot disk method at 23 °C, 50 %RH. The hygric characterization is based on the measurement of Moisture Buffer Value at 23 °C. The mechanical behavior of composite under compression is analyzed. Thermal conductivities range from 0. 08 to 0. 16 W/(m. K), this allows to use these composites without added insulation layer. Following the classification given in the Nordtest report, the studied materials are very good or excellent hygric regulator. Performances are slightly higher with mineral binders. However, the compressive strength obtained with PLA binder are much higher than the ones with mineral binders...|$|R
40|$|Hemp-lime is a {{sustainable}} low-carbon composite building material that combines renewably sourced hemp shiv (a coproduct of hemp fibre crop production) with formulated lime-based binders. To date, its primary use {{has been to}} form solid external walls in timber-framed buildings. This paper reports on the testing of 54 hemp-lime cylinders to compare their strength and stiffness properties at three different densities and at different ages up to 180 days. Three different and widely used formulated lime binders were studied. Phenolphthalein staining was used to map development of the carbonation front across specimen cross-sections. The strength and stiffness properties of the hemp-lime are comparable with other rigid insulation materials such as woodfibre board. The strength of hemp-lime increases with mix density and age. However, the strength of hemp-lime is {{not directly related to}} the individual strength of the binder, but rather is a function of complex and dynamic interactions between the <b>hemp</b> and the <b>binder</b> matrix, as well as the density and the percentage of wet binder mix at fabrication...|$|R

The samples are submitted to wetting/drying cycles and their performances are analyzed periodically. In this article, the properties of the materials after 75 days of ageing are reported. It is shown that this period is too short to observe any significant variation of the properties of the hemp concretes, except for their porosity. The biological ageing of the materials is investigated too.

40|$|In this paper, water {{sorption}} {{behavior of}} 28 days hardened composites based on hemp hurds and inorganic binder was studied. Two kinds of absorption tests on dried cube specimens in deionized water bath at laboratory temperature were performed. Short-term (after one hour water immersion) and long-term (up to 180 days) water absorption tests {{were carried out}} to study their durability. Short-term water sorption behavior of original hemp hurds composites depends on mean particle length of <b>hemp</b> and on <b>binder</b> nature. The comparative study of long-term water sorption behavior of composites reinforced with original and chemically modified hemp hurds in three reagents confirmed that surface treatment of filler influences sorption process. Based on evaluation of sorption curves using a model for composites based on natural fibers, diffusion of water molecules in composite reinforced with original and chemically modified hemp hurds is anomalous {{in terms of the}} Fickian behavior. The most significant decrease in hydrophility of hemp hurds was found in case of hemp hurds modified by NaOH and it relates to change in the chemical composition of hemp hurds, especially to a decrease in average degree of cellulose polymerization as well as hemicellulose content...|$|R
40|$|Hemp {{concrete}} is {{a sustainable}} material made of lime <b>binder,</b> <b>hemp</b> and water. This non-bearing material {{is used for}} building envelope. This study deals with hydric characteristics like moisture diffusivity which is calculated {{on the one hand}} with an experimental method {{and on the other hand}} with a numerical method based on the fit of kinetics. The experimental investigations are based on water vapour sorption and water vapour permeability measurements. Water vapour sorption measurements are carried out according to a discontinuous method on the whole range of relative humidities (from 0 to 97 %). Water content is measured after stabilization and the sorption isotherm is fitted with GAB model [1]. The water vapour permeability is measured from the cup method. Relative humidities are the same as those used for sorption test. Once steady state is reached, the water vapour permeability is calculated with Fick's Law. Water vapour permeability increases with water content and this variation is modeled with a power law [2]. Then the moisture diffusivity is calculated from derivative of the GAB model and from the power law of the permeability. The numerical investigation work out the diffusivity from the moisture transfer equation and from kinetic of sorption. Cylindrical samples of sorption test are made watertight in the upper and lower part in order to ensure the water diffusion occurs in one plane. The fit of the moisture transfer equation on experimental kinetic leads to the diffusivity. Numerical investigation is in good agreement with experimental one. So moisture diffusivity can be achieved with sorption test or transitional state on permeability test...|$|R
