25|$|By 1943, the IPSFC {{had found}} 37 {{obstructions}} that were impeding the salmon run along Hells Gate. After receiving an official proposal from the IPSFC that included both biological and engineering data, both the Canadian and US governments approved {{a plan to}} construct a set of fishways at Hells Gate in 1944. In 1946, construction of the fishways on both banks was completed, offering easy passage for salmon at gauge levels between 23 and 54 feet. However, problems still remained at certain water levels. At high levels of 50–65 feet, {{and low levels of}} 11–17 feet, salmon encountered difficulty migrating upstream. In response, two high-level fishways were built beginning with one on the right bank in 1947 that operated between 54 and 70 feet as well as a <b>fishway</b> on the left bank that operated at the same levels and was completed in 1951. Yet some issues remained, and the <b>fishway</b> on the left bank was extended to operate at levels up to 92 gauge in 1965. The last addition was the construction of sloping baffles on the left bank in 1966 that aided salmon passage below gauge 24.|$|E
25|$|Written {{reports of}} rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of {{branches}} {{were used to}} create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a <b>fishway</b> to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill. In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam. As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading {{to the need for}} effective fish by-passes.|$|E
25|$|The dam poses an impassable {{barrier to}} {{migrating}} salmonids which {{is significant because}} the San Francisquito Creek watershed hosts the most viable remaining native steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) population in the South San Francisco Bay. Although anadromous or seagoing steelhead trout still spawn below Searsville Dam, {{they can no longer}} run above Searsville Dam to spawn. Corte Madera Creek was described as an historic steelhead trout spawning stream by Skinner in 1962. However stream resident coastal rainbow trout, run up from Searsville Reservoir to spawn in upper Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries, enabling this native fish to survive above the dam as well. A May 2002 steelhead trout migration study reported Searsville Dam as the only complete barrier to migration on mainstem San Francisquito Creek (construction of a <b>fishway</b> in 1976 resolved passage at the Lake Lagunita diversion dam 2.5 miles below Searsville Dam), and that elimination of the Searsville dam could restore ten miles of anadromous steelhead habitat.|$|E

From introduction: <b>Fishways</b> are {{generally}} classified as pool and weir type {{with or without}} orifices, Denil type and vertical slot <b>fishways.</b> Culverts built with some type of baffle system to assist fish passage are known as culvert <b>fishways.</b> Pool and weir <b>fishways</b> are the earliest <b>fishways.</b> They were later modified with the provision of orifices in the weir walls. In some structures, the weirs are also provided with chutes. Pool and weir <b>fishways</b> have been popular in Europe.

Based on the current situation of <b>fishways</b> construction in China, this paper demonstrated the legislative prospect of environmental flows, and analyzed the historical reason of depression of <b>fishways.</b> Focusing on adaptable measures of <b>fishways</b> development to legislative and ecological water requirements, four proposals were provided, which included strengthening the supervision, promoting the ecological integration, exploring the behavior of fish, and investigating the ecohydraulics of <b>fishways...</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1968, {{the provincial}} {{and federal governments}} {{completed}} {{the construction of a}} causeway between the communities of Moncton and Riverview to provide a crossing over the river, and to keep water levels from impeding agricultural production. This was a benefit for the federal government at the time, which had constantly maintained the dykes in the area. It also benefited the provincial government, as the federal government was willing to fund the $3million project, but not a bridge. Although the causeway was equipped with a <b>fishway,</b> problems arose when fish were unable to cross it freely due to sedimentation build-up; some 82percent of the salmon were prevented from travelling upstream by the structure. The sediment accumulated in the [...] of river downstream from the causeway, with over 10million cubic metres (13million cubic yards) of silt deposited in the first three years following construction. Several reports from 1969 to 1971 described its impact on the aquatic ecosystem, and proposals for amendments to the causeway gates were released, but no action was taken. In 1976 and 1977, reports pointed out several problems related to the gates' function due to erosion, winter ice jams, and [...] "unsatisfactory <b>fishway</b> operation".|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, the Niles Report {{proposed}} an additional four {{modifications to the}} causeway project: to either replace the <b>fishway,</b> open the gates during peak fish migration, open the gates permanently, or replace the entire causeway with a bridge. An Environmental Impact Assessment study was commissioned in 2003 to develop and summarise these options, and on its completion in 2005, it announced the recognition of [...] "Option 3" [...] and [...] "Option 4" [...] as possible solutions. The first option had been ruled out following the evaluation of other fish passage models, which were deemed inapplicable to the river. The second, suggesting systematic gate-opening periods, was ruled out because of the inability to cater to every marine species' migration periods. Option 4 was split into three sub-options, mainly to list possible bridge lengths: 170, 280, and 315metres (190, 310, and 344yards). The provincial government later accepted the proposal on 6 December 2006, and selected [...] "Option 4B" [...] on 7 August 2007, which called for a [...] bridge {{in the place of}} the causeway.|$|E

40|$|Many in-stream {{structures}} {{result in}} obstruction to fish migrations, thus preventing access to spawning grounds and other habitat areas which provide life cycle requirements for reproduction, rearing and shelter. Frequently, <b>fishways</b> are constructed {{at the site}} of the obstruction to provide access to habitat for various species. Conventional approaches to fish passage generally consist of 2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7 structures (e. g. concrete) or physical transport systems.

40|$|Numerous {{types and}} {{configurations}} of nature-like <b>fishways,</b> constructed primarily {{of rock and}} other natural materials, have been employed throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. Design of nature-like <b>fishways</b> focuses on producing hydraulic conditions that satisfy passage criteria for target fish species, but seldom incorporate the stable morphology of natural channels into their design. In recent years, designers have employed new geomorphically-based approach to engineer and construct <b>fishways,</b> founded on mimicking the bed morphology and composition of steeper natural channels. These geomorphically-based <b>fishways</b> are presumed to more likely satisfy broad fish passage objectives if constructed with a morphology and slope similar to natural channels that the target fish species and life-stages are known to reside and traverse. Additionally, natural bedforms found in steeper channels are more persistent {{due in part to}} their ability to dissipate energy efficiently over a wide range of streamflows. These geomorphically-based <b>fishways</b> have been applied to fish passage at small dams and road-stream crossings on smaller waterways.

Home to five species of {{anadromous}} Pacific salmon, the nine mainstem dams on the Columbia River and four on the Snake River were constructed with <b>fishways</b> to enable salmon to return upstream to natal spawning areas. Most of these dams were constructed with two fishways; one adjacent to each riverbank. The <b>fishways</b> have overflow weirs with submerged orifices and some vertical slot structures. Fish lifts constructed at Bonneville Dam in the 1940 s were used to pass white sturgeon upstream but their use was discontinued in the 1950 s because the lifts were ineffective for passing adult salmon.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} fulfill the {{requirements}} of the EU Water Framework Directive concerning the restoration of fish passage in rivers, various types of (near-natural and technical) <b>fishways</b> have been built in recent years. For optimization of planned structures as well as for monitoring of the performance of existing <b>fishways,</b> their hydraulics has to be studied. 3 D hydrodynamic numerical modelling is a useful tool to predict hydraulic quantities and analyse flow pattern. Many studies using hydraulic simulations deal with technical <b>fishways.</b> In contrast, nature-oriented <b>fishways</b> have rarely been numerically modelled so far. In the framework of R 2 ̆ 6 D activities at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, a high resolution 3 D-hydraulic model of a section of a nature-oriented bypass channel (rock cascade pass) has been developed. The basis of a hydraulic model is a 3 D-model of the <b>fishway’s</b> topography. Since <b>fishways</b> of a nature-oriented design type are characterized by highly irregular structures, the build-up of such a model is very challenging. In this study, the method of terrestrial laser scanning was used for detailed geodata acquisition. The hydraulic model was validated using, inter alia, acoustic Doppler velocity measurements. Simulations using the computational fluid dynamics software FLOW- 3 D were performed for two hydraulic scenarios. The simulated hydraulic quantities (velocities, water levels) and their distribution along the vertical and horizontal axes have been investigated and compared to critical values concerning fish passability specified in technical standards. A method of categorization of flow patterns is proposed, which enables a schematic visualization of complex flow conditions. In this way, potentially critical zones can be located and specific flow patterns can be identified. This method of analysis has a high potential in terms of addressing environmental issues concerning nature-oriented <b>fishways</b> and river restoration projects...|$|R

The Columbia River Basin is reported to be the most dammed river system in North America.
