Although there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young. In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) largely due to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{possible}} phosphorus deficiencies in farmed animals, phosphorus is supplied {{in the form}} of inorganic feed phosphates. Consequences of deficiencies are known and well documented. The initial effect is a fall in blood plasma levels, followed by withdrawal of calcium and phosphorus from the skeleton.

Other deficiency includes reduced fertility in cattle, but also reduced milk yield (milk contains on average 1 g of P per kg), stiffness and in extreme cases even enlarged joints or deformed bones and lameness. Other well known symptoms are In layers reduced egg yield and, in case of chicks, reduced <b>hatchability,</b> together with cage layer fatigue syndrome. Also for all species osteomalacia and reduced fertility are possible. All these symptoms are more or less irreversible, resulting in economic losses for the farmer.|$|E

50|$|Females {{will lay}} an egg a day if {{kept on the}} proper diet. Nesting sites can be as spartan as a quiet corner or a {{depression}} in the ground against a wall. Preferably, a clump of grass, tea tree branches, or pile of loose herbage should be provided. Often a hen will lay eggs on the aviary floor {{without the use of}} a nest. This is a sign that the birds are not content with the existing facilities and the provision of a sheltered nest site may result in a nest being built. The cock usually selects the nest site. The nest is a simple scrape in the ground, lined with grasses and is built by the hen with some assistance from the cock. The eggs measuring 25 x 19mm are variable in colour form the palest of browns to dark olive and peppered with fine black spots. Clutch size varies from 4-13, but occasionally a hen will be found incubating upwards of 20 eggs. It is usually a combined clutch from a number of hens and due to the difficulties of turning and covering a clutch of that size, <b>hatchability</b> is often poor.

50|$|Bisphenol A is a {{chemical}} {{used to make}} polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resin, and other chemicals. It is also weakly estrogenic, {{and many of the}} same effects of oestradiol and oestrone can be seen with this compound. In the male fathead minnows, reduced somatic growth is seen. With females, egg production and <b>hatchability</b> are reduced. The effects take place more quickly in females than in males, though. The effect of low pH on the fathead minnow has also been studied. Though survival was minimally affected by extended exposure to low pH, the minnow behavior was abnormal. They showed stress behaviors, such as surface swimming and hyperactivity. In addition, some deformities also were brought about by long exposure to low pH. In both males and females, their heads became smaller than normal. Males lose some of the brightness of their color. Females become heavy with eggs but may not spawn, and the number of eggs per female is reduced. The eggs themselves come out abnormal, fragile and lacking turgidity, and the lower the pH, the less likely the eggs are to eventually hatch. In fathead minnows exposed to cattle feedlot effluent, the males are feminized and the females are defeminized. The male fathead minnows have reduced testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size, while the females have a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio, which is defeminized sex hormone ratio.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine factors that affect the <b>hatchability</b> of parabionts. These experiments included the effects of genetic relationship, shell and/or membrane removal, egg storage, degree of sterility of surroundings during parabiosis, and embryonic age {{at the time of}} parabiosis. The degree of genetic relationship (full-sib, half-sib, or nonrelated) had little effect on the <b>hatchability</b> of single or pairs of parabionts.

Injections of thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) {{had no effect on}} <b>hatchability</b> when injected at setting but significantly (P<. 05) improved <b>hatchability</b> when injected at 25 days of incubation.

40|$|Abstract: The common {{practice}} of candling chicken eggs during incubation, allows classification of embryonic mortality at three stages: early, mid-term and late embryonic development. The {{purpose of this}} study was to estimate genetic parameters of embryonic mortality at three stages of incubation as well as fertility and <b>hatchability</b> in an ancient chicken breed. <b>Hatchability</b> of fertile eggs had a favourable genetic correlation with early (- 0. 09) and mid-term (- 0. 36) embryonic mortality. <b>Hatchability</b> of eggs set was favourably correlated with mid-term embryonic mortality (- 0. 40) but not with early (0. 22) embryonic mortality. Genetic correlations between fertility and <b>hatchability</b> of fertile eggs and <b>hatchability</b> of eggs set were 0. 20 and 0. 86, respectively. Genetic correlations between late and early embryonic mortality (0. 11) and mid-term embryonic mortality (0. 34) were favourable, but not between early and mid-term (- 0. 78) embryonic mortality. Mid-term embryonic mortality and <b>hatchability</b> of fertile eggs were both candidate traits for effective selection against embryonic mortality in our breed. Benefits are brought by the high heritability value of mid-term embryonic mortality and its advantageous correlation with fertility, late embryonic mortality, <b>hatchability</b> of fertile eggs and <b>hatchability</b> of eggs set.

40|$|Poultry {{production}} at all scales of operation is wholly {{dependent on the}} supply of day-old chicks. Fertility and <b>hatchability</b> are two major parameters that highly influence the supply of day-old chicks. Fertility refers to the percentage of incubated eggs that are fertile while <b>hatchability</b> is the percentage of fertile eggs that hatch. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} factors that influence fertility and <b>hatchability</b> of eggs. For the <b>hatchability</b> traits, breed has little effect on <b>hatchability</b> of poultry eggs, although light breeds have been reported to have higher fertility and <b>hatchability.</b> The diet of breeder poultry should be adequate in both quality and quantity to meet the recommended levels set out in the feed standards for the category. The most influential egg parameters that influence <b>hatchability</b> are: weight, shell thickness and porosity, shape index (described as maximum breadth to length ratio) and the consistency of the contents. Heat stress reduces the external and internal egg qualities. Heat stress affects all phases of semen production in breeder cocks. <b>Hatchability</b> for small eggs is lower compared to that of medium and large eggs. There are many factors contributing to the failure of a fertile egg to hatch which include lethal genes, insufficient nutrients in the egg and exposure to conditions that do not {{meet the needs of the}} developing embryo. Breeder factors that affect <b>hatchability</b> include strain, health, nutrition and age of the flock, egg size, weight and quality, egg storage duration and conditions. The optimum temperature range for poultry is 12 - 26 o C. Fertile eggs should not be stored for more than 10 - 14 days, after 14 days of storage; <b>hatchability</b> begins to decline significantly. The position (large end up or vice versa) of egg storage influences <b>hatchability.</b> Eggs stored with the small end up have higher <b>hatchability</b> as compared to the large end up. Incubation of fertile eggs can be done naturally by a broody hen or in an incubator. The broody hen provides the fertile eggs with optimum environmental conditions (temperature, egg turning and humidity) to stimulate embryonic development until hatching. The incubator is a simulated artificial design that mimics the broody hens role of providing fertile eggs with optimum environmental conditions (temperature, egg turning and humidity) to stimulate embryonic development until hatching. A constant incubation temperature of 37. 8 o C is the thermal homeostasis in the chick embryo and gives the best embryo development and <b>hatchability.</b> Mortality is seen if the temperature drops below 35. 6 o C or rises above 39. 4 o C for a number of hours. Egg turning during incubation is critical for successful hatching and influences <b>hatchability.</b> No turning of eggs during incubation results in low <b>hatchability</b> and delays hatch by a few days...|$|E
