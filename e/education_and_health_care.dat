The government and transportation sectors have remained relatively constant between 2007 and 2013, however the manufacturing sector has seen steady decline, mirroring national averages. The construction and real estate sectors saw large declines attributable to the poor housing market during the economic downturn.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{each city}} {{has a couple of}} {{distinct}} advantages that the other city lacks—Sudbury is at the centre of a larger economic sphere due to the city's, and Northeastern Ontario's, larger population, but Thunder Bay is advantaged by air, rail and shipping traffic due to its prime location along major continental transportation routes. The Thunder Bay International Airport is the third busiest airport in Ontario after Toronto Pearson International Airport and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, carrying some 600,000 passengers in 2004 with over 100 flights and four international flights daily. Sudbury's economy, in which the largest sectors of employment are government-related fields such as <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> is somewhat more diversified than Thunder Bay's, which is still based primarily on natural resources and manufacturing. Yet in the era of government cutbacks, Thunder Bay's economy has been less prone to recession and unemployment.|$|E

During this time Prince Edward Island launched Waste Watch, becoming the first Canadian province to offer waste management services to every home and business resulting in a 65% waste diversion rate and closure of many community landfills. Investments were also made to expand renewable energy use with the development of the North Cape Wind Farm in West Prince, strengthening Prince Edward Island's credentials as a national leader in environmental sustainability.|$|E
40|$|D. Cur. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to describe a model to facilitate collaboration between the institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services {{in order to promote}} psychiatric clinical nursing education, with guidelines to operationalise the model. In spite of the calls by statutory bodies and contemporary legislation for collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services, there are few instances where formalised collaborative ventures exist to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education. Since the move of nursing education from hospital-based schools to colleges and universities, there was no attempt to redefine the most appropriate roles for nurse educators and clinical facilitators regarding student teaching and learning, given this realignment. The consequence was that the relationship between these institutions is characterised by territoriality; a lack of integration of knowledge and expertise of nurse educators and clinical facilitators; a lack of sharing the necessary resources to facilitate cooperative teaching thus increasing the existence of academia-service gap and/or theory-practice gap to develop. There was therefore a need to develop a model with guidelines for operationalisation of the model to facilitate collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education. The research questions that emerged were: • What is the meaning of collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services within psychiatric clinical nursing education? • How can collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services be facilitated to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education? To realise the aim of this research, the following objectives are formulated: • to explore and describe the meaning of the concept “collaboration” between the institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services within a psychiatric clinical educational context (theoretical and empirical perspectives); • to explore and describe the perceptions of nurse educators, nurse managers, and (i) clinical facilitators with regard to how collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services can be facilitated to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education; • to conceptualise the identified concepts of the model for collaboration to facilitate psychiatric clinical nursing education; • to describe the model to facilitate collaboration between institutions of higher <b>education</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services, evaluate the model and describe guidelines for its operationalisation. The study was conducted in four phases. Phase One of the study involved an exploration and description of the meaning of collaboration within psychiatric clinical nursing education in accordance with Rodgers and Knafl’s evolutionary method of concept analysis (Rodgers & Knafl, 1993 : 77 - 90) and empirical meaning description from the participants’ perspective. Integration of the theoretical and empirical meaning of collaboration formed the basis on which a conceptual map was designed. Content analysis of literature was done using deductive and inductive reasoning strategies, synthesis, and inference and derivation as described by Chinn & Kramer (1995 : 63 - 67), and Walker and Avant, (1983 : 58 - 62). Theoretical validity was ensured (Chinn & Jacobs, 1987 : 208). A conceptual map constituting the four phases of collaboration was described...|$|R
