5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{sit down}} with Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band.

We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E
