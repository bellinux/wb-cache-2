500|$|Sonia was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes at age seven, and began taking daily insulin injections. Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old. After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten.</b> Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E
500|$|Though the {{committee}} made most decisions involving the Leafs, Smythe {{was not a}} hands-off owner and was constantly fighting with his son. Stafford commented: [...] "My father has always given me lots of rope. When I was thirty, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> years ahead of everybody. But at forty, I'm ten years behind everybody." [...] Finally, in 1961, Stafford resigned from the Silver Seven and this spurred Conn. After four years of fighting, he offered to sell his shares to Stafford and in November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a partnership of his son, Ballard, and Bassett for $2.3million—a handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier. At first, Smythe thought the sale was only to his son, and {{when he learned that}} it was to the threesome, he was furious with Stafford. He had hoped that Stafford would eventually keep the Gardens for his son Tommy. Despite his misgivings, Smythe did not cancel the deal.|$|E
500|$|Music {{historian}} Simon Reynolds {{argues that}} McLaren {{came into his}} own as an auteur only after the group's break-up, with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist. Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, [...] "oday, Swindle is viewed {{by many as the}} truth" [...] (despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of [...] "My Way"). Temple points out that McLaren's characterisation was intended as [...] "a big fucking joke—that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a joke that they were completely manufactured." [...] (In his final onscreen scene in the film, McLaren declares that he was planning the Sex Pistols affair, [...] "Ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> years old! Ever since Elvis Presley joined the army!" [...]) Temple acknowledges that McLaren ultimately [...] "perhaps took this too much to heart." ...|$|E

I was struck by the description of the dark and mysterious friendship that existed between them—by the uniqueness of the world the two girls had created for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Germans began bombing London {{during the}} Blitz in 1940, {{her family had}} a number of narrow escapes as bombs dropped close to their home. She and her brother John were sent to safety in the country, and then to the United States, where she spent a year living with an uncle. She recalls, [...] "It was 1941; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten,</b> John was nearly six. We were to sail from Glasgow in a convoy, on a ship that was {{evacuating}} children." [...] During her year stay in Florida, she was asked by the British War Relief Society to help raise money by entertaining at various benefits, which she then did for a number of weeks. [...] "Thus I broke into show business singing", she writes.|$|E

By the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E

2500|$|Radner {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to Jewish parents, Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a {{business}}man. Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive Steve Ballmer. She grew up in Detroit with a nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called [...] "Dibby" [...] (and on whom she based her famous character Emily Litella), and an older brother named Michael. She attended the exclusive University Liggett School in Detroit (it began its relocation to Grosse Pointe later that year). Toward {{the end of her}} life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, It's Always Something, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: [...] "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she took me to a doctor who put me on Dexedrine diet pills when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> years old." ...|$|E
