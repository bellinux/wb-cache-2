A practical challenge facing the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is to provide real-time forecasting of current 8  h average ozone exposure over the entire conterminous United States. Such real-time forecasting is now provided as spatial <b>forecast</b> <b>maps</b> of current 8  h average ozone defined as the average of the previous four hours, current hour, and predictions for the next three hours.

We introduce a downscaler fusion model based on first differences of real-time monitoring data and numerical model output. The model has a flexible coefficient structure with an efficient computational strategy to fit model parameters. This strategy can be viewed as hybrid in that it blends offline model fitting with online predictions followed by fast spatial interpolation to produce the desired real-time <b>forecast</b> <b>maps.</b> Model validation for the eastern US shows consequential improvement of our fully inferential approach compared with the existing implementations...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} RELM {{forecast}} of future earthquakes in California that is primarily {{based on the}} pattern informatics (PI) method. This method identifies regions that have systematic fluctuations in seismicity, {{and it has been}} demonstrated to be successful. A PI <b>forecast</b> <b>map</b> originally published on 19 February 2002 for southern California successfully forecast the locations of sixteen of eighteen M> 5 earthquakes during the past three years. The method has also been successfully applied to Japan and on a worldwide basis. An alternative approach to earthquake forecasting is the relative intensity (RI) method. The RI <b>forecast</b> <b>map</b> is based on recent levels of seismic activity of small earthquakes. Recent advances in the PI method show considerable improvement, particularly when compared with the RI method using relative operating characteristic (ROC) diagrams for binary forecasts. The RELM application requires a probability for each location for a number of magnitude bins over a five year period. We have therefore constructed a hybrid forecast in which we combine the PI method with the RI method to compute a map of probabilities for events occurring at any location, rather than just the most probable locations. These probabilities are further converted, using Gutenberg-Richter scaling laws, to anticipated rates of future earthquakes that can be evaluated using the RELM test. ...|$|E
