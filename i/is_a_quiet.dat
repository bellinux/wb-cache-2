25|$|The borzoi <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> but {{athletic}} and independent dog. Most borzois are almost silent, barking only very rarely. They {{do not have}} strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi is extremely smart and requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but will turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically however, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they know well. Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Despite their size, borzois adapt very well to suburban life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.|$|E

25|$|Lone Islands: The Lone Islands are {{the most}} populous and busiest of the islands in the Eastern Ocean. There are three of them: Doorn, Avra, and Felimath. Felimath <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> rural island of pastures, mostly used for grazing sheep. Avra {{is the home of}} Bernstead, Duke Bern's estate (as well as others). It is a {{slightly}} more mountainous island, famous for its vast vineyards. Doorn is the largest island and also the most important, for its main town of Narrowhaven. Narrowhaven is the largest island nexus of trade in the whole of the Ocean. Merchants and goods pass through its harbor and its streets from all the mainland kingdoms and all the islands. There is a unique intersection there between Narnians, Calormenes, and Islanders. The Lone Islands were restored to Narnian rule by King Caspian X himself on his voyage {{to the end of the}} world. (They had been attached to Narnia already at the time of the White Witch, and then High King Peter ruled them under the title Emperor of the Lone Islands.) (PC). Prior to being reclaimed by Caspian, they were overseen by Gumpas, and were a great center of the slave trade. Following Caspian X's visit, the Lone Islands were ruled for him by Duke Bern.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> retirement {{in the country with}} the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E
