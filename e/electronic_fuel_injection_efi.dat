Some [...] lighter than the SOHC Vega engine, it develops maximum power at 5,600rpm and is redlined at 6,500rpm, whereas the SOHC Vega engine peaks at 4,400rpm and runs to 5,000rpm.

The Rebel's Electrojector equipped engine was rated at [...] This {{was to have been}} the first mass-produced engine with a transistorized [...] "brain box" [...] fuel injection system. A Rambler Rebel with the optional EFI was tested by Motor Trend, and they recorded this sedan going faster from a standing start than the 1957 Chevrolet Corvette with mechanical fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|Gordon {{returned}} to Sprint Cup in 2011, but for only 25 races. He {{returned to}} Dodge and {{started his own}} brand of energy drink, Speed Energy, as a sponsor. Gordon's best finish {{of the year was}} 16th at the Daytona 500, though he also parked the car in ten starts. In May, 2007 Formula One Champion Kimi Räikkönen tested Gordon's car at Infineon, with plans of Gordon fielding an additional car for Räikkönen at the Toyota/Save Mart 350, but he crashed the car and the deal fell through. He attempted the 2012 Daytona 500 with sponsorship from Mapei and Speed Energy. During practice at Bristol Motor Speedway, Gordon's <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection,</b> or <b>EFI,</b> shorted out and was not repairable, therefore, the team was forced to withdraw. It was then announced that the team would not enter until Sonoma Raceway, which to date is their last attempt and start in the Sprint Cup Series. At the time, Gordon was the last owner/driver in the series. He later stated he had been unhappy with the gap between the larger and smaller teams in spending, which granted the former an advantage.|$|R

2500|$|In newer designs {{controlled}} by a “traction computer,” each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or “kW reference”, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or “kW feedback”, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays {{a central role in}} this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a “back-up” in case of engine overload. [...] Modern locomotives fitted with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>EFI)</b> may have no mechanical governor; however a “virtual” load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.|$|E

50|$|The Mitsubishi Astron or 4G5 engine, is {{a series}} of straight-four {{internal}} combustion engines first built by Mitsubishi Motors in 1972. Engine displacement ranged from 1.8 to 2.6 litres, {{making it one of the}} largest four-cylinder engines of its time. It became the first Japanese production engine to combine both <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>EFI)</b> and turbocharging.|$|E
50|$|Because {{they can}} be {{restrictive}} and because they rapidly run out of measurement upside on the high-end of airflow, VAF meters are virtually never used with aftermarket <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>EFI).</b> They are often replaced on factory systems with speed-density or MAF conversions. Some programmable engine management systems like Motec's can be configured to access VAF as engine loading information.|$|E

50|$|Both {{approaches}} are used {{almost exclusively on}} <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>EFI)</b> engines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0-5.0 volt or a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal that {{is proportional to the}} air mass flow rate, and both sensors have an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor incorporated into their housings for most post OBDII vehicles. Vehicles prior to 1996 could have MAF without an IAT. An example is 1994 Infiniti Q45.|$|E
50|$|The {{entry level}} 1.3 and 1.5 litre models lack {{some of the}} {{features}} of the 1.6 and 1.8 litre models to cut down costs and thus lower the list price. They used 4G13 and 4G15 engines. The early models used carburetors; in 1998 Proton replaced them with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>EFI).</b> However, in 2001, Proton replaced the Mitsubishi EFi module with a Siemens VDO unit claimed to cause slight power loss.|$|E
