500|$|When {{starting}} serialization the manga was unpopular and {{was close}} to being cancelled. Although Sorachi {{was pleased with the}} first tankōbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. In order to <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> <b>popularity,</b> the author introduce new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants. [...] Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tankōbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found {{that he did not have}} [...] "any fresh material to use." [...] During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable of making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past. Although Sorachi has already planned the series' ending, he is not sure when the manga is going to reach that point due to the characters requiring development to behave the way he wants.|$|E
500|$|Katsuya Eguchi, {{who managed}} Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, {{produced}} Wii Sports. With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach {{people who had}} not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way. Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended Wii Sports to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this. Wii Sports {{was designed as a}} simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers. Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity. At one point in development, Mario characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players who preferred Miis. The game supports a [...] and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second, and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion. Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible. Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play Wii Sports, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players {{would be more likely to}} play Wii Sports through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> <b>popularity</b> by word of mouth.|$|E
