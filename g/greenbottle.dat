25|$|The Calliphoridae (commonly {{known as}} blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, <b>greenbottles,</b> or cluster flies) are {{a family of}} insects in the order Diptera, with 1,100 known species. The maggot larvae, often used as fishing bait, are known as gentles. The family {{is known to be}} polyphyletic, but much remains disputed {{regarding}} proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, and Rhiniidae).|$|R
5000|$|De Pledge is, {{compared}} to his classmates, a genius. Posh and formal, {{he is the}} only member of the class who does not give Dr Pym any headaches. He was introduced into the show following <b>Greenbottle's</b> brief exit but remained in the cast after his return up until his voice, Richard Harding-Browne, joined the air force. De Pledge is able to answer almost any question given to him although given how little work the fourth form manages to complete this is not saying much. Despite being the teacher's pet, he occasionally annoys Dr Pym with his pompous manner and his hastiness to answer questions not directed at him. He resists taking part in Bottomly's schemes but is occasionally tricked into contributing anyway. He is nicknamed [...] "Pickles" [...] after Bottomly decides his full name is too difficult to remember.|$|R
25|$|Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in {{this family}} are often {{metallic}} in appearance and between 10 and 14mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster fly, <b>greenbottles,</b> or black blowfly. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, {{and a large number}} of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16km) away.|$|R

50|$|Other characters, such as Mr Snootles {{played by}} Frank McCarron, were {{introduced}} as the show's popularity increased. The name {{was changed to}} Yes, What? after studio executives decided the old title was too long and something more catchy was needed. Richard Harding-Browne {{first appeared in the}} show as a barrister in episode 49 and was later given his own character, de Pledge, after Jack Craig-Gardiner's health prevented him from playing <b>Greenbottle.</b> <b>Greenbottle</b> temporarily left the show on the pretext of attending university in episode 342 and de Pledge arrived in episode 344. <b>Greenbottle</b> came back in episode 394 and the cast of four pupils was used. In episode 437, de Pledge left the show as Harding-Browne had enlisted himself into the air-force.|$|E
5000|$|Embrik Strand (2 June 1876 [...] - [...] 3 November 1947) was an arachnologist who {{classified}} many insect and spider species, {{including the}} <b>greenbottle</b> blue tarantula.|$|E
40|$|Calyptrate fly {{populations were}} {{monitored}} with sticky traps {{at the following}} sites in Hampshire, UK during August to November 1998 : a landfill and composting site (Paulsgrove), a site adjacent to this landfill (Port Solent), a site with no landfill nearby (Gosport), and a composting site with no landfill nearby. Overall, house flies Musca domestica (Linnaeus) and lesser house flies Fannia spp. were not important constituents of the dipteran catch, while bluebottles (Calliphora spp.) and <b>greenbottles</b> (Lucilia spp.) comprised approximately 12 % of the total. Very large fly populations were found at the two composting sites, and {{it seems likely that}} these provide ideal breeding grounds for a range of fly species since they offer an abundance of warm decaying organic matter. Large fly populations were also evident at the landfill site. The suitability of household waste for the development of calyptrate Diptera was confirmed in a controlled trial: a mean of 0. 43 adults emerged per kilo of one-week-old waste. Since many hundreds of tonnes of waste are delivered to the landfill daily, {{it is clear that the}} landfill is likely to substantially increase the local population of calyptrate flies. However, the data suggest that there was little movement of Diptera from the landfill to Port Solent situated approximately 500 m away. The most important calyptrate flies at this site were the cluster flies Pollenia rudis (Fabricius) and P. amentaria (Scopoli); the landfill site is unlikely to provide a suitable breeding site for these flies, as the larvae develop as parasites of earthworms. Significantly more flies emerged from one-week-old than from two-week-old household waste. A comparison of different barriers to the emergence of adult house flies from waste demonstrated that sacking provided an effective barrier to fly emergence, but that soil did not differ significantly from control treatments. If managed appropriately, it seems that the use of sacking over landfill waste could substantially reduce associated fly populations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Greenbottle</b> is {{a member}} of a large family who all appear to be {{suffering}} from madness. His frequent meetings with them invariably make him late for class. He explains ludicrous tales by way of an excuse for his tardiness, often involving his family members or descriptions of his ludicrously designed house. He considers himself an expert on all topics, boasting that whatever subject the class is studying at the time is his best. He often claims to possess skills he really lacks, such as a brilliant singing voice and an expertise in poetry. This does not deter him from demonstrating his self-proclaimed talents. The extent of Greenbottle's lunacy is ambiguous as it is unclear how many of his eccentric habits are feigned to waste time and how many are inherent to his personality. His habit of saying [...] "Yes" [...] all the time causes Dr Pym to answer [...] "Yes, What?", to which <b>Greenbottle</b> will often expound ridiculous theories or family stories. <b>Greenbottle</b> was played by Jack Craig-Gardiner although he left the cast for a brief period due to illness. Craig-Gardiner contributed many other minor voices to the series. For example, <b>Greenbottle</b> Senior and the boxer 'Dangerous Dynamite Dixon' from Episode 228.|$|E
50|$|The name {{green bottle fly}} or <b>greenbottle</b> fly {{is applied}} to {{numerous}} species of Calliphoridae or blow fly, in the genera Lucilia and Phaenicia (the latter is sometimes considered a subgenus of the former).|$|E
50|$|Following the {{successful}} {{launch of the}} <b>GreenBottle</b> milk container, the company unveiled its designs for a paper wine bottle. The launch was met with international enthusiasm, gaining press coverage, and eventually sales, from around the world.|$|E
50|$|<b>GreenBottle</b> was {{the winner}} of the Best Small Companies {{category}} at the 2012 Rethink Awards, hosted by Planet Workshops.A few weeks later, it was also shortlisted for Most Sustainable Small Organisation by the International Green Awards.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{the paper}} bottle can be {{composted}} {{in as little}} as 12 weeks and recycled with paper recycling. The <b>GreenBottle</b> bottle uses less than one third of the amount of plastic in a standard UK milk bottle.|$|E
50|$|Lucilia caesar is {{a member}} of the fly family Calliphoridae {{commonly}} known as blow flies. L. caesar is commonly referred to as the common <b>greenbottle.</b> The adult flies typically feed on pollen and nectar of flowers. The larvae feed mainly on carrion.|$|E
50|$|These flies {{are found}} in most areas of the world, {{primarily}} the Western Hemisphere and especially California and Australia, and the most well-known species is the common <b>greenbottle,</b> Lucilia sericata (or Phaenicia sericata, depending on authority), though there are other common species such as Lucilia caesar, Lucilia cuprina, Lucilia coeruleiviridis, and Lucilia illustris.|$|E
50|$|Chromatopelma is a genus of spiders in {{the family}} Theraphosidae (tarantulas), with the sole species Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens. A native of the Paraguaná peninsula, Venezuela, it {{is known as the}} <b>greenbottle</b> blue tarantula, and has some of the most {{dramatic}} colouring of any spider species. Adult greenbottles have metallic blue legs, a blue-green carapace and a vibrant orange abdomen.|$|E
50|$|Throughout his adventures, Rayman has {{accumulated}} {{a number of}} allies. The original game introduces the Magician, Tarayzan, the Musician, and Joe the Extra-Terrestrial, Bzzit the Mosquito, and Betilla the Fairy. Meanwhile, Rayman 2 introduces a largely new cast including the bumbling Globox, the helpful flying <b>greenbottle</b> Murfy, the numerous Teensies, and the mystical Ly the Fairy.|$|E
50|$|<b>GreenBottle</b> was {{developed}} in 2005 by inventor Martin Myerscough following a chance encounter with a waste tip manager. Myerscough {{was told that the}} biggest problem at waste tips is the abundance of plastic milk bottles. With less than 8 years of landfill in the UK remaining, Myerscough was inspired by his son's papier-mâché balloon to create a moulded paper bottle with a thin plastic lining.|$|E
5000|$|Mr Snootles first {{appears in}} episode 75 as a {{photographer}} attempting to take a snap of the class. His full name is Basil Cornelius Snootles. His unusual quavering voice leads to much mirth among the class. He re-appears in episodes 103 and 104 and is subsequently hired as the school caretaker. He is an avid bird lover and tries to give the boys a lesson on [...] "bird-life, its meaning and importance" [...] after being elevated to assistant school-master. He is prone to singing while he works which annoys Dr Pym. He continually pesters Dr Pym about his wages as it appears he doesn't receive any. His appearances in the class-room lead the boys, particularly Bottomly and <b>Greenbottle,</b> to imitate his voice. Mr Snootles is often a victim of Dr Pym's bullying, both intentional and accidental, and the strained {{relationship between the two}} is used as a frequent subject of humour. Like <b>Greenbottle,</b> Mr Snootles says the word [...] "Yes" [...] often, prompting Dr Pym to say, [...] "Yes, what?" [...] He was played by Frank McCarron who also provided a number of minor voices for the series.|$|E
50|$|<b>GreenBottle</b> has an {{estimated}} 10% {{of the carbon}} footprint of glass and weighs just one sixth of an average wine glass bottle, making it much more fuel efficient to transport both in bulk and for consumers. Glass is often regarded as a green form of packaging but its production process is highly energy intensive and whilst 62% of glass is recycled in the UK, only 50% of this is remelted. The balance is either destined for land fill, road aggregate or fibreglass insulation manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Douglas McKenzie (Zag) {{was born}} on 22 March 1918 in Gloucester, England. He enlisted in the Australian Army on 12 July 1940 during World War II and became a {{prisoner}} of war at Changi. As a corporal, McKenzie, and another prisoner, Bill West, annually ran a mock version of the Melbourne Cup in the prison by using bull frogs. In 1942 his frog, <b>Greenbottle,</b> won the mock cup trophy: made of cardboard, which McKenzie cherished upon return to Australia in 1945. He was discharged on 17 January 1946.|$|E
50|$|The {{bluebottle}} fly or bottlebee (Calliphora vomitoria) is {{a common}} blow fly found in most {{areas of the world}} and is the type species for the genus Calliphora. Its larva, used as fishing bait, is called a maggot, while its pupa, also widely used for bait, is called a caster. Similar species include the <b>greenbottle</b> fly, a close relative that can be distinguished by its bright green metallic colouring. Bluebottle fly adults feed on nectar, while the larvae feed on carcasses of dead animals. Adults are also pollinators to some flowers with strong odor.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic bottles require up to 4.5 {{times the}} amount carbon to produce {{compared}} to a milk <b>GreenBottle.</b> Most plastic, even if it has been recycled several times, is eventually bound for landfill where it persists indefinitely. In 2010, there were warnings that the UK had just eight years of landfill remaining [...] and the EU Landfill Directive legally binds the UK to reduce its municipal waste, by 2020, to 35% of 1995 dumping levels. Much of the 15 million plastic bottles consumed daily in the UK still ends up in landfill where it will persist for more than 500 years. Only 35% of PET bottles are recycled.|$|E
5000|$|Based on this film, an Australian {{radio show}} was made called Fourth Form at St Percys, which quickly changed its title to Yes, what! The show {{features}} a teacher (Percy Pym) who sounded like Will Hay {{trying to teach}} a bunch of unruly children, the worst of who are <b>Greenbottle</b> (who sounded like Moore Marriott) and Bottomley. They never quite manage {{to get through a}} lesson through endless interruptions which easily lead the teacher astray which leads to punishments (hitting with a stick) being handed out. The shows were about 12 minutes long and normally began with chimes and; [...] "Good morning boys! Good morning sir" [...] The series lasted from 1935 till 1937 and cost A$10 an episode to make. Over seventy years later, it is still on a number of radio stations in Australia and is currently available on CD with one of the stars talking about the show.|$|E
50|$|The show first {{aired on}} the 23rd of June, 1936 at 9:15pm. The show's {{timeslot}} was occasionally altered {{but for the}} most part it was given air twice per week, on Tuesday and Thursday nights. 520. episodes were produced, the first 50 or so of which went live to air without being recorded. A total of 130 hours were broadcast before the show finally ended in 1941, two years after the outbreak of the Second World War. However, the show was rerun countless times even outside of Australia, with New Zealand and South Africa both popular audiences. Episodes 209 to 520 were the most commonly broadcast as earlier episodes were not as fast-paced nor regarded as favourably. For instance, the character <b>Greenbottle</b> initially resembled an old man rather than the falsetto miscreant audiences were more familiar with. Dawe later attempted to revive the character of Dr Pym in the series Dr Pym's Progress but this was a critical and commercial failure.|$|E
50|$|Yes, What? {{began its}} life as The Fourth Form at St. Percy's. It {{was based on}} the radio serial The Fourth Form at St. Michael's by Will Hay, which aired in the 1920s. Rex Dawe, a young Adelaide broadcaster, wrote the program after having the concept pitched to him by Rex Heading. 5AD Programme Manager Morrie Chapman granted a fifty shillings budget for the show as well as an {{additional}} ten shillings for the writer / producer. The cast were mostly chosen from a youth production group The Kangaroo Club. Fifteen-year-old Ralph Peterson was hired to play the larrikin Bottomly and is often described as being a classroom rebel himself. The character <b>Greenbottle</b> was to be voiced by Jack Craig-Gardiner, born in 1915 so only a few years Dawe's junior. The youngest member of the class, Jim Williams, played Standforth, beginning when he was 14. Dawe cast himself as the school-master Dr Pym.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the main playable characters, Murfy the <b>greenbottle,</b> who first appeared in Rayman 2: The Great Escape, appears as an assist character. Murfy can perform various actions such as cutting through ropes, activating mechanisms, grabbing hold of enemies and assisting in gathering Lums. These offer a range of levels in which co-operation is required to progress. In the Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, an additional player can control Murfy directly with touch controls, using the Wii U GamePad, the Vita's front touch screen, and the Dual Shock 4 touchpad respectively. In single-player mode, control will switch over to Murfy during certain sections whilst the computer controls the player's character. In the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game, Murfy moves automatically and can be prompted to interact with certain objects with button controls. Other new features include sections where players can fire projectile fists at enemies and rhythm based levels set to covers of songs such as [...] "Black Betty", [...] "Eye of the Tiger", [...] "Woo-Hoo", and [...] "Antisocial".|$|E
5000|$|The school-master who tirelessly {{attempts}} to control his class while mayhem breaks out, Dr Percival Pym is forced to employ his cane to keep his pupils in line. His pupils, particularly Bottomly, jocularly refer to him as [...] "Percy". He is fairly gullible, allowing the boys to frequently trick him into dismissing them from class {{as well as a}} con-man to relieve him of a large sum of money in episode 227. Pym is easily side-tracked by the boys and so often loses his temper. He will generally persist with a subject with little success over several lessons before abandoning it to try a new topic in the hopes that his pupils will eventually learn something. He is known to be overweight and he is often insecure about his inadequacy as a teacher. A recurring gag is Dr Pym's (often unintentional) rudeness to policemen, Mr Snootles, and other guests to the classroom, usually due to being confused or upset by his students. In response to continual usage of the word [...] "yes" [...] by <b>Greenbottle</b> and Mr Snootles (even when they mean no), Dr Pym asks, [...] "Yes, what?", from which the show derives its name. Pym was portrayed by Rex [...] "Waca" [...] Dawe.|$|E
50|$|Bottomly is {{the class}} clown who uses {{his time in}} between classes to plan means of disrupting the next class. Despite proving himself capable of the {{workload}} {{more than a few}} times he nonetheless gives deliberately silly answers to questions Dr Pym asks. He makes continual quips and appears to have little fear of the cane. This is probably due to Bottomly having had the stick too many times for it to be adequate punishment and he considers many of his jokes worth the pain he will receive. Bottomly takes charge of lessons with his cheekiness quite often and is essentially the ringleader of the group of boys. He is quite happy to allow <b>Greenbottle</b> to be centre of attention, though, to waste more time than he could on his own. While he is not very intelligent in the traditional sense, he is very crafty; he cheats whenever he can in the tests and examinations Dr Pym gives him and such cheating usually goes unnoticed {{until the end of the}} episode. He has also contributed to the destruction of the school on two occasions, once by burning it down in a fireworks explosion. The second time, he inadvertently destroyed the classroom by switching chemical bottle labels, which Dr Pym proceeded to mix, causing an explosion that destroyed the classroom. Bottomly was played by Ralph Peterson.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The calliphorid genus Dyscritomyia is {{endemic to}} the Hawaiian Islands, and these flies provide {{another example of}} {{adaptive}} radiation within that archipelago. Dyscritomyia species have traditionally been considered members of the Tribe Luciliini, or <b>greenbottle</b> flies, although the exact systematic position of the genus has never been known. This {{is part of a}} larger problem in that the limits and systematic position of many calliphorid species are unclear, and the monophyly of the Calliphoridae itself is in dispute. As part of a larger investigation of calliphorid systematics, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of Dyscritomyia and members of the <b>greenbottle</b> genus Lucilia based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI+II) sequence data. The resulting cladogram had> 87 % bootstrap support for all branches and it recovered the Lucilia species-groups that are supported by morphological criteria. Dyscritomyia was the sister lineage to Lucilia. Therefore it is unlikely that the Hawaiian genus evolved from any Lucilia species. Although these results are preliminary it appears that COI+II sequence data will provide a strong phylogenetic signal for any future investigation of Dyscritomyia and other <b>greenbottle</b> flies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Maggot therapy {{utilizes}} freshly emerged, sterile larvae of {{the common}} <b>greenbottle</b> fly, Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata, which secrete digestive enzymes that selectively dissolve necrotic tissue, disinfect the wound, and thus stimulate wound healing. Introduction: The {{purpose of this paper}} was to review the literature in an attempt to determine the efficacy of maggot debridement therapy (MDT) of skin ulcers (e. g. diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis, osteomyelitis), with specific focus on assessing the healing time and amputation rate. Methodology: Efficacy was measured by comparing MDT to traditional treatment (i. e. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is now a}} universally {{acknowledged}} {{fact that}} maggot therapy can be used successfully to treat chronic, long-standing, infected wounds, which have previously {{failed to respond to}} conventional treatment. Such wounds are typically characterized by the presence of necrotic tissue, underlying infection and poor healing. Maggot therapy employs the use of freshly emerged, sterile larvae of the common <b>greenbottle</b> fly, Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata, and is a form of artificially induced myiasis in a controlled clinical situation. In this review article, we will discuss the role of maggots and their preparation for clinical use. Maggot therapy has the following three core beneficial effects on a wound: debridement, disinfection and enhanced healing. In part I we explore our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects...|$|E
40|$|Alternative therapies to {{conventional}} wound management are available now-a-days to facilitate faster wound healing without any complications. Among various alternative therapies, {{it has been}} well established that maggot therapy can be used successfully to treat chronic long-standing infected wounds which previously failed to respond {{to conventional}} treatment. Maggot therapy employs the use of freshly emerged, sterile larvae of the common <b>greenbottle</b> fly, Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata, and is a form of artificially induced myiasis in a controlled clinical situation. Maggot therapy, however, is used relatively little in veterinary medicine. Nevertheless, concern over antibiotic resistance and the increase in demand for organic husbandry and residue-free meat and milk, suggest that it is an option which merits further consideration. In this review article, authors’ discuss the role of maggots and their preparation for veterinary medical use...|$|E
40|$|When modern {{medicine}} fails, {{it is often}} useful to draw ideas from ancient treatments. The therapeutic use of fly larvae to debride necrotic tissue, also known as larval therapy, maggot debridement therapy or biosurgery, {{dates back to the}} beginnings of civilisation. Despite repeatedly falling out of favour largely because of patient intolerance to the treatment, the practice of larval therapy is increasing around the world because of its efficacy, safety and simplicity. Clinical indications for larval treatment are varied, but, in particular, are wounds infected with multidrug‐resistant bacteria and the presence of significant co‐morbidities precluding surgical intervention. The flies most often used in larval therapy are the facultative calliphorids, with the <b>greenbottle</b> blowfly (Lucilia sericata) being the most widely used species. This review summarises the fascinating and turbulent history of larval therapy from its origin to the present day, including mechanisms of action and evidence for its clinical applications. It also explores future research directions...|$|E
