40|$|Abstract: This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a standing wave Thermoacoustically Driven Thermoacoustic Refrigerator (TADTAR). The thermoacoustic cooler is proposed in this study as an alternative sustainable solution to current issues with vapor compression refrigerators, due to its environmentally friendlier attributes and its solar energy driven capabilities. However, {{one of the main}} hindrances to the expansion of this technology is its current lack of efficiency and performance closely related to the designing of the device. Hence, a model has been designed and constructed to perform an experimental investigation of the device’s performance at the University of Johannesburg. This model will mainly be used to investigate the dynamics of the TADTAR arrangement. The TADTAR consists of two thermoacoustic systems namely a thermoacoustic engine coupled to a thermoacoustic refrigerator. The thermoacoustic engine consists of a heat source and a cordierite <b>honeycomb</b> <b>stack</b> which converts heat into acoustic energy. The heat pumping takes place within a thermoacoustic refrigerator. Guidance on the material selection, constraints and calculation of the geometrical configuration describing the device constitute the main contribution of this wor...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional topological semimetals {{can support}} band {{crossings}} along one-dimensional curves in the momentum space (nodal lines or Dirac lines) protected by structural symmetries and topology. We consider rhombohedrally (ABC) <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices supporting Dirac lines protected by time-reversal, inversion and spin rotation symmetries. For typical band structure parameters {{there exists a}} pair of nodal lines in the momentum space extending through the whole Brillouin zone in the stacking direction. We show that these Dirac lines are topologically distinct from the usual Dirac lines which form closed loops inside the Brillouin zone. In particular, an energy gap can be opened only by first merging the Dirac lines going through the Brillouin zone in a pairwise manner so that they turn into closed loops inside the Brillouin zone, and then by shrinking these loops into points. We show {{that this kind of}} topological phase transition can occur in rhombohedrally <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices by tuning the ratio of the tunneling amplitudes in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the layers. We also discuss the properties of the surface states in the different phases of the model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{experimentally}} {{examines the}} influence of the stack geometry and position on the performance of thermo-acoustic engines (TAE). Twenty cordierite <b>honeycomb</b> ceramic <b>stacks</b> with square pores and five different lengths (7 mm, 13 mm, 17 mm, 22 mm and 25 mm) were considered. Measurements were taken at seven different locations of the stack hot ends from the pressure antinode (closed end), namely 52 mm, 72 mm, 92 mm, 112 mm, 132 mm, 152 mm and 172 mm respectively. The temperature difference across the stack and radiated sound pressure level at steady state are considered indicators of the performance of the device. The results obtained with a simple standing wave thermo-acoustic engine used in this experiment reveals that the relationships between the length, the stack pores sizes and the input power are non-linear. In addition, the effect of the viscous resistance and the thermal losses were confirmed to be strong enough when the input heating power is low...|$|R
40|$|Astronomy {{is driven}} by the quest for higher {{sensitivity}} and improved angular resolution in order to detect fainter or smaller objects. The far-infrared to submillimeter domain is a unique probe of the cold and obscured Universe, harboring for instance the precious signatures of key elements such as water. Space observations are mandatory given the blocking effect of our atmosphere. However the methods we have relied on so far to develop increasingly larger telescopes are now reaching a hard limit, with the JWST illustrating this in more than one way (e. g. it will be launched by {{one of the most powerful}} rocket, it requires the largest existing facility on Earth to be qualified). With the Thinned Aperture Light Collector (TALC) project, a concept of a deployable 20 m annular telescope, we propose to break out of this deadlock by developing novel technologies for space telescopes, which are disruptive in three aspects: &# 8226; An innovative deployable mirror whose topology, based on stacking rather than folding, leads to an optimum ratio of collecting area over volume, and creates a telescope with an eight times larger collecting area and three times higher angular resolution compared to JWST from the same pre-deployed volume; &# 8226; An ultra-light weight segmented primary mirror, based on electrodeposited Nickel, Composite and <b>Honeycomb</b> <b>stacks,</b> built with a replica process to control costs and mitigate the industrial risks; &# 8226; An active optics control layer based on piezo-electric layers incorporated into the mirror rear shell allowing control of the shape by internal stress rather than by reaction on a structure. We present in this paper the roadmap we have built to bring these three disruptive technologies to technology readiness level 3. We will achieve this goal through design and realization of representative elements: segments of mirrors for optical quality verification, active optics implemented on representative mirror stacks to characterize the shape correction capabilities, and mechanical models for validation of the deployment concept. Accompanying these developments, a strong system activity will ensure that the ultimate goal of having an integrated system can be met, especially in terms of (a) scalability toward a larger structure, and (b) verification philosophy...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in aeronautical structures. These materials can be submitted to low energy impacts like tool drop, routine operations… Such impacts can generate damages in the material that significantly reduce the structure strength. A solution to reduce the severity of damages due to impact is to add a mechanical protection on composite structures (patent n° 2 930 478). In this paper, an experimental study on different concepts of protective layers is presented. This protection is made of a certain thickness of low density energy absorbent material (foam, <b>honeycomb</b> or <b>stacking</b> of hollow spheres) and {{a thin layer of}} composite laminate (Kevlar). Experimental impact tests with a spherical impactor of 20 mm diameter at low velocity and low energy are made on aluminum plates, with different protections, and for different levels of energy. Analyses of Load/Displacement curves enable to study the capability of each mechanical protection to absorb energy. Resistance of these protections is then compared and discussed, taking into account the thickness and the surface density of the protections...|$|R

Employing a generalized mean-field approximation for arbitrary temperatures, the thermodynamic quantities (two-spin correlation functions, internal energy, magnetic susceptibility, staggered magnetization, Neel temperature, correlation length) and the spin-excitation spectrum are calculated by solving a coupled system of self-consistency equations for the correlation functions. The temperature {{dependence of the}} magnetic (uniform static) susceptibility is ascribed to antiferromagnetic short-range order. The Neel temperature is calculated for arbitrary interlayer couplings.

40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is an {{important}} cause of acute and persistent diarrhea. The defining stacked brick adherence pattern of Peruvian EAEC isolate 042 has previously been attributed to aggregative adherence fimbriae II (AAF/II), which confer aggregative adherence on laboratory E. coli strains. EAEC strains also show exceptional autoaggregation and biofilm formation, other phenotypes that have hitherto been ascribed to AAF/II. We report that EAEC 042 carries the heat-resistant agglutinin (hra 1) gene, also known as hek, which encodes an outer membrane protein. Like AAF/II, the cloned EAEC 042 hra 1 gene product is sufficient to confer autoaggregation, biofilm formation, and aggregative adherence on nonadherent and nonpathogenic laboratory E. coli strains. However, an 042 hra 1 deletion mutant is not deficient in these phenotypes compared to the wild type. EAEC strain 042 produces a classic <b>honeycomb</b> or <b>stacked</b> brick pattern of adherence to epithelial cells. Unlike wild-type 042, the hra 1 mutant typically does not form a tidy stacked brick pattern on HEp- 2 cells in culture, which is definitive for EAEC. Moreover, the hra 1 mutant is significantly impaired in the Caenorhabditis elegans slow kill colonization model. Our {{data suggest that the}} exceptional colonization of strain 042 is due to multiple factors and that Hra 1 is an accessory EAEC colonization factor...|$|R
40|$|Chiral anomaly of Weyl magnons (WMs), {{featured}} by nontrivial band crossings at paired Weyl nodes (WNs) of opposite chirality, is investigated. It {{is shown}} that WMs {{can be realized}} in <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> ferromagnets. Using the Aharonov-Casher effect that is about the interaction between magnetic moments and electric fields, the magnon motion in honeycomb layers can be quantized into magnonic Landau levels (MLLs). The zeroth MLL is chiral so that unidirectional WMs propagate in the perpendicular (to the layer) direction for a given WN under a magnetic field gradient from one WN {{to the other and}} change their chiralities, resulting in the magnonic chiral anomaly (MCA). A net magnon current carrying spin and heat through the zeroth MLL depends linearly on the magnetic field gradient and the electric field gradient in the ballistic transport.

40|$|Rotational {{misalignment}} of two <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices produces a moiré pattern that is observable in {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} as a small modulation of the apparent surface height. This is known from experiments on highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite. Here, we observe the combined effect of three-layer moiré patterns in multilayer graphene grown on SiC (0001 ̅). Small-angle rotations {{between the first and}} third layer are shown to produce a "double-moiré" pattern, resulting from the interference of moiré patterns from the first three layers. These patterns are strongly affected by relative lattice strain between the layers. We model the moiré patterns as a beat-period of the mismatched reciprocal lattice vectors and show how these patterns can be used to determine the relative strain between lattices, in analogy to strain measurement by optical moiré interferometry.

Close to the nexus the Dirac lines exhibit a transition from type I to type II lines. We consider a general model of <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices with the symmetry of Bernal (AB) stacked graphite and show that the structural mirror symmetries in such systems protect {{the presence of the}} Dirac lines, and also naturally lead to the formation of the nexus. By the bulk-boundary correspondence of topological media, the presence of Dirac lines lead to the formation of drumhead surface states at the side surfaces of the system.

The solvability {{is rooted in the}} underlying lattice structure and does not as such depend on fine-tuning, allowing us to track their evolution throughout various phases and across phase transitions. Most saliently, our models provide "boundary solvable" examples of the recently introduced higher order topological phases. We apply our general approach to breathing and anisotropic kagome and pyrochlore lattices for which we obtain exact corner eigenstates, and to periodically driven two-dimensional models as well as to truly three-dimensional pyrochlore and <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices where we present exact solutions corresponding to one-dimensional chiral states at the hinges of the lattice. We relate the higher order topological nature of these models to reflection symmetries in combination with their provenance from lower-dimensional conventional topological phases.

40|$|Graphene has {{received}} significant attention {{due to its}} excellent transport properties. Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbon (BGN), double Bernal <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> sheets of carbon which have quadratic dispersion relations instead of single layer Graphene Nanoribbon (GNR) by linear dispersion, provides an interesting area of research activity. In this paper, we show that isolating properties appears {{in the limit of}} external applied voltage in BGNs. The gap between conduction and valance band which is opened by an applied electric field is strongly varied by the value of the external voltage. The band gap is opened for Vext = 0 Vextmax to where the conduction and valance band meet each other and overlap through the conduction and valance band. In this boundary condition, BGNs are expected to behave as an insulator. In contrast, beyond this boundary condition it is estimated to be semi-metallic. Also we showed changing the value of interlayer hopping strongly affected the maximum band gap and it creates a wider possible external electric field which opens the band gap in BGNs...|$|R

40|$|Few-layer {{graphene}} systems come {{in various}} stacking orders. Considering tight-binding models for electrons on <b>stacked</b> <b>honeycomb</b> layers, this {{gives rise to}} a variety of low-energy band structures near the charge neutrality point. Depending on the stacking order these band structures enhance or reduce the role of electron-electron interactions. Here, we investigate the instabilities of interacting electrons on honeycomb multilayers with a focus on trilayers with ABA and ABC stackings theoretically by means of the functional renormalization group. We find different types of competing instabilities and identify the leading ordering tendencies in the different regions of the phase diagram for a range of local and non-local short-ranged interactions. The dominant instabilities turn out to be toward an antiferromagnetic spin-density wave (SDW), a charge density wave and toward quantum spin Hall (QSH) order. Ab-initio values for the interaction parameters put the systems at the border between SDW and QSH regimes. Furthermore, we discuss the energy scales for the interaction-induced gaps of this model study and put them into context with the scales for single-layer and Bernal-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattices. This yields a comprehensive picture of the possible interaction-induced ground states of few-layer graphene. Comment: 12 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Doctor of Technology: Mechanical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 Thermoacoustic heat engines provide a practical {{solution to the problem}} of heat management where heat can be pumped or spot cooling can be induced. This is new among emerging technology with a strong potential towards the development of sustainable and renewable energy systems by utilising solar energy or wasted heat. The most inhibiting characteristic of current thermoacoustic cooling devices is the lack of efficiency. Although simple to fabricate, the designing of thermoacoustic coolers involves significant technical challenges. The stack has been identified as the heart of the device where the heat transfer takes place. Improving its performance will make thermoacoustic technology more attractive. Existing efforts have not taken thermal losses to the surroundings into account in the derivation of the models. Although thermal losses can be neglected for large-scale applications, these losses need to be adequately covered for small-scale applications. This work explores the use of a multi-objective optimisation approach to model and to optimise the performance of a simple thermoacoustic engine. This study aims to optimise its geometrical parameters—namely the stack length, the stack height, the stack position, the number of channels and the plate spacing—involved in designing thermoacoustic engines. System parameters and constraints that capture the underlying thermoacoustic dynamics have been used to define the models. Acoustic work, viscous loss, conductive heat loss, convective heat loss and radiative heat loss have been used to measure the performance of the thermoacoustic engine. The optimisation task is formulated as a five-criterion mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Since we optimise multiple objectives simultaneously, each objective component has been given a weighting factor to provide appropriate user-defined emphasis. A practical example is provided to illustrate the approach. We have determined a design statement of a stack describing how the design would change if emphasis is placed on one objective in particular. We also considered optimisation of multiple objective components simultaneously and identified global optimal solutions describing the stack geometry using the augmented ε-constraint method. This approach has been implemented in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System). In addition, this work develops a novel mathematical programming model to optimise the performance of a simple thermoacoustic refrigerator. This study aims to optimise its geometrical parameters—namely the stack position, the stack length, the blockage ratio and the plate spacing—involved in designing thermoacoustic refrigerators. System parameters and constraints that capture the underlying thermoacoustic dynamics have been used to define the models. The cooling load, the coefficient of performance and the acoustic power loss have been used to measure the performance of the device. The optimisation task is formulated as a three-criterion nonlinear programming problem with discontinuous derivatives (DNLPs). Since we optimise multiple objectives simultaneously, each objective component has been given a weighting factor to provide appropriate user-defined emphasis. A practical example is provided to illustrate the approach. We have determined a design statement of a stack describing how the geometrical parameters described would change if emphasis is placed on one objective in particular. We also considered optimisation of multiple objective components simultaneously and identified global optimal solutions describing the stack geometry using a lexicographic multi-objective optimisation scheme. The unique feature of the present mathematical programming approach is to compute the stack geometrical parameters describing thermoacoustic refrigerators for maximum cooling or maximum coefficient of performance. The present study highlights the importance of thermal losses in the modelling of small-scale thermoacoustic engines using a multi-objective approach. The proposed modelling approach for thermoacoustic engines provides a fast estimate of the geometry and position of the stack for maximum performance of the device. The use of a lexicographic method introduced in this study improves the modelling and the computation of optimal solutions and avoids subjectivity in aggregation of weight to objective functions in the formulation of mathematical models. The unique characteristic of this research is the computing of all efficient non dominated Pareto optimal solutions allowing the decision maker to select the most efficient solution. The present research experimentally examines the influence of the stack geometry and position on the performance of thermoacoustic engines and thermoacoustic refrigerators. Thirty-six different cordierite <b>honeycomb</b> ceramic <b>stacks</b> are studied in this research. The influence of the geometry and the stack position has been investigated. The temperature difference across the stack and radiated sound pressure level at steady state are considered indicators of the performance of the devices. The general trends of the proposed mathematical programming approach results show satisfactory agreement with the experiment. One important aspect revealed by this study is that geometrical parameters are interdependent and can be treated as such when optimising the device to achieve its highest performance. The outcome of this research has direct application in the search for efficient stack configurations of small-scale thermoacoustic devices for electronics cooling...|$|R
