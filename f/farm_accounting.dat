40|$|There is a {{need for}} valid and {{representative}} data on the production,resourceuse and emissions from different farm types in Denmark for publicregulation and assessment. The data should be usable for both area-based environmental assessment(e. g. nitrate leaching per ha) and product oriented environmental assessment(e. g. greenhouse gas emissions per kg pork). The objective {{of this study was to}} establish a national agricultural model for estimating data on resource use, production and environmentally important emissions for aset of representative farmtypes. Every year a sample of <b>farm</b> <b>accounts</b> is established in order to report Danish agro-economical data to the ‘Farm Accountancy Data Network’ (FADN), and to produce ‘The annual Danish account statistics for agriculture’. The <b>farm</b> <b>accounts</b> are selected and weighted to be representative for the Danish agricultural sector, and similar samples of <b>farm</b> <b>accounts</b> are collected in most of the European countries. Based on a sample of 2138 <b>farm</b> <b>accounts</b> from year 1999 a national agricultural model, consisting of 31 farm types, was constructed. The <b>farm</b> <b>accounts</b> were grouped according to the major soil types, the number of working hours, the most important enterprise (dairy, pig, different cash crops), livestock density, etc. For each group the <b>farm</b> <b>account</b> data on the average resource use, products sold, land use and herd structure were used to establish a farm type with coherency between livestock production, feeduse, landuse, yields, imported feed,homegrown feed, manure production, fertilizer use and crop production. The set of farm types was scaled up to national level thus representing the whole Danish agricultural sector and the resulting production, resource use and land use was checked against the national statistics. Nutrient balance methodology and state-of-the-art emission models and factors were used to establish the emissions of nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, nitrousoxide, methane and fossil carbon dioxide from each farm type. In this paper data on resource uses and emissions from selected farm types are presented and it is demonstrated that this approach can lead to an agro-environmental inventory, which is consistent with national level estimates and still has the advantage of being disaggregated to specific farm types. Conventional dairy farm types in general emitted more nitrate but less phosphate compared with pig farm types. The methane emission was higher from dairy farm types compared with all other farm types. In general the conventional dairy farms emitted more nitrate, ammonia, and nitrous oxide, compared with organic dairy farms. ...|$|R

Therefore {{it makes sense to}} bring together the 'change agents', the persons who have a personal drive to change the content of their work and their organisations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of investment in sensor systems on productivity change, using <b>farm</b> <b>accounting</b> data. <b>Farm</b> <b>accounting</b> data for the years 2008 – 2013 was available for 217 Dutch dairy farms. In addition, information was available on the adoption of sensor systems on these farms. For each farm, 5 input variables (number of dairy cows, number of hectares, total capital costs, total variable costs, and total labor costs) and 1 output variable (total revenues) were defined for each year. The Malmquist Total Factor Productivity index was used to examine productivity change for three categories of farms: farms without sensor systems, farms with sensor systems at an automatic milking system, and farms with sensor systems at a conventional milking system. The Malmquist index measures how the productivity of an individual farm changes over time and enables the contributions of technical change and technical efficiency change to be identified. Productivity did not change after investment in sensor systems on dairy farms. Furthermore, no technical change was found after investment in sensor systems, suggesting that the potential technological improvement claimed by producers of sensor systems does not materialize on dairy farms. Providing more information and guidance on how to use the output of sensor systems might improve the technical performance of the farms...|$|E
40|$|This rst part {{gives the}} main {{concepts}} for estimating a nested multi-input and multi-output cost function, preparing <b>farm</b> <b>accounting</b> data into {{input and output}} categories at dierent levels of aggregation and proceeding to the econometric estimation. These concepts will be implemented in the following parts of this project. With respect to previous work in that empirical domain, in particular the work as reported in Henry de Frahan et al. (2011) and De Blander et al. (2011), this work adds the original feature of introducing and implementing a cost function that is nested in an upper and {{a lower level of}} both input and output categories that allows to consider a wider range of input and output categories that is generally not considered in the available empirical literature on cost functions. The authors are not aware of previous development of a nested cost function in the literature while the concept of nested functions is widely used for production and utility functions. With respect to this previous work, this work also calculates dierently land and non-land capital inputs, using a better estimate of the opportunity cost of capital as suggested in Andersen et al.
