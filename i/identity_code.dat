40|$|The face {{perception}} system {{is comprised of}} a network of connected regions including the middle fusiform gyrus (“fusiform face area” or FFA), the inferior occipital gyrus (“occipital face area” or OFA), and the posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus. These regions are typically active bilaterally but may show right hemisphere dominance. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response of the right FFA is normally attenuated for face stimuli of the same compared to different identities, called fMR-adaptation. The recovery in fMRI signal, or release from fMR-adaptation, for faces of different identities indicates that the neural population comprising the FFA is involved in <b>coding</b> face <b>identity.</b> Patients with prosopagnosia who are unable to visually recognize faces and who show right OFA damage, nonetheless show face-selective activation in the right FFA (Rossion et al., 2003; Steeves et al., 2006). However, the sensitivity to face identity is abnormal in the right FFA and does not show the typical release from adaptation for different face identities (Steeves et al., 2009). This indicates that in these patients the FFA is not differentiating face identity and suggests that an intact right OFA is integral for face <b>identity</b> <b>coding.</b> We used offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt processing in the right OFA in healthy subjects. We then immediately performed fMRI to measure changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal across the face network using a face fMR-adaptation paradigm. We hypothesized that TMS to the right OFA would induce abnormal face <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in the right FFA, reflected by a decreased adaptation response. Indeed, activation for different but not same identity faces in the right FFA decreased after TMS was applied to the right OFA compared to sham TMS and TMS to a control site, the nearby object-selective right lateral occipital area (LO). Our findings indicate that TMS to the OFA selectively disrupts face but not butterfly <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in both the OFA and FFA. Congruent with mounting evidence from both patients and healthy subjects, here we causally demonstrate the importance of the often-overlooked OFA for normal face <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in the FFA...|$|R

30|$|For this study, we {{designed}} a QR <b>Code</b> <b>Identity</b> Tag system to integrate into the Turkish healthcare system. This system provides QR code-based medical identification alerts and an in-hospital patient identification system. Every {{member of the}} medical system is assigned a unique QR Code Tag; to facilitate medical identification alerts, the QR <b>Code</b> <b>Identity</b> Tag can be worn as a bracelet or necklace or carried as an ID card. Patients must always possess the QR <b>Code</b> <b>Identity</b> bracelets within hospital grounds. These QR code bracelets link to the QR <b>Code</b> <b>Identity</b> website, where detailed information is stored; a smartphone or standalone QR code scanner {{can be used to}} scan the code. The design of this system allows authorized personnel (e.g., paramedics, firefighters, or police) to access more detailed patient information than the average smartphone user: emergency service professionals are authorized to access patient medical histories to improve the accuracy of medical treatment. In Istanbul, we tested the self-designed system with 174 participants. To analyze the QR <b>Code</b> <b>Identity</b> Tag system’s usability, the participants completed the System Usability Scale questionnaire after using the system.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} possible differences between genders in amputation incidence, revascularization activity before and survival after amputation. This population-based study was carried out in a well-defined geographical area, where all vascular surgical consultations and reconstructions are performed in one university hospital. All amputations performed in the region during 1990 – 1999 were identified from the hospital central registers. According to patient’s <b>identity</b> <b>codes,</b> the Cause of Death Registry of Statistics Finland provided death data. Amputation data were cross-linked with the local vascular registry using <b>identity</b> <b>codes.</b> Women were found to be 8 years older than men (p 5 0. 0001). Major amputations comprised 73. 4 % in males and 77. 7 % in females. The age-standardized amputation incidence among males was 338 and among females 226 (per 106 inhabitants/year) (p 5 0. 001). The most prominent difference was seen in amputations due to trauma, where the age-adjusted major amputation incidence was over three-fold among males compared to females. The proportion of patients who had undergone vascular procedure before amputation was 23 % in both genders. Median survival after amputation was 943 days in men and 716 in women (p 0. 01). When the higher age of women was considered, there was no significant difference between the genders. Survival was poorer amon...|$|R
