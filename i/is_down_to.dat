25|$|The Philippine {{government}} has recently opened up their public policy to promote women working abroad since the world's demand for domestic workers and healthcare workers has increased.

Nurse to patient ratio <b>is</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 1 nurse to between 40 and 60 patients, in the 1990s the ratio was 1 nurse to between 15 and 20 patients.
