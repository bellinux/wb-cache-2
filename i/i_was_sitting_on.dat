2500|$|One {{afternoon}} at sunset <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> my golden hilltop, rejoicing that British women {{had just been}} enfranchised and American women would soon be politically free ... when suddenly, as in a vision, I saw {{that out of the}} hideous world war might come as a glorious aftermath international industrial justice and international peace...I also saw as part of my vision that the coming of equal opportunity for the manual workers of the world might be hastened by utilizing the deep sex sympathy that women now feel for each other before it has had time to grow less.|$|E
2500|$|Noel Murray at The Onion's The A. V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{qualified}} approval with a B rating. [...] According to Murray, [...] "The serial killer stuff in 'Inner Child was fairly pat—with elements swiped wholesale from Thomas Harris and Michael Connelly—and the 'keep Lil’ O away from Eliot' operation {{struck me as}} a little sloppy, if not actively implausible. But the episode was fast paced and creepy, with a few good Walter lines (my favorite being a tie between 'Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like' and 'obviously <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the toilet') and the return of his wonderfully ridiculous mad scientist device, 'the neural stimulator.'" ...|$|E

60|$|All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{something}} hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift {{it out of}} that. Wait for an opportunity.|$|R
60|$|Here {{follows a}} {{dialogue}} (but it requires imitation), which I had yesterday {{morning with a}} little boy of the house--landlord's son, I suppose--about Plorn's age. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the sofa writing, and find him sitting beside me.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{the front}} {{doorstep}} {{after they had}} gone when Johnny came around the corner, looking so mysterious and determined that I knew he had thought of something splendid.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a man}} 'ere 'arf an {{hour ago}} that {{reminded}} me of both of these faults. He came in a-purpose to remind me, and 'e brought a couple o' grinning, brass-faced monkeys with 'im to see 'im do it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> that barrel when he came, and arter two minutes I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> red-'ot cinders. He purtended he 'ad come in for the sake of old times and to ask arter my 'ealth, and all the time he was doing 'is best to upset me to amuse them two pore objecks 'e 'ad brought with 'im.|$|E
60|$|Well, well! Dora and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} by and by, quiet enough, and Jip {{was lying in}} her lap, winking peacefully at me. It was off my mind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in a state of}} perfect rapture. Dora and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> engaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would be proper not to {{understand}} your civility?--But that is not my way--I don't make a courtesy for it because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> horseback. But, seriously, I deserve your exception, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only conversable being about the Hall, except the old priest and Rashleigh." ...|$|R
60|$|I can see {{the picture}} plainly still. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a low chair before the nursery fire, one knee {{supported}} in my locked hands, meanwhile Mrs. Fursey's needle grated with monotonous regularity against her thimble. At that moment knocked at my small soul {{for the first time}} the problem of life.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the top bar of {{the corral}} fence and before me stood three saddled horses that would have gladdened any eye. I was waiting to take the young ladies on their usual morning ride.|$|E
6000|$|... "My wife's brother," [...] Ridley {{explained}} to Hilda, whom {{he failed to}} remember, [...] "has a house here, which he has lent us. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a rock thinking of nothing at all when Elliot started up like a fairy in a pantomime." ...|$|E
60|$|They didn't {{find the}} body, and I was a'most forgetting about Sam when one evening, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a box {{waiting to get}} my breath back to 'ave another go at sweeping, Joe Peel, Sam's mate, came on to the wharf to see me.|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{the tram}} number 10 in Helsinki city. It is a windy and cold spring day. In front of me, two ladies {{are having an}} {{intensive}} discussion. I can see their concentrated facial expressions. As an echo I hear fragments of their chat [...] . “ [...] . Have you seen the beggars in the city centre? There {{are so many of}} them [...] . ” “I heard that they are from Romania…Romanian Gypsies. But I cannot understand why are they coming here? Why doesn’t Romania take them back? ( [...] .)

60|$|About dusk {{one evening}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the little gallery {{in front of}} the Hinkle parlor, waiting for Ileen to come, when I heard voices inside. She had come into the room with her father, and Old Man Hinkle began to talk to her. I had {{observed}} before that he was a shrewd man, and not unphilosophic.|$|E
60|$|They left my dear girl {{still sitting}} at the piano and me still sitting beside her. When they were gone out, I drew my arm round her waist. She put her left hand in mine (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> that side), but kept her right upon the keys, going over and over them without {{striking}} any note.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is the way}} it was. I {{had just}} got on my shoes and pants and shirt, and had started {{to get out of the}} bunk. There <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the edge of the bunk, my legs {{dangling}} down, when the locomotives came together. The berths, upper and lower, on the opposite side had already been made up by the porter.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} three weeks after this, and Euphemia and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> our front steps,--I had come home early, and we had been potting some of the tenderest plants,--when Pomona walked in at the gate. She looked well, and had on a very bright new dress. Euphemia noticed this the moment she came in. We welcomed her warmly, for we felt a great {{interest}} in this girl, who had grown up in our family and under our care.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unfortunately," [...] said Mrs. Archibald, [...] "I cannot do that {{exactly as}} I would like to. If {{we had not}} promised my {{daughter}} and her husband that we would stay away for a month, I should go directly home and superintend my jelly-making and fruit-preserving; but as I cannot do that, I have determined to act out my own self here. I shall darn stockings and sew or read, {{and try to make}} myself comfortable and happy, just as I would if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> my broad piazza, at home." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{see that}} old felled tree there. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> it {{the day before}} {{yesterday}} and thinking of you. Will you come there and sit with me on it? When you sit on it you get a view, oh! a perfectly lovely English view, just a bit of the house and those clumps of trees and the valley away there with the lily pond. I'd love to have you in my memory of it...." ...|$|E
60|$|After my {{talk with}} McCann <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the {{forecastle}} {{propped against the}} bitts of the Maria's anchor-chain, {{and looking at the}} swirling foam cast up by the tug's propeller. There were many things I wished to turn over in my mind just then, but I had not long been in a state of reverie when I became conscious that Miss Thorn was standing beside me. I got to my feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the bank, conjuring up {{this scene}} to myself, when George remarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps I would not mind helping to wash up; and, thus {{recalled}} {{from the days}} of the glorious past to the prosaic present, with all its misery and sin, I slid down into the boat and cleaned out the frying-pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass, polishing it up finally with George’s wet shirt.|$|E
6000|$|Great restorer of antiquity, great enchanter. In a mild night, {{when the}} harvest or hunter's moon shines unobstructedly, {{the houses in}} our village, {{whatever}} architect {{they may have had}} by day, acknowledge only a master. The village street is then as wild as the forest. New and old things <b>are</b> confounded. <b>I</b> know not whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the ruins of a wall, or on the material which is to compose a new one. Nature is an instructed and impartial teacher, spreading no crude opinions, and flattering none; she will be neither radical nor conservative. Consider the moonlight, so civil, yet so savage! ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{used with}} forms of be, in {{progressive}} (continuous) constructions: He is writing another book; <b>I</b> intend to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the beach.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{the deck}} of a Savannah steam-ship, which was lying at a dock in the East River, New York. I was waiting for young Rectus, and had already waited some time; which {{surprised}} me, because Rectus was, as a general thing, a very prompt fellow, who seldom kept people waiting. But it was probably impossible for him to regulate his own movements this time, for his father and mother were coming with him, to see him off.|$|E
6000|$|When, {{a little}} later, R.C. came panting down stream <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the bank, all wet, with one knee skinned and I {{was holding his}} broken leader in my hands. Strange to say, he went into a rage! Blamed me {{for the loss of}} that big trout! Under such {{circumstances}} it was always best to maintain silence and I did so as long as I could. After his paroxysm had spent itself and he had become somewhat near a rational being once more he asked me: ...|$|E
6000|$|A chest, also {{singularly}} grained and streaked, of {{two large}} {{and two small}} drawers, held Parload's reserve of garments, and pegs on the door carried his two hats and completed this inventory of a [...] "bed-sitting-room" [...] as I knew it before the Change. But I had forgotten--there was also a chair with a [...] "squab" [...] that apologized inadequately for the defects of its cane seat. I forgot that for the moment because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the chair on the occasion that best begins this story.|$|E
60|$|Friday.--Colvin and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{a seat on}} the battlemented {{gardens of}} Old Monaco. The day is grey and clouded, with a little red light on the horizon, and the sea, {{hundreds}} of feet below us, is a sort of purple dove-colour. Shrub-geraniums, firs, and aloes cover all available shelves and terraces, and where these become impossible, the prickly pear precipitates headlong downwards its bunches of oval plates; so that the whole face of the cliff is covered with an arrested fall (please excuse clumsy language), a sort of fall of the evil angels petrified midway on its career. White gulls sail past below us every now and then, sometimes singly, sometimes by twos and threes, and sometimes in a great flight. The sharp perfume of the shrub-geraniums fills the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what fun!" [...] he cried. [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on?</b> Is {{this your}} room? How jolly!" [...] "There--sit there," [...] she commanded. Cowper slid once more.|$|R
60|$|The clerks were there, {{but nobody}} was doing anything. Old Tiffey, {{for the first}} time in his life <b>I</b> should think, <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> {{somebody}} else's stool, and had not hung up his hat.|$|R
