5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} <b>its</b> <b>not</b> allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E
5|$|Before 1846, Gray {{had been}} firmly {{opposed to the}} idea of {{transmutation}} of species, in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the basic unit of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation of species among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species, that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin's theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of <b>its</b> <b>not</b> allowing for evolution.|$|E

25|$|Although the Emperor was {{initially}} enthusiastic, {{he refused to}} provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists, and the venture eventually proved impossible to realise. Bolts’s hopes for a commercial voyage and {{the desire of the}} Emperor and his naturalists for a voyage of scientific discovery were incompatible as a combined undertaking. The opposition of Bolts’s Belgian former financial partners and now rivals in the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp was also a cause of <b>its</b> <b>not</b> going ahead, and in the autumn of 1782 it was abandoned. Instead of sending out a scientific expedition on an Austrian ship as Born had proposed, the Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter went from Le Havre in April 1783 on the American frigate General Washington (Captain Joshua Barney) to Philadelphia and thence to South Carolina, Florida, the Bahamas and Santo Domingo (Hispaniola). Besides plants, they were to collect animal and mineral specimens. Reflecting the origins of the enterprise, their instructions gave them the option (which was not taken up) to take ship from Acapulco in Mexico to the Philippines, thence to the Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies, the coasts of Bengal, Coromandel and Malabar, and the Iles de France and Bourbon (Mauritius and Reunion).|$|E

500|$|In the now-notorious Salem Witch Trials, Stoughton {{acted as}} both chief judge and prosecutor. He was {{particularly}} harsh {{on some of}} the defendants, sending the jury deliberating in the case of Rebecca Nurse back to reconsider <b>its</b> <b>not</b> guilty verdict; after doing so, she was convicted. [...] Many convictions were made because Stoughton permitted the use of spectral evidence, the idea that a demonic vision could only take on the shape or appearance of someone who had made some sort of devilish pact or engaged in witchcraft. Although Cotton Mather argued that this type of evidence was acceptable when making accusations, some judges expressed reservations about its use in judicial proceedings. Stoughton, however, was convinced of its acceptability, and may have influenced other judges to this view. The special court stopped sitting in September 1692.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{tells of the}} protagonist's devotion to her lover, proclaiming that while she knows [...] "you've got me", she'll be [...] "lovin' him long time". The first verse begins with [...] "You ain't even got to worry / About a thing, I've got you babe / And ain't nobody takin' me away / <b>Its</b> <b>not</b> a game I'm here to stay", {{describing}} her strong emotional attachment to him. As the verse continues, Carey makes references and comparisons to their love and drugs powerful effect over the body and its senses. Carey describes the limits of her love during the chorus, singing [...] "As long as I can breathe" [...] and [...] "Eternally". During the second verse, she sings how no matter what others say about their relationship, they will continue being together, and describing a private moment they shared, their [...] "Little spot where no one knows".|$|E
500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. <b>Its</b> <b>not</b> real joy yet until we know how to love the people that are around us".|$|E

500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of <b>its</b> <b>not</b> being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Climb" [...] won [...] "Best Song from a Movie" [...] at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards and [...] "Music Choice: Single" [...] at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, [...] "The Climb" [...] {{received}} a nomination for the Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, a songwriter's award. However, Walt Disney Records withdrew the song from consideration because {{the song was}} not [...] "written specifically for a motion picture, television or other visual media", as the Grammy eligibility rules dictated. According to Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "The Climb" [...] was submitted for consideration by mistake. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the presenters of the Grammy Awards, released a statement stating, [...] "Walt Disney Records was proactive and forthcoming to our awards department and verified that the song was not written specifically for the film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Based on this information, the Academy has complied with the label's request." [...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest initial vote count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film Where the Wild Things Are. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: <b>Its</b> <b>not</b> about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is easy when you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because [...] "she’s a pretty good singer for someone her age".|$|E
