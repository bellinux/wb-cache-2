40|$|SummaryCD 4 T {{helper cells}} {{play a central}} role in the control of {{infection}} by intracellular parasites. How efficiently pathogen-specific CD 4 T cells detect <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo is unclear. Here, we employed intravital two-photon imaging to examine the behavior of pathogen-specific CD 4 T cells at the site of Leishmania major infection. While activated CD 4 T cells enter the inflamed tissue irrespective of their antigen specificity, pathogen-specific T cells preferentially decelerated and accumulated in infected regions of the dermis. Antigen recognition by CD 4 T cells was heterogeneous, involving both stable and dynamic contacts with infected phagocytes. However, not all <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> induced arrest or deceleration of pathogen-specific T cells, and dense clusters of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> were poorly accessible to migrating T cells.

5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the <b>infected</b> <b>cell,</b> which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of {{independent}} particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{have two}} main immune responses—the hypersensitive response, in which <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> seal {{themselves}} off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> release signals warning {{the rest of}} the plant of a pathogen's presence.|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex {{virus strain}} MPdk− multiplies in HEp- 2 cells, {{but not in}} dog kidney (DK) cells. Strain MPdk+sp, a multistep mutant of MPdk−, multiplies in both HEp- 2 and DK cells. Stabilized lysates of productively <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> yield three {{macromolecular}} aggregates of viral deoxyribonucleic acid and protein banding in CsCl gradients at densities of 1. 285 g/cm 3 (α), 1. 325 g/cm 3 (β), and 1. 37 to 1. 45 g/cm 3 (γ). Similar lysates from abortively <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> yield only the β and γ bands. Electron microscopic examination revealed that (i) the α band contained enveloped nucleocapsids, whereas the β band contained naked nucleocapsids and particles tentatively identified as internal components of the nucleocapsids, and that (ii) the enveloped virions and reduplication of cellular membranes observed in thin sections of productively <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> were absent from abortively <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> Studies of the surface antigens of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> in a cytolytic system described previously revealed that abortively <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> contained approximately 10 -fold less virus-induced surface antigen than did productively <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> From these and other data published previously, we concluded that infectious MPdk− virions are not made in DK cells because (i) functional viral products necessary for the envelopment of the nucleocapsid are not made, and (ii) capsid proteins and some nonstructural products specified by the virus malfunction...|$|R
5|$|HIV <b>infects</b> vital <b>cells</b> in {{the human}} immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively <b>infected</b> T <b>cells,</b> apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of <b>infected</b> <b>cells,</b> and killing of <b>infected</b> CD4+ T <b>cells</b> by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|R

25|$|The E5 are small, very {{hydrophobic}} {{proteins that}} destabilise {{the function of}} many membrane proteins in the <b>infected</b> <b>cell.</b> The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have {{also been shown to}} down-regulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, which may prevent the <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> from being eliminated by killer T cells.|$|E
40|$|Glycoprotein GVP- 11 (molecular weight, 71, 500), {{induced by}} bovine {{herpesvirus}} type 1, was detected on the external surface of <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> It could {{be categorized as}} an "early" or "beta" class protein since it was synthesized early in the infectious process and its expression was not dependent upon prior viral DNA replication in the <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> Monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP- 11 immunoprecipitated that glycoprotein and some low-molecular-weight polypeptides from <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> labeled with either [35 S]methionine or [3 H]glucosamine.

Tunicamycin-sensitive glycosylation appeared to be necessary {{for the expression of}} the glycoproteins {{on the surface of the}} <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> The monoclonal antibodies directed against GVP- 11 and serum from an immune cow could participate in antibody- and complement-mediated immunocytolysis of <b>infected</b> <b>cells,</b> and this immunocytolysis could be enhanced by arresting cells in the early phase of viral gene expression by treatment with inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis...|$|R

In a nonimmune individual, serum antibody reactivity to surface antigens of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> was acquired during convalescence, as tested by all five methods, and was generally parasite isolate-specific. By contrast, adult hyperimmune West African sera reacted with many isolates, including isolates from geographically distinct regions. A quantitative correlation was established between agglutination and surface immunofluorescence assay titers, and between surface immunofluorescence assay and immunoEM reactivity, suggesting that a single antigen or a set of coexpressed antigens is being detected. Surface iodination of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> identified trypsin-sensitive high M, antigens in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extract. All sera tested that agglutinated <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> also immunoprecipitated these antigens. The same surface antigens were immunoprecipitated by the homologous convalescent serum as by adult sera. By immunoEM these antigens were localized exclusively at the knob-like protrusions of <b>infected</b> <b>cells,</b> where they may participate in adherence to vascular endothelium...|$|R

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that, as the virus infects human cells, host homeostatic processes like autophagy and ER stress response, {{not to mention}} apoptosis, are triggered depending on the <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> type.

25|$|AZT is a {{thymidine}} analogue. AZT {{works by}} selectively inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme {{that the virus}} uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA.

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) spreads {{primarily}} by cell-to-cell transmission. Therefore, HTLV- 1 promotes {{the proliferation of}} <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> to facilitate transmission. In HTLV- 1 infected individuals, the provirus is present mainly in effector/memory T cells and Foxp 3 + T cells. Recent study suggests that this immunophenotype is acquired by <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> through the function of HTLV- 1 bZIP factor (HBZ). Tax, which is encoded by the plus strand, is crucial for viral replication and de novo infection, while HBZ, encoded by the minus strand, is important for proliferation of <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> Importantly, HBZ and Tax have opposing functions in most transcription pathways.

40|$|International audienceHIV {{establishes}} reservoirs of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> that persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). In most patients, {{the virus}} begins to replicate soon after treatment interruption. However, a low frequency of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> {{at the time}} of treatment interruption has been associated with delayed viral rebound. Likewise, individuals who control the infection spontaneously, so-called HIV- 1 controllers (HICs), carry particularly low levels of <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> It is unclear, however, whether and how this small number of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> contributes to durable viral control. Here we compared 38 HICs with 12 patients on effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and found that the low frequency of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> in the former subjects was associated both with less efficient viral reactivation in resting CD 4 + T cells and with less efficient virion production ex vivo. We also found that a potent HIV-specific CD 8 + T cell response was present only in those HICs whose CD 4 + T cells produced virus ex vivo. Long-term spontaneous control of HIV infection in HICs thus appears to be sustained {{on the basis of the}} inefficient reactivation of viruses from a limited number of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> and the capacity of HICs to activate a potent HIV-specific CD 8 + T cell response to counteract efficient viral reactivation events...|$|R
25|$|Multiplicity {{reactivation}} (MR) is {{the process}} by which viral genomes containing inactivating damage interact within an <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> to form a viable viral genome.

25|$|The early {{genes are}} {{responsible}} for expressing mainly non-structural, regulatory proteins.

Our objective was to develop Raman spectroscopy for characterizing the chemical composition of fixed <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> We found the intensity of Raman spectra for the inclusion {{is much greater than}} the nucleus which has a greater intensity than the cytosol. Comparing the upward-going and the negative-going peaks of nucleus spectrum minus intensified cytoplasm spectrum, there are more amino acids (specifically adenine) and ATP present in the nucleus and there is more RNA in the cytosol. In addition, inclusion minus intensified cytoplasm shows more fatty acids and adenine in the inclusion, whereas the cytosol contains more RNA. By gathering Raman spectra of inclusion, nucleus, and cytoplasm, we measured and analyzed the concentration of manipulated metabolites, such as ATP, pre and post Chlamydia <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus Raman microscopy {{is one of the few}} non-invasive methods to investigate chlamydia <b>infected</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

25|$|Cell {{suicide is}} an {{effective}} means of stemming the spread of a pathogen throughout an organism. In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express caspase inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass caspase activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.|$|E
25|$|Caspases {{have other}} {{identified}} roles in {{programmed cell death}} such as pyroptosis and necroptosis.

Caspases also {{have a role in}} inflammation, whereby it directly processes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL1β. These are signalling molecules that allow recruitment of immune cells to an <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> or tissue. There are other identified roles of caspases such as cell proliferation, tumour suppression, cell differentiation, neural development and axon guidance and ageing.|$|E

Infection by the Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to cause production of a SAg in infected cells, yet no gene for the toxin has been found on the genome of the virus. The virus manipulates the <b>infected</b> <b>cell</b> to express its own SAg genes, and this helps it to evade the host immune system. Similar results have been found with rabies, cytomegalovirus, and HIV.|$|E

40|$|Two virus {{infection}} {{models with}} antibody immune response and chronically <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> are proposed and analyzed. Bilinear incidence rate is {{considered in the}} first model, while the incidence rate is given by a saturated functional response in the second one. One main feature of these models is that it includes both short-lived <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> and chronically <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> The chronically <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> produce much smaller amounts of virus than the short-lived <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> and die at a much slower rate. Our mathematical analysis establishes that the global dynamics of the two models are determined by two threshold parameters R 0 and R 1. By constructing Lyapunov functions and using LaSalle's invariance principle, we have established the global asymptotic stability of all steady states of the models. We have proven that, the uninfected steady state is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) if R 0 < 1, the infected steady state without antibody immune response exists and it is GAS if R 1 1.

The mechanism(s) of evasion is not completely defined but has been suggested to include resistance of <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> to CTL-mediated apoptosis. The HIV- 1 Vpr protein induces G 2 arrest by indirectly inhibiting activation of cyclin B/p 34 cdc 2 kinase. Granzyme B, the principle mediator of CTL-induced apoptosis, prematurely activates this same kinase complex. Therefore, we assessed the susceptibility of HIV- 1 <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> to CTL-mediated apoptosis {{to determine whether the}} expression of Vpr protected the <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> from CTL-induced apoptosis. Antigen-specific CD 8 + CTL were able to induce apoptosis in HIV- 1 <b>infected</b> <b>cells</b> and cells labeled with peptide corresponding to the CTL epitope with equivalent efficiency. This demonstrates that neither HIV- 1 Vpr nor any other HIV protein directly inhibits CTL effector functions. Furthermore, we confirm that HIV- 1 Nef is able to provide partial protection from CTL recognition of <b>infected</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, the inability of CTL to control HIV- 1 infection is likely not due to direct inhibition of CTL-mediated apoptosis...|$|R
