40|$|The {{concept of}} "enabling {{conditions}}" centers on conditions that facilitate approaches to addressing social and ecological challenges. Although multiple fields have independently addressed {{the concept of}} <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions,</b> the literature lacks a shared understanding or integration of concepts. We propose a more synthesized understanding of <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> beyond disciplinary boundaries {{by focusing on the}} <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> that influence the implementation of a range of environmental policies termed payments for ecosystem services (PES). Through an analysis of key literature from different disciplinary perspectives, we examined how researchers and practitioners refer to and identify <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> within the context of PES. Through our synthesis, we identified 24 distinct <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> organized within 4 broad themes: biophysical, economic, governance, and social-cultural conditions. We found that the literature coalesces around certain <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as strong ecosystem science and existing institutions, regardless of disciplinary background or journal audience. We also observed key differences in how authors perceive the direction of influence for property type, program objectives, and number of actors. Additionally, we noted an emphasis on the importance of the contextual nature of many <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> that may cause certain conditions to have a disproportionate impact on successful implementation in some circumstances. Unraveling the relative importance of specific <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> in diverse contexts remains a research frontier. Ultimately, no single disciplinary perspective is likely to provide all necessary insights for PES creation, and given the intertwined nature of <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions,</b> practitioners need to consider insights from multiple dimensions.

A framework is developed for application of the different types of analysis in terms of two dimensions; planned versus emergent systems and prescriptive versus descriptive modes of research. It is shown how the different types of analysis can be used in each cell of the framework.

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} quest for synergy between {{mitigation}} and adaptation due to concerns of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the compartmentalized approaches to climate change. However, little {{has been done to}} explore the necessary <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> for synergistic design and implementation. This paper proposes an analytical framework to assess <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> for synergies at the national level and applies it to developing countries to explore the potential move toward synergy. Four <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> for integrating adaptation and mitigation, i. e. policies and strategies, programs and projects, institutional arrangements and financial mechanisms, were used to score developing countries relative to each other. We hypothesized that low income and vulnerable countries might more likely pursue synergy given the urgency for both adaptation and mitigation. Despite the relative infancy of the synergy concept, about half of countries studied exhibited good synergy potential, 80 % of which were middle-income developing countries. The assumption of vulnerability as a precursor for pursuing synergy was supported by the fact that small island states possessed relatively high synergy potential. Income was weakly associated with the synergy potential with least developed countries having low synergy scores. Emerging economies possessed strong synergy potential which might be associated with better capacity available and/or potential for shaping their global images due to their growing emissions. In sum, the proposed analytical framework could be useful to identify areas of emphasis to promote holistic and efficient climate policies. As this study largely focused on the <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions,</b> further studies are needed to scrutinize and manage the mitigation-adaptation balances in countries possessing good synergy potentials...|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{tourism is}} {{potentially}} a {{common pool resource}} (CPR) issue when the following are applicable: {{it is difficult to}} exclude tourists; their experiences are affected by others' activities; and adverse impacts on the wildlife occur. CPRs are typified by non-excludability and subtractability. Relatively few efforts have been made to consider tourism in this way or to use the concept of CPR in tourism management schemes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} {{participating}} in a pressure ulcer prevalence survey and receiving feedback results in an improvement in quality of care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional studies from 1998 to 2002 were compared over time. SETTING: Sixty-two acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized {{at the moment of}} the surveys. INTERVENTIONS: Each hospital was given hospital-specific performance data and national aggregate data, and peer comparisons {{to improve the quality of}} care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The case-mix-adjusted prevalence of pressure ulcers of grade >or= 2, the percentage of high-risk patients receiving adequate prevention, and the total number of <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> present were compared between successive surveys using multi-level analysis, in order to estimate a linear trend model and trend differences for each hospital. RESULTS: The case-mix-adjusted prevalence of pressure ulcers decreased over the 5 -year period, while the percentage of patients receiving adequate prevention and the total number of <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> present increased. The total number of <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> had a significant effect on the decrease in case-mix-adjusted prevalence: more <b>enabling</b> <b>conditions</b> led to a lower case-mix-adjusted prevalence (chi(2) = 125; degrees of freedom = 1; P < 0. 00). The percentage of patients receiving adequate prevention also had an effect on the change in case-mix-adjusted prevalence, with a higher percentage leading to a lower case-mix-adjusted prevalence. This effect, however, was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring prevalence and giving feedback results in an improvement in quality of care in terms of pressure ulcer prevention. It is very important to continue conducting surveys to avoid attention moving away from this topic, which may in turn lead to a deterioration in the quality of pressure ulcer care.
