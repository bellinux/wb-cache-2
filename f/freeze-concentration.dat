40|$|Several {{treatments}} on ice blocks can {{be applied}} during block <b>freeze-concentration</b> to increase the solute recovery from the ice. In the present study, {{the changes in the}} ice block’s temperature and the application of annealing during the block <b>freeze-concentration</b> of aqueous coffee extracts were studied. The ice block was subjected to heating and annealing prior to the thawing stage. The effect of coolant temperature during ice block heating (T = - 10 and - 5 °C) and the application of annealing (+, -) on solute recovery and ice structure morphology was evaluated. The use of annealing during block <b>freeze-concentration</b> modified the ice crystal morphology and increased the solute recovery only when it is applied at the highest temperature. In general, the annealing process increased the size and circularity of the ice crystals, consequently improving the solute recovery. Thus, annealing can be used to increase the solute recovery during block <b>freeze-concentration.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Coffee extract was freeze-concentrated through {{block and}} falling-film techniques. Solute {{retention}} and concentration efficiency were determined after one stage of these processes. Ice morphology was characterized through image analysis. Preservation of volatile compounds was determined through GC–MS. The effect of coffee extract on flavour was determined after freeze concentration through sensory evaluation. Solute occlusion was higher for falling-film than for block <b>freeze-concentration,</b> {{with an average}} distribution coefficient of 0. 45 and 0. 29, respectively. The ice crystal size was lower for the falling-film technique; this explains the higher solute occlusion. The dewatering capacity was higher for the falling-film technique, as this process is faster than block <b>freeze-concentration.</b> The most abundant volatile compounds of the coffee extracts were preserved after freeze concentration with both techniques. In the same way, {{no differences were found}} in most of the sensory attributes of the freeze-concentrated extract obtained using both techniques. Our results confirm the benefits of the block and falling-film freeze concentration techniques in preserving the quality of coffee extracts. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|Dilute {{volatile}} acidic {{aqueous solution}} was frozen by various freezing methods, and concentrations of solutes and pH {{of the sample}} were measured after the sample was completely thawed. Concentration of the volatile acid anion in the sample decreased, and pH of the sample increased after freezing. The decrease of solutes in the sample was almost equal to that detected in the gas phase. When dilute salt solution was frozen, solutes were excluded from ice and concentrated into the unfrozen solution. Concentrated anion combines with concentrated proton to form volatile acid such as acetic, formic or nitrous acid without reaction with any other chemicals. These volatile acids are saturated, and evaporation to the gas phase occurs. It is considered that the decrease in concentration of various solutes is mainly due to the <b>freeze-concentration</b> effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability for}} <b>freeze-concentration</b> {{inhibition}} (FCI) was examined for type I antifreeze protein (AFPI) and antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) through {{the observation of}} the condensation of red-colored ink in an ice block for various concentrations of the proteins. The thermal hysteresis (TH), which indicates the ice growth inhibition strength, and ice-shaping ability were also examined for the two samples. The amount of AFPI and AFGP necessary for FCI {{was determined to be}} 0. 1 mg/ml and 0. 25 mg/ml, respectively. There {{was no significant difference in}} the TH of both samples. AFPI and AFGP shaped the ice crystals into hexagonal trapezohedrons and hexagonal bipyramids, respectively, where the former was thinner than the latter. These results suggest that a principle determinant of FCI is the ice-shaping ability, rather than the ice growth inhibition of AFPs...|$|E
40|$|Falling-film freeze {{concentration}} {{is a technique}} for concentration of liquids by freezing the available water {{in the form of}} a layer of ice on a refrigerated surface. Processing at low temperatures keeps the organoleptic properties of the initial product. In this study the freeze concentration of whey was investigated as an technological alternative for the use of this byproduct of the dairy industry. Freeze concentration tests were carried out in pilot-scale equipment and the increase in soluble solids content of the whey and the amount and purity of the ice formed were analysed. Electrical conductivity, viscosity and freezing point of the concentrated whey were determined. The concentrate obtained had a solid concentration of up to 21. 8 ºBrix.

40|$|The {{alkaline}} phosphatase catalyzed hydrolysis of disodium-p-nitrophenyl phosphate was studied in four model systems comprising sucrose, maltodextrin, carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), and CMC-lactose in a temperature range of - 28 to 20 degreesC. In the maltodextrin and CMC-lactose model systems, the reaction rate decreased to a very. low value as the {{glass transition temperature}} was approached, In the CMC and CMC-lactose systems with low initial solute concentration,, {{as a consequence of}} <b>freeze-concentration,</b> a rate maximum around the initial freezing temperature was observed. The Arrhenius equation described the temperature dependence of the reaction rate both in the liquid and the glassy states in all systems studied, while a slightly curved Arrhenius plot was observed in the "rubbery" state of the CMC and CMC-lactose systems. The WLF equation with system-dependent coefficients described the kinetics in the rubbery state of all the model systems except sucrose, excluding the short temperature range where reaction rate enhancement with decreasing temperature was observed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC) {{was used}} to {{investigate}} thermal transitions of pomegranate extracts {{as a function of}} concentration. The transitions were the glass transition temperatures (Tg) and maximum <b>freeze-concentration</b> condition (T'g), melting points (Tf), the onset temperatures of ice melting (T'm), and latent heat of fusion (HL). In addition, the specific heat (Cp) below and above freezing was also determined. The soluble solid contents for the pomegranate extracts ranged from 20 to 53 Brix. The Tg and T'g values ranged from - 43. 3 to - 49. 3 and from - 44. 9 to - 52. 0 °C, respec vely. On the other hand, Tf and T'm ranged from - 2. 6 to - 16. 7 and from - 39. 6 to - 45. 3 C, respectively. The latent heat of fusion was between 61. 6 and 204. 7 kJ/kg. Below freezing, a linear relationship was established between specific heat and temperature, while above freezing range the change of specific heat was relatively low.

40|$|Both <b>freeze-concentration</b> {{and high}} {{pressure}} treatments are promising technologies {{that can be}} combined {{in order to improve}} juice quality and increase shelf life. Mathematical modeling is a useful tool to design, to develop and to optimize these processes but it faces a lack of data on physical properties of foods at high pressure. For that reason, the volumetric properties of orange juice and concentrates (12 to 40 °Brix) were determined at temperatures between - 20 °C and + 40 °C and pressures up to 350. MPa. A variable volume piezometer was used for that purpose. The coefficients of an equation of state initially developed for water were fitted to allow for calculating the specific volume as a function of pressure and temperature. The isothermal compressibility and the thermal expansion coefficients calculated from the resulting equation of state show similar behaviors as those of water with some subtle differences. Temperatures of specific volume and compressibility coefficients minima are shifted toward lower values than those of water as solutes concentration increases. Volumetric properties progressively tend to behave as those of a solid. Any use of water properties to approximate orange juice concentrate properties behavior under pressure gives rise to significant uncertainties when calculating adiabatic heat. Studies about the sensitivity of models to each property and to their respective uncertainty would help in pointing out experimental needs and accuracy requirements for the determination of food thermophysical properties at high pressure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Liquid-like regions (LLRs) {{are found}} at the {{surfaces}} and grain boundaries of ice and as inclusions within ice. These regions contain most of the solutes in ice and can be (photo) chemically active hotspots in natural snow and ice systems. If we assume all solutes partition into LLRs as a solution freezes, freezing-point depression predicts that the concentration of a solute in LLRs is higher than its concentration in the prefrozen (or melted) solution by the <b>freeze-concentration</b> factor (F). Here we use singlet molecular oxygen production to explore the effects of total solute concentration ([TS]) and temperature on experimentally determined values of F. For ice above its eutectic temperature, measured values of F agree well with freezing-point depression when [TS] is above ∼ 1 mmol/kg; at lower [TS] values, measurements of F are lower than predicted from freezing-point depression. For ice below its eutectic temperature, the influence of freezing-point depression on F is damped; the extreme case is with Na 2 SO 4 as the solute, where F shows essentially no agreement with freezing-point depression. In contrast, for ice containing 3 mmol/kg NaCl, measured values of F agree well with freezing-point depression over a range of temperatures, including below the eutectic. Our experiments also reveal that the photon flux in LLRs increases {{in the presence of}} salts, which has implications for ice photochemistry in the lab and, perhaps, in the environment. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} Restricted Access. It was {{published}} in the journal, Journal of Hydrology [© Elsevier] and is available at: [URL] bulk meltwaters and active-layer groundwaters were sampled from the proglacial zone of Finsterwalderbreen during a single melt season in 1999, {{in order to determine the}} geochemical processes that maintain high chemical weathering rates in the proglacial zone of this glacier. Results demonstrate that the principle means of solute acquisition is the weathering of highly reactive moraine and fluvial active-layer sediments by supra-permafrost groundwaters. Active-layer groundwater derives from the thaw of the proglacial snowpack, buried ice and glacial bulk meltwaters. Groundwater evolves by sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution. Evaporation- and <b>freeze-concentration</b> of groundwater in summer and winter, respectively produce Mg–Ca-sulphate salts on the proglacial surface. Re-dissolution of these salts in early summer produces groundwaters that are supersaturated with respect to calcite. There is a pronounced spatial pattern to the geochemical evolution of groundwater. Close to the main proglacial channel, active layer sediments are flushed diurnally by bulk meltwaters. Here, Mg–Ca-sulphate deposits become exhausted in the early season and geochemical evolution proceeds by a combination of sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution. At greater distances from the channel, the dissolution of Mg–Ca-sulphate salts is a major influence and dilution by the bulk meltwaters is relatively minor. The influence of sulphate salt dissolution decreases during the sampling season, as these salts are exhausted and waters become increasingly routed by subsurface flowpaths...|$|E
40|$|Stem cell {{cryopreservation}} in three-dimensional (3 D) scaffolds {{may offer}} better protection to cells leading to higher survival rates. However, it introduces heterogeneity in cryoprotective agent (CPA) concentrations, durations {{of exposure to}} CPA, and freezing and thawing rate within constructs. This paper applies a mathematical model which couples the mass transport of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in a cell-seeded spherical construct and cell membrane transport into mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to predict overall cell survival rate (CSR) based on CPA equilibrium exposure times (t(E)) and concentrations. The effect of <b>freeze-concentration</b> is also considered. To enable such a prediction, a contour plot was constructed using experimental data obtained in cryopreservation of cell suspensions with DMSO at a cooling rate of 1 degrees C/min. Thereafter, the diffusion in the alginate bead and the membrane transport of CPA was numerically simulated. Results were mapped onto the survival rate contours yielding 'predicted' CSR. The effects of loading time, hindrance, construct radius, and CPA concentration on predicted CSR were examined. From these results, an operation window with upper and lower t(E) of 12 - 19 min (for 0. 6 mm radius beads and 1. 4 M DMSO) yielded an overall viability of 60 per cent. The model predictions and the best experimental cryopreservation results with encapsulated mESCs were in agreement. Hence, optimization based on post-thaw CSR can accelerate the identification of cryopreservation protocols and parameters for maximizing cell survival...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2015. Major: Pharmaceutics. Advisor: Jayanth Panyam, Ph. D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 215 pages. Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle (NP) {{is a widely}} used biodegradable carrier for drug and vaccine delivery. This thesis focused on the formulation, delivery and efficacy of PLGA NP for its potential application in melanoma immunotherapy. To enable reliable PLGA NP formulation for clinical use such as vaccination, lyophilization is the method of choice to manufacture dry NP dosage form. A major risk of the lyophilization product development for NPs is the irreversible NP aggregation due to freezing and drying stress. Based on real-time imaging, freezing stress {{could be attributed to}} <b>freeze-concentration</b> of NPs. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) revealed individual NP separately embedded in the freeze-concentrate interstitial space of the sucrose formulation, leading to corroborative support for the "particle isolation" hypothesis of cryo-protection. Various sphere packing models were investigated to guide the rational design of cryo-/lyo-protectant containing NP formulations. To facilitate precise intradermal delivery of NP formulation for vaccination, microneedle array-mediated administration was utilized to deliver large volume of NPs into the skin. The majority of the infused PLGA NPs were retained locally. A PLGA NP vaccine formulation delivered intradermally elicited robust humoral and cellular immunity. Antigen-loaded NP formulation triggered quicker and stronger high affinity antibody responses compared to the soluble antigen formulation. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of BRAF V 600 E, induces apoptotic melanoma cell death and remarkable tumor burden reduction. However, drug resistance invariably occurs. Novel TLR 7 / 8 agonists were encapsulated in PLGA particulate formulation as immunostimulatory nanoparticles (ISNP) to boost immune response against drug-resistant melanoma. NP-mediated intracellular delivery contributed to enhanced dendritic cell activation in vitro and antigen-specific CD 8 + T cell proliferation in vivo. The prophylactic vaccination using NP-assisted whole tumor cell formulation prolonged the survival of mice challenged with melanoma. To take advantage of the clearance of melanoma antigens by immune system in the context of BRAF inhibition, an ISNP-assisted in situ whole tumor cell vaccination strategy was investigated using BRAF V 600 E positive mouse SM 1 melanoma cells. Despite the suppressed tumor growth, no survival benefit was observed in this therapeutic vaccination model...|$|E
