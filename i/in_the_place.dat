5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient.

González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year.

Heavy water, which consists of deuterium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806.

5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance.

Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book.
