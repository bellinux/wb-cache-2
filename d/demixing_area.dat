40|$|Spinodal {{decomposition}} {{is observed}} {{in a variety of}} materials, such as metal alloys, oxide glasses, mineral solid solutions, steels, gels, ceramics and mixtures of polymers and liquids. Itâ€™s an irreversible process in which the transition of solid or liquid solutions is not triggered by nucleation and growth from a sudden concentration peak, but by local sinusoidal fluctuations in the concentration of the components. It occurs, when rapidly quenched, in the thermodynamically unstable region of the <b>demixing</b> <b>area,</b> beyond the spinodal. The spinodal which leads to spontaneous decomposition is the spinodal of the coherent free energy curve of the metastable coherent phase diagram. The early-stage kinetics of spinodal decomposition of a binary alloy A-B can be obtained with a nonlinear diffusion equation, the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook equation, with constant mobility. The equation with variable mobility, describes the later-stage and the coarsening process. In this report the process of spinodal decomposition is discussed phenomenological and mathematically. Also two examples of materials in which decomposition takes place are given, i. e. computer simulations in solids and mineral alkali feldspar solid solution in geology...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{transfer}} during membrane formation {{by means}} of phase inversion for a polymeric system with both a solid-liquid and a liquid-liquid equilibrium was studied {{on the basis of}} the theory developed by Reuvers and Smolders. During the first moments of immersion in the coagulation bath, the concentrations at the interface between bath and film are governed by the virtual liquid-liquid equilibrium. This equilibrium no longer exists at a larger time scale. The interfacial concentrations as a result of the local liquid-liquid equilibrium during mass transfer are located deeply in the crystallization region or solid-liquid <b>demixing</b> <b>area</b> and after an induction time the solid-liquid phase separation (crystallization) takes place when membranes are formed with an initial polymer concentration of 20 % or larger. The calculated initial concentration profiles show a shallow pattern in polymer content for the films with initial concentration of 20 and 25 %. From the calculated initial concentration profiles an isotropic morphology in the final membrane can beexpected. A steep increase of the polymer concentration at the interface was observed for the more concentrated filmscorrelated with a skinned morphology in the final membrane...|$|E
