500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Tess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall {{inhabited}} the character so fully that she only {{got to know}} Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director Bruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> skin crawling {{up the back of}} his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, [...] "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny." [...] Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.|$|E
2500|$|As Barks blossomed creatively, his {{marriage}} to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was {{at one of these}} in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are {{in the collection of the}} Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story [...] "Christmas in Duckburg", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.|$|E
50|$|In issue #47, He {{mentioned}} to Fugitoid and Harold he {{is connected to}} his body's vital signs. Indicating <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> body and was slowly getting back to normal.|$|R
60|$|Amyas started back, {{and held}} Frank by the {{shoulders}} at arm's length; as he did so, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> through, that <b>his</b> brother's arms were but skin and bone.|$|R
5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin {{held on to}} his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|R
60|$|Then Coulthurst, {{apparently}} by {{a supreme}} effort, raised himself a trifle, {{and he was}} a foot or two nearer the fir when he lay prone again. Ingleby fancied <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> sinews cracking, and knew they would not endure that tension long.|$|E
60|$|This {{last was}} said in a note of anxious sneering that made Gerald's veins tingle with fine hate for her. He leaned far out of the boat, {{reaching}} down into the water. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> position was ridiculous, his loins exposed behind him.|$|E
60|$|Of {{this man}} who was his father he could get no hold. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> presence, but never see him. Yet he had a face. It {{sometimes}} pressed Tommy's face against {{it in order to}} hurt him, which it could do, being all short needles at the chin.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was going}} to reach [...] "Many Waters" [...] in time to warn Anderson, and that fact gave him strange exultation. When it was assured {{and he had the}} eighty {{thousand}} dollars deposited in a bank <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> gray, gloomy future would have several happy memories. How would Lenore Anderson feel toward a man who had saved her father? The thought was too rich, too sweet for Kurt to dwell upon.|$|R
60|$|The play went on. But he {{was obsessed}} {{by the desire}} to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it. <b>His</b> whole face seemed {{suspended}} till he had put his lips there. It must be done. And the other people! At last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips. His moustache brushed the sensitive flesh. Clara shivered, drew away her arm.|$|R
50|$|As a young man, Lannoy had a {{military}} career, {{fighting against the}} Prince-Bishopric of Liège (1430), England (1436), Lorraine (1440) and the Electorate of Cologne (1447). In later life {{he wrote to his}} son that when called upon to speak in sessions of the council <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> self-conscious about <b>his</b> lack of education.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} she nestled to him, and he kissed her softly, her hair, her face, her ears, gently, softly, like dew falling. But this warm breath on her ears {{disturbed}} her again, kindled the old destructive fires. She cleaved to him, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> blood changing like quicksilver.|$|E
60|$|The men {{spread out}} at a low command, and Breckenridge smiled mirthlessly as he remembered the {{restrained}} eagerness with which he had waited outside English covers when the quarry was a fox. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart thumping furiously, and his mittened hands would tremble on the bridle. It seemed that the fugitive kept them waiting a horribly long while.|$|E
60|$|Immediately he {{lapsed into}} a kind of unconsciousness. He would have called it sleep, but such it was not. All the time <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> brain working ceaselessly, like a machine running with unslackening rapidity. This went on, {{interrupted}} by little flickerings of consciousness, for three or four hours. Each time he had a glimmer of consciousness he wondered if he made any noise.|$|E
5000|$|In the Japanese anime and BL game, DRAMAtical Murder, a {{supporting}} character named Noiz suffers from this disorder. When he was younger, his parents considered him a disgrace {{because he would}} play rough with other children because he didn't understand what pain felt like. The only pain <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> was from <b>his</b> tongue.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. Dick waited till <b>he</b> <b>could</b> regain {{some sort}} of control over himself. His hands were shaking, and he prided himself on their steadiness; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> lips were quivering, and the sweat was running down his face. He was lashed by fear, driven forward {{by the desire to}} get to work at once and {{accomplish}} something, and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news {{that he was about to}} go blind. 'It's a humiliating exhibition,' he thought, 'and I'm glad Torp isn't here to see. The doctor said I was to avoid mental worry.|$|R

60|$|She stole {{past him}} and stooped down with her ear to the keyhole. She frowned {{for a moment and}} held out her hand warningly. It seemed to him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart beating. Close to where he was standing, her silk {{stockings}} were hanging over the back of a chair.--He suddenly closed his eyes, covered them desperately with the palms of his hand. Her warning finger was still extended.|$|E
60|$|For long {{minutes as}} it seemed to Graham that inglorious {{struggle}} continued. His clothes were rent in a dozen places, he was covered in dust, one hand had been trodden upon. He could hear the shouts of his supporters, and once he heard shots. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> strength giving way, feel his efforts wild and aimless. But no help came, and surely, irresistibly, that black, yawning opening came nearer.|$|E
60|$|Surprise {{had caused}} him to halt, and with a {{thoughtful}} and puzzled {{expression on his face}} {{he looked down at his}} feet. It startled him anew to discover that he had no feet. He reached out his hands, but he could not see them. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> hands and arms and body; he stamped his feet on the grass and knew they were there, but in some strange way they had become invisible.|$|E
60|$|Again he {{ran down}} the side of the tank, and again she climbed the scaffold. But this time his wind and {{endurance}} enabled him to cut down her lead, so that she was driven to the twenty-foot platform. She took no time for posturing or swanning, but tilted immediately off in a stiff dive, angling toward the west side of the tank. Almost they were in the air at the same time. In the water and under it, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> against <b>his</b> face and arms the agitation left by her progress; but she led into the deep shadow thrown by the low afternoon sun, where the water was so dark <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see nothing.|$|R
25|$|In the meantime, he {{was offered}} {{a job as a}} trainee in Standard Oil Company (Mobil) in 1962 and he opted for it while hoping to go to Germany. When he {{returned}} from his training, he found out to his dismay that his father had written to AEG declining to send him to Germany. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> father was not prepared to let him go away out of love, and he accepted this as such. In the meantime, his cousin Kazi Abdur Rasheed also arranged for him to proceed to the USA to do his master's degree, but in deference to his father’s wishes he remained behind in India to work with Standard Oil Company.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the bushes}} were burst asunder, {{and the great}} yellow body hurled itself forward upon Charlie. The attack was so sudden and {{instantaneous}} that the latter had not even time to raise his rifle to his shoulder. Almost instinctively, however, he discharged both of the barrels; but was, at the same moment, hurled to the ground, where he lay crushed down {{by the weight of}} the tiger, whose hot breath <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> on <b>his</b> face. <b>He</b> closed his eyes, only to open them again at the sound of a heavy blow, while a deluge of hot blood flowed over him. He heard Hossein's voice, and then became insensible. When he recovered, he found himself lying with his head supported by Hossein, outside the jungle.|$|R
60|$|The magician {{instantly}} {{realized he}} was being enchanted, for <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> form changing. He struggled desperately against the enchantment, mumbling magic words and making magic passes with his hands. And in one way he succeeded in defeating Dorothy's purpose, for while his form soon changed {{to that of a}} gray dove, the dove was of an enormous size, bigger even than Ugu had been as a man, and this feat {{he had been able to}} accomplish before his powers of magic wholly deserted him.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{though his}} pulses throbbed, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> blood tingling, {{he fell to}} work systematically, groping about the {{excavation}} the dead man had made where the snowslide had rent apart the forest and scored out the rock for him. Here and there he smashed a fragment of it {{with the back of}} the axe, or picked up a discoloured stone of unusual gravity and compared it with the pieces he took out of a little bag, until at last he stood up stiffly and flung his head back.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What am I doing? What is the matter? Am I unconscious? Do I {{make any}} noise? Do I disturb them?' he wondered, {{and he tried}} to cast back to find the record of {{mechanical}} sense impression. He believed he could remember the sound of inarticulate murmuring in his throat. Immediately he remembered, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> throat producing the sounds. This frightened him. Above all things, he was afraid of disturbing the family. He roused himself to listen. Everything was breathing in silence. As he listened to this silence he relapsed into his sort of sleep.|$|E
50|$|Strange recounts that a {{scene with}} the Monster stuck in {{quicksand}} was particularly arduous for him. On top of three hours of getting into makeup, Strange {{spent the rest of}} the day buried in cold sand, including during the lunch break, and was so cold by midafternoon that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> legs. Lon Chaney Jr. attempted to help Strange keep warm by passing him a bottle of scotch, with the result that Strange was so drunk that after getting out of costume and makeup, he had difficulty dressing himself in his street clothes. Chaney's drinking contributed to his reputation as being difficult to work with, and probably was the reason Universal let him go after the film was completed.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had been}} intently {{watching}} the excited speaker; {{but as he}} regretfully added those last words I turned again, and Robert's eyes met mine,--those melancholy eyes, so full of an intelligence that proved he had heard, remembered, and reflected with that preternatural power which often outlives all other faculties. He knew me, yet gave no greeting; {{was glad to see}} a woman's face, yet had no smile wherewith to welcome it; felt that he was dying, yet uttered no farewell. He was too far across the river to return or linger now; departing thought, strength, breath, were spent in one grateful look, one murmur of submission to the last pang <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>feel.</b> <b>His</b> lips moved, and, bending to them, a whisper chilled my cheek, as it shaped the broken words,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Encouraged by {{this good}} news, revived {{by a long}} night's sleep, he went towards noon to pay his {{postponed}} visit to Regina. At that early hour, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> sure that <b>his</b> interview with her would not be interrupted by visitors. She received him quietly and seriously, pressing his hand with a warmer fondness than usual. He had anticipated some complaint of his absence on the previous day, and some severe allusion to his appearance in the capacity of a Socialist lecturer. Regina's indulgence, or Regina's interest in circumstances of more pressing importance, preserved a merciful silence on both subjects.|$|R
60|$|Even then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> {{strength}} leaving him. Had {{he escaped}} those hounds and the terrible hunters {{only to be}} drowned in the Big River? This new fear gave him more strength for a little while. But it did not last long. He was three fourths of {{the way across the}} Big River but still that other shore seemed a long distance away. Little by little hope died in the heart of Lightfoot the Deer. He would keep on just {{as long as he could}} and then,--well, it was better to drown than to be torn to pieces by dogs.|$|E
60|$|Appleby said nothing, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart thumping painfully as {{he leaned}} on the table until Morales came in. He carried his kepi in one hand, and though he greeted Appleby punctiliously {{there was a little}} gleam in his eyes, while for just a moment he glanced keenly at Maccario. In the {{meanwhile}} Appleby saw Pancho’s face at the lattice behind his shoulder, and surmised that Morales was running a heavy risk just then. He had little esteem for the Spanish colonel, but {{it seemed to him that}} the fate of the San Cristoval hacienda, as well as its manager, depended upon what happened during the next five minutes.|$|E
60|$|Precisely {{the moment}} when such a thought came to him, he could not say, but before he had {{finished}} reading his attention was partially distracted by a curious and instinctive conviction. He {{felt that he was}} not alone--that the solitude of his chamber, high up in the building and cut off, as it were, from the world, had been broken. He ceased reading, and although he was no coward <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart beating. He felt a strange reluctance to turn round. Then the silence was broken. Close to his left ear sounded the click of a revolver, and a man's voice came to him from out of the shadows.|$|E
60|$|The tug's bow rose {{high above}} him, but he doubted if the tide {{had left her}} stern. So far as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> with <b>his</b> feet, the stones were covered by broken shells, and he smelt paint. In the tropics, {{the bottom of an}} iron vessel soon gets crusted with shells and weed, and it looked as if the crew had scraped the boat. When the plates were clean they would paint her with red-oxide before {{applying}} the anti-fouling coat. It was important for him to find out which they had put on, because, since they could only work at low-water, this might mean a difference of a day or two in the time needed to finish the job. All the same, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not take it for granted that she would be ready for sea when the last coat was dry. He understood her engines were being overhauled, and must ascertain if the work were done.|$|R
60|$|There {{were a few}} dazzling, dreamy {{minutes when}} Moses first held that frail form in his arms, which but for its tender, mortal warmth, might have seemed to him a spirit. It was no spirit, but a woman whose heart <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> thrilling against <b>his</b> own; who seemed to him like some frail, {{fluttering}} bird; but somehow, as he looked into her clear, transparent face, and pressed her thin little hands in his, the conviction stole over him overpoweringly that she was indeed fading away and going from him,--drawn from him by that mysterious, irresistible power against which human strength, even in the strongest, has no chance.|$|R
60|$|James {{dared not}} see her. It was {{obviously}} best to have destroyed the letter. After all, {{it was probably}} {{nothing more than a}} curt, formal congratulation, and its coldness would nearly have broken his heart. He feared also lest in his never-ceasing thought he had crystallised his beloved into something quite different from reality. His imagination was very active, and its constant play upon those few recollections might easily have added many a false delight. To meet Mrs. Wallace would only bring perhaps a painful disillusion; and of that James was terrified, for without this passion which occupied his whole soul he would be now singularly alone in the world. It was a fantastic, charming figure that he had made for himself, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> worship it without danger and without reproach. Was it not better to preserve his dream from the sullen irruption of fact? But why would that perfume come perpetually entangling itself with his memory? It gave the image new substance; and when he closed his eyes, the woman seemed so near that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> against <b>his</b> face the fragrance of her breath.|$|R
