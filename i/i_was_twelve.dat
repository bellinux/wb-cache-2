500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E

Part <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>twelve</b> selected papers on teaching in technical education prepared for Education Professions Development Act (EPDA) Project 72042.
