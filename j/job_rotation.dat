2500|$|The Humanistic Approach to {{job design}} was a {{reaction}} to [...] "worker dissatisfaction over Scientific Management" [...] and focused on providing employees with more input {{and an opportunity to}} maximize their personal achievement as referenced by Jex and Britt. Jobs should also provide intellectual stimulation, opportunities for creativity, and greater discretion over work-related activities. Two approaches used in the Humanistic Approach to job design are <b>job</b> <b>rotation</b> and job enrichment. <b>Job</b> <b>rotation</b> allows employees to switch to different jobs which allows them to learn new skills and provides them with greater variety. According to Jex and Britt, this would be most effective for simple jobs that can become mundane and boring over time. Job enrichment is focused on leveraging those aspects of jobs that are labeled motivators, such as control, intellectual challenge, and creativity. The most common form of job enrichment is vertical loading where additional tasks or discretion enhances the initial job design. While there is some evidence to support that job enrichment improves motivation, {{it is important to note}} that it is not effective for all people. Some employees are not more motivated by enriched jobs.|$|E

Although implicit leadership theories and the value orientations and self-concept that underlie them are relatively stable, it does not mean they could not be changed at all.

The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a significant relationship existed between participation in a mentoring program and three measures of job success when analyzed by selected behavioral style variables. The study was an ex post factor field study which utilized 40 pairs of protected class lower-level managers. The two independent variables were mentoring and behavioral style. The three dependent variables were: percent of salary change, number of <b>job</b> <b>rotations,</b> and changes in promotability ratings [...] all measured over a one-year period. All subjects were employees of a large midwestern public utility. This company was selected because it had in operation a formal mentoring program for protected class managers. The experimental group consisted of the 40 mentees who had been in this company's formal mentoring program for approximately one year. The control group was matched subject-by-subject on seven demographic variables. The Level I: Life Styles Inventory was used to measure the participants' behavioral styles. These 12 LSI styles were then analyzed according to their four major quadrants: concern for task and satisfaction, concern for people and satisfaction, concern for people and security, and concern for task and security. The data were also analyzed according to task versus people and satisfaction versus security behavioral style orientation. All analyses were done by computer utilizing factorial analysis of variance. A significant interaction was found between group and style for the dependent variable of salary change. The task/satisfaction oriented mentored managers had a larger percent salary increase than the controls while the nonmentored managers with a people/security orientation had higher increases than the mentored. No significant main effects were found for salary change. For the second dependent variable, number of <b>job</b> <b>rotations,</b> no significant main effects nor significant interactions were found. A significant difference was found between the mentored and nonmentored groups on the promotability rating change index.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on labor market dynamics in four ways. First, unlike most of the existing literature, it uses the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). This panel survey, with a 32 -month window of observation, allows a more precise measure of employment flows than other data sources. It was found that one out of three workers experiences a job transition during the observation period. Second, it focuses on the state of California during an economic cycle. According to these estimates, the net decline in employment represents just 2. 6 percent of all <b>job</b> <b>rotations</b> (separations offset by accessions), and gross job flows were as important during the downturn as they were during the economic expansion. Third, it estimates gross flows by sector, and finds significant variation in gross flows relative to employment across sectors of economic activity. Fourth, it examines the coexistence of cyclical and structural changes of California in the early 1990 s. The results suggest a labor market link between structural changes and economic cycles.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} pieces of this theory is that management must have a high degree of confidence in its workers in order for this type of participative management to work. This theory assumes that workers will be participating in the decisions of the company to a great degree. Ouchi explains that the employees must be very knowledgeable about the various issues of the company, as well as possessing the competence to make those decisions. He also points out; however, that management sometimes has a tendency to underestimate the ability of the workers to effectively contribute to the decision making process (Bittel, 1989). But for this reason, Theory Z stresses the need for the workers to become generalists, rather than specialists, and to increase their knowledge of the company and its processes through <b>job</b> <b>rotations</b> and constant training. Actually, promotions tend to be slower in this type of setting, as workers are given a much longer opportunity to receive training and more time to learn {{the ins and outs of}} the company's operations. The desire, under this theory, is to develop a work force, which has more of a loyalty towards staying with the company for an entire career, and be more permanent than in other types of settings. It is expected that once an employee does rise to a position of high level management, they will know a great deal more about the company and how it operates, and will be able to use Theory Z management theories effectively on the newer employees (Luthans, 1989, p. 36).|$|R

Aims: To assess the prevalence, patterns, and factors associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) among pluckers in a tea plantation in Annamalai, Tamil Nadu, India. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study surveyed 195 pluckers selected by simple random sampling aged between 18 years and 60 years. Materials and Methods: The interview schedule had four parts––sociodemographic detail, Standard Nordic Scale, numeric and facial pain rating tool, and a tool to assess factors associated with WRMDs. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. Results: Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in the last 12 months and the last 7 days was 83. 6 % and 78. 5 %, respectively. The most common site for last 1 year was shoulder (59 %) and for last 7 days was the lower back (52. 8 %).

30|$|To {{select the}} other {{covariates}} that we include in our model {{to predict the}} probability of being an internal trainer {{at the end of}} career, we rely on the previous studies in management about the determinants of mentor–protégé relationships. In our regressions, we include the gender, age, marital status, educational level, occupational level, seniority and the quartile groups of the logarithm of the net daily wage. To control for a potential effect of health, we introduce a dummy indicating the presence of health limitations. Regarding the employment relationship, we control for full time or part time jobs. 9 In addition, the management literature puts forward that spatial proximity or <b>job</b> <b>rotations</b> facilitate the initiation of mentor–protégé relationships. This is why we include a dummy for employees who change location frequently to perform their job and another one for employees who have changed colleagues over the last 12  months. We also control for time constraints that may impair the quality of transmission (Thébault et al. 2012), measured by a pace of work which is imposed by an external demand needing an immediate response. Regarding the employer, we know the sector, the size and the age structure of each firm. 10 Finally, the COI survey provides information about participation in training programs between 2003 and 2006. We choose to focus on the training programs regarding the use of new ICT tools. Indeed, the required adaptation to ICT changes in the early 2000 s was no more an issue of computer literacy but that of being able to complete tasks with a computer rather than directly. This has possibly created a situation where the use of some of the skills acquired through experience has become conditional on mastering a new ICT tool.|$|R
