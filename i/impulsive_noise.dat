It is a non-linear equivalent to taking a moving average (or other smoothing technique) of a time series, and is similar to other non-linear smoothing techniques, such as Tukey or median smoothing.

50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22 Hz to 22 kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses RMS detection for no particular reason). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on <b>impulsive</b> <b>noise</b> take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This quasi-peak measurement is also called psophometric weighting.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} concern over {{interference}} between narrowband and UWB signals that {{share the same}} spectrum. Earlier, the only radio technology that used pulses were spark-gap transmitters, which international treaties banned because they interfere with medium-wave receivers. UWB, however, uses lower power. The subject was extensively covered in the proceedings {{that led to the}} adoption of the FCC rules in the U.S. and in the meetings relating to UWB of the ITU-R leading to its Report and Recommendations on UWB technology. Commonly used electrical appliances emit <b>impulsive</b> <b>noise</b> (for example, hair dryers) and proponents successfully argued that the noise floor would not be raised excessively by wider deployment of low power wideband transmitters.|$|E

The normalized maximum correntropy criterion (NMCC) {{is derived from}} a correntropy based cost function, which is rather robust with respect to <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises.</b> To deal with the noisy input, we introduce a bias-compensated vector (BCV) to the NMCC algorithm, and then an unbiasedness criterion and some reasonable assumptions are used to compute the BCV. Taking advantage of the BCV, the bias caused by the input noise can be effectively suppressed.

5000|$|While some {{consider}} the noise reduction of a suppressor significant enough to permit safe shooting without hearing protection ("hearing safe"), noise-induced hearing loss may occur at 85 time-weighted-average decibels or above if exposed for a prolonged period, and suppressed gunshots regularly meter above 130 dB. However, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration uses 140 dB as the [...] "safety cutoff" [...] for <b>impulsive</b> <b>noise,</b> {{which has led}} most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140 dB suppressors as [...] "hearing safe". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to impact noise over 130 dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single [...]308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of suppressors to wear additional ear protection.|$|E
50|$|Median {{filtering}} is {{one kind}} of smoothing technique, as is linear Gaussian filtering. All smoothing techniques are effective at removing noise in smooth patches or smooth regions of a signal, but adversely affect edges. Often though, {{at the same time}} as reducing the noise in a signal, it is important to preserve the edges. Edges are of critical importance to the visual appearance of images, for example. For small to moderate levels of (Gaussian) noise, the median filter is demonstrably better than Gaussian blur at removing noise whilst preserving edges for a given, fixed window size. However, its performance is not that much better than Gaussian blur for high levels of noise, whereas, for speckle noise and salt-and-pepper noise (<b>impulsive</b> <b>noise),</b> it is particularly effective. Because of this, median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing.|$|E
5000|$|Noise in {{hospitals}} {{has been a}} problem for at least fifty years, {{in part because of the}} need to have all surfaces hard and cleanable. A large number of measurements and reports in prestigious journals have established the problem [...] From the patient’s viewpoint the problem has been the distraction and annoyance caused by the noise of people, which results in less rest, poorer sleep, and possibly longer recuperation time. The increased socialization now permitted {{in hospitals}}, as well as the increased use of medical machinery, has exacerbated the problem. An extensive survey by the Public Health Service in 1963 showed that patients were frequently disturbed by speech and distress sounds in other rooms as well as staff visits during night hours. Other studies concerned the interference of sleep and recuperation by noise. One study found that the amount and rate of increase in the sound level from the constant background was the main contributor to full awakening or changes in the stage of sleep. It was determined that the magnitude of the change in level, regardless of its median value, was more significant than the level of a steady sound of the same median value. This conclusion was supported by an Environmental Protection Agency document. [...] Suter [...] expanded this finding by stating [...] "it is clear that intermittent and <b>impulsive</b> <b>noise</b> is more disturbing than continuous noise of equivalent energy, and that meaningful sounds are more likely to produce sleep disruption than sounds with neutral content." [...] These conclusions were the same as those found for open offices.|$|E
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} called maximum correntropy unscented Kalman filter (MCUKF) {{is proposed}} {{and applied to}} relative state estimation in space communication networks. As is well known, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) provides an efficient tool to solve the non-linear state estimate problem. However, the UKF usually plays well in Gaussian noises. Its performance may deteriorate substantially {{in the presence of}} non-Gaussian noises, especially when the measurements are disturbed by some heavy-tailed <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises.</b> By making use of the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC), the proposed algorithm can enhance the robustness of UKF against <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises.</b> In the MCUKF, the unscented transformation (UT) is applied to obtain a predicted state estimation and covariance matrix, and a nonlinear regression method with the MCC cost is then used to reformulate the measurement information.

However, when the signals are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises,</b> the performance of KF will deteriorate seriously. To improve the robustness of KF against <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises,</b> we propose in this work a new Kalman filter, called the maximum correntropy Kalman filter (MCKF), which adopts the robust maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) as the optimality criterion, instead of using the MMSE. Similar to the traditional KF, the state mean and covariance matrix propagation equations are used to give prior estimations of the state and covariance matrix in MCKF. A novel fixed-point algorithm is then used to update the posterior estimations. A sufficient condition that guarantees the convergence of the fixed-point algorithm is given. Illustration examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new algorithm. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, 7 table...|$|R

Although the UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises.</b> To improve the robustness of the UKF against <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises,</b> a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF).

40|$|Constrained {{adaptive}} filtering algorithms inculding constrained least mean square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) have been extensively studied in many applications. Most existing constrained {{adaptive filtering}} algorithms are developed under {{mean square error}} (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises,</b> this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is easy to implement and has low computational complexity, {{and in terms of}} convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in presence of heavy-tailed <b>impulsive</b> <b>noises.</b> Additionally, the mean square convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non- Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods.
