40|$|This {{abstract}} {{is written}} on the 11 th of September 2006 [...] -the fifth anniversary of the 9 / 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda. These attacks are taken to be {{a turning point in}} the relationship between Islam and the West. For the author, these attacks, the overwhelming counter-attacks by some of the western states on some Islamic states, as well as the endless Palestinian-Israeli disputes, are the result of misunderstanding and misconceptions that Islam and the West have of each other. While politics and politicians are destroying means of communication amongst these nations by the creation of such a state of war, scholars should exert their best efforts to build bridges of understanding and tolerance. This thesis is but a single brick in the much needed bridge of communication and understanding between the great civilisations of west and east. It seeks to show how the world's various legal traditions can benefit from each other. It attempts to do so by introducing the Islamic system of diyah and showing how it can interplay with and impact on the interpretation of international law. The example chosen is the existing set of <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> liability conventions. 9 / 11 reminds us that attacks on air transport have been a chosen means of sowing conflict. Yet peaceful use of air transport is among the most practical ties that bind the world together. <b>Air</b> <b>carrier</b> liability conventions render international air transport possible. The thesis shows how Islamic diyah can productively interact with these conventions. It can act as a median point at which the two extremes of the Warsaw System prescribing limited liability and the Montreal Convention prescribing unlimited liability can meet. The thesis shows as well how diyah can provide a useful methodology for <b>integrating</b> <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> contractual and extra-contractual liability regimes. To assist the reader unfamiliar with Islamic-fiqh, the thesis it is divided into two parts. The first is devoted to an introduction to Islamic-fiqh, and the second treats the interaction of diyah with the <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> liability conventions...|$|R

This {{was the result of the}} U.S. Navy not having developed the systems and procedures required to <b>integrate</b> its <b>carrier</b> <b>air</b> groups into a joint air component command, as Cold War-era tactics had the Navy operating on its own. Navy fighters were not able to solve the strict rules of engagement (ROE) using most of their on-board sensors and relied on outside clearance such as U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentries to receive permission to fire. In contrast, U.S. Air Force F-15s had the systems necessary to independently identify enemy aircraft from beyond visual range and were given the primary overland combat air patrol stations to intercept Iraqi aircraft that made it into the air.|$|R

We evaluate a total cost model for Federal Express, Inc. by analyzing quarterly time-series data from 1986 - 1992.

We show that these two economic concepts can be restrictive, however, and introduce a third aspect of the <b>integrated</b> <b>air</b> freight industry’s economic structure that combines the effects of economies of density and economies of scale. We call it economies of size, and show that Federal Express exhibits approximately constant economies of size. The conditions under which these findings hold are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The San Francisco Bay Area {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} metropolitan corridors in both California and nationwide, with very high demand for both passenger and air-freight transport. It is also a main entrance to the United States for the huge Asia market, and thus critical for the United States to play a leading role in the global economy. On one hand, traffic congestion in the main corridors through the Bay Area is severe and is becoming worse with the rapid increase of population and the development of the local economy, in which a substantial impact is created by truck-related activities such as the ever increasing air freight business (performed by companies such as Federal Express, UPS, DHL, and CNF). On the other hand, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) operates a regional environmentally-green transit system has excess capacity during non-commute periods and during the commute on some lines in some reverse-commute direction. If the BART system were to be used by the air-freight delivery service providers, BART could probably provide reliable service to <b>integrated</b> <b>air</b> freight <b>carriers</b> to meet their limited-time window delivery service needs. This would lead to additional revenue generation for BART. For the traveling public as well as local, regional, and state government it would reduce truck activity, and its corresponding negative impacts on traffic, environment, safety, land use and the economy. Using BART for air freight movement as a model for combined goods and passenger movement can be generalized to other critical corridors nationwide to effectively relieve corridor congestion problem. Improving movement through these critical metropolitan corridors could yield significant benefits in terms of reduced travel time and delays and increased reliability and predictability of both passenger and freight movement.
