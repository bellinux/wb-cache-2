40|$|The {{population}} {{projections for}} the Aboriginal identity groups (North American Indians, Métis and Inuit) {{by age and}} sex from 1996 to 2001 were developed at the Canada level, using the cohort-component method. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compare and analyze the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> between the projected 2001 and adjusted 2001 population counts due to net census undercounts. It is observed that the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> for the 2001 projected Aboriginal population based on the 1996 adjusted census population seems to be lower by 7 % over the 2001 Census adjusted Aboriginal population. In contrast, the projected populations for North American Indians and Inuit are lower by - 0. 20 % and - 2. 73 %. However, for the Métis the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> is extremely high, at - 24. 84 %. Reasons for the higher <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> for the Métis such as the effects of intra-generational ethnic mobility will be discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> is the {{population}} growth that cannot {{be accounted for by}} either natural increase or quantifiable non-demographic factors, and is an issue that is particularly pronounced for indigenous peoples. This paper estimates Australia’s indigenous population using the dual system estimation method, and compares these to those produced using the standard undercount method. The main conclusion is that dual system estimates of the indigenous population appear to be reasonably accurate at the national level, which provide an appreciation of the reliability of existing estimates. Notwithstanding, policy makers need to take into account that population statistics are merely estimates...|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} report {{released by the}} National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) documented the level of firearm mortality among children, youth, and young adults 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 34 years of age from 1979 through 1988. The purpose of this report is to revise the 1985 - 88 data using newly available intercensal population estimates and to update the report with data through 1990. Emphases are on race and sex differences in homicide and suicide associated with firearms among males 15 - 34 years of age. This report {{will be limited to}} data for the period 1985 through 1990 because it was {{during the second half of}} the decade that firearm mortality increased for the younger population. Firearm death rates for 1985 - 89 are based upon intercensal rather than the postcensal population estimates used in the {{previous report}}, Both sets of estimates were provided by the Bureau of the Census. Intercensal population estimates are preferred to postcensal estimates because they are consistent with the 1980 and 1990 decennial Census enumerations, and thus, form a continuous series over the decade. The relative difference between the two estimates, the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure,</b> is equivalent to the relative difference in death rates based on the two estimates, The <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> was larger for persons 1822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 24 years of age than for any other age group. However, the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> was not so large that death rates for either the black or the white populations ages 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 34 were significantly affected. Death rates for 1990 are based on postcensal estimates of the July 1, 1990, population. In previous reports on firearm mortality, the definitions of firearm homicide excluded legal intervention by firearm. In this report, as in others, the definition has been amended to include those deaths. The inclusion of these deaths results in an increase in the overall firearm death rate and the firearm homicide rate with a concomitant decrease in the nonfirearm homicide rate [...] all by relatively small amounts (see appendix table I). For example, adding in deaths coded to legal intervention by a firearm to other firearm homicides among black and white males 2022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 24 years of age increased their respective firearm homicide rates by 1 percent and 3 percent. In 1990, 19, 722 persons 1 - 34 years of age died as a result of a firearm injury. This represented 17. 6 percent of all deaths at those ages. Among young children 10 - 14 years of age, 560 died from a firearm injury, accounting for 1 out of every 8 deaths. Among teenagers 1522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 19 years and young adults 20 - 24 years, 1 of every 4 deaths were by firearm, and for adults 25 - 34 years, 1 of 6 deaths were by firearm. by Lois A. Fingerhut.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} 1979 Census (Ireland, 1979) indicated that the population was nearly 3. 0 per cent greater than had been expected {{on the basis of}} the annual estimates of the population which were issued by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for the years 1972 to 1978. The <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> for the years preceding each of the postwar censuses since 1951 are given in Table 1 from which it will be seen that the percentage error in 1978 was over twice as great as the previous largest error in 1950 and over five times as great as the average error for the years from 1950 to 1970. 1 international comparisons <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> are given by Shryock et al.

These figures and those shown in Table 1 indicate that there has been a significant deterioration in the relia-bility of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s recent postcensal population estimates.

40|$|The central {{challenge}} in robotic mapping is obtaining reliable data associations (or “loop closures”) : state-of-the-art inference algorithms can fail catastrophically if even one erroneous loop closure is {{incorporated into the}} map. Consequently, much {{work has been done}} to push error rates closer to zero. However, a long-lived or multi-robot system will still encounter errors, leading to system failure. We propose a fundamentally different approach: allow richer error models that allow the probability of a failure to be explicitly modeled. In other words, rather than characterizing loop closures as being “right ” or “wrong”, we propose characterizing the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> those loop <b>closures</b> in a more expressive manner that can account for their non-Gaussian behavior. Our approach leads to an fully-integrated Bayesian framework for dealing with error-prone data. Unlike earlier multiple-hypothesis approaches, our approach avoids exponential memory complexity and is fast enough for real-time performance. We show that the proposed method not only allows loop closing errors to be automatically identified, but also that in extreme cases, the “front-end ” loop-validation systems can be unnecessary. We demonstrate our system both on standard benchmarks and on the real-world datasets that motivated this work. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{framework}} <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> enables Lawson to give {{an account}} of the relationship between language and the world that does not rely on reference and which he argues overcomes the problem of how language is hooked onto the world that has beset twentieth century philosophy. One of the consequences of the theory is that philosophical oppositions, between language and the world, fact and value, are no longer regarded as oppositions and instead are seen {{as a consequence of the}} play <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> and openness. As a result, science is not in opposition to art and religion but in a different relationship to openness and closure. Lawson proposes that science is 'driven by the search for closure'. The pursuit <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> cannot however succeed and in the failure <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> openness is uncovered. Art in contrast is described as 'the pursuit of openness and the avoidance of closure'. In turn the pursuit of openness cannot succeed and elements <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> remain.|$|R

First, while ostensibly directed at liberating analysis from all forms <b>of</b> <b>closure,</b> the demi-reg is shown to effectively rely on implied closure.
