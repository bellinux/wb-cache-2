40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The synthesis of a new bisperoxycarbamate based on a reaction between hexamethylene- 1, 6 diisocyanate and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide was undertaken. In addition, {{studies were carried out}} on an earlier research bisperoxycarbamate based on methylene bis(4 -cyclohexylisocyanate) and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. The equation showing the preparation of the new material is shown below: [Equation not shown] The new material - hexamethylene-N,N' bis (tertiary butyl peroxycarbamate) is shown to be able to crosslink a wide range of elastomers, namely -BIIR, NR, SBR, NR/BR, CR, FKM, NBR, Q, ECO, GPO. However, it has been found to give best results in <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> which was examined in further detail. The material is shown to be versatile by using it to cure different grades of <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> (mainly copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene). The physical properties obtained with the new material as curing agent are comparable with those obtained using standard crosslinking agents for fluoroelastomers. Since carbon dioxide is evolved when bisperoxycarbamates are heated, calcium hydroxide was included in most formulations to act as an absorber system. Calcium oxide and magnesium oxide were found to be suitable metallic oxides to react with any acidic gases (such as hydrogen fluoride) evolved during curing of fluoroelastomer compounds. It was ii observed that the state of cure was- poorer when lead oxides were used (e. g. litharge PbO); also, the use of dibasic lead phosphite as acid acceptor appeared to interfere with HBTBP cure. Compounding studies, solvent extraction methods and nitrogen tests, and crosslink density measurements were used to postulate possible routes of crosslink formation. These routes of crosslink formation were based on homolytic decomposition of the bisperoxycarbamate, radical abstraction, interaction of a reactive intermediate, and radical­radical interaction. Additional information was obtained from stress relaxation measurements which indicated that new crosslinks were formed during postcuring of fluorocarbon vulcanizates and that this process continued in the initial stages of heat-ageing of postcured FKM vulcanizates...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here that}} atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) in frictional force mode {{can be used to}} detect onset of chain scission and crosslinking in polymeric and macromolecular samples upon irradiation. A systematic investigation to detect chain scission and crosslinking of two elastomers: (1) Ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubber (EPDM) and (2) <b>Fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> (FKM) upon gamma-ray irradiation has been carried out using frictional force microscopy (FFM). From the AFM results we observed that both the elastomers show a systematic smoothening of its surfaces, as the gamma-ray dose rate increases. However, the frictional property studied using FFM of the sample surfaces show an initial increase and then a decrease as a function of dose rate. This behavior of increase in its frictional property has been attributed to the onset of chain scission and the subsequent decrease in friction has been attributed to the onset of crosslinking of the polymer chains. The evaluated qualitative and semi-quantitative changes observed in the overall frictional property as a function of gamma-ray dose rate for the two elastomers are presented in this paper. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figs include...|$|E
40|$|A {{material}} for a casing packer for service for 24 hours in a geothermal environment was developed by synthesis of new elastomers and formulation of available materials. Formulation included use of commercial elastomer gumstocks and also crosslinking of plastic (high Tg) materials. Fibrous reinforcement of <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubbers</b> was emphasized. Organic fiber reinforcement did not increase hot properties significantly. Glass fiber reinforcement gave significant increase in tensile properties. Elongation was reduced, and the glass-reinforced composition examined so far did not hold up well in the geothermal environment. Colloidal asbestos fibers were also investigated. A few experiments with polyphenyl ether gave material with low tensile and high compression set. Available high styrene SBR compositions were studied. Work to date suggests that new synthetic polymers will be required for service in geothermal environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{potentially}} useful encapsulating materials for Task 3 of the Low-Cost Silicon Solar Array project were studied to identify, evaluate, and recommend encapsulant materials and processes {{for the production}} of cost-effective, long-life solar cell modules. Materials for study were chosen on the basis of existing knowledge of generic chemical types having high resistance to environmental weathering. The materials varied from rubbers to thermoplastics and presented a broad range of mechanical properties and processing requirements. Basic physical and optical properties were measured on the polymers and were redetermined after exposure to indoor artificial accelerated aging conditions covering four time periods. Strengths and weaknesses of the various materials were revealed and data was accumulated for the development of predictive methodologies. To date, silicone <b>rubbers,</b> <b>fluorocarbons,</b> and acrylic polymers appear to have the most promising combination of characteristics. The fluorocarbons may be used only as films, however, because of their high cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a Chemical Compatibility Testing Program {{for the evaluation of}} plastic packaging components which may be used in transporting mixed waste forms. In this program, they have screened 10 plastic materials in four liquid mixed waste simulants. These plastics were butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (Nitrile) rubber, cross-linked polyethylene, epichlorohydrin rubber, ethylene-propylene (EPDM) <b>rubber,</b> <b>fluorocarbons</b> (Viton and Kel-F{trademark}), polytetrafluoro-ethylene (Teflon), high-density polyethylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer (Butyl) rubber, polypropylene, and styrene-butadiene (SBR) rubber. The selected simulant mixed wastes were (1) an aqueous alkaline mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite; (2) a chlorinated hydrocarbon mixture; (3) a simulant liquid scintillation fluid; and (4) a mixture of ketones. The screening testing protocol involved exposing the respective materials to approximately 3 kGy of gamma radiation followed by 14 -day exposures to the waste simulants at 60 C. The rubber materials or elastomers were tested using Vapor Transport Rate measurements while the liner materials were tested using specific gravity as a metric. The authors {{have developed a}} chemical compatibility program for the evaluation of plastic packaging components which may be incorporated in packaging for transporting mixed waste forms. From the data analyses performed to date, they have identified the thermoplastic, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, as having the greatest chemical compatibility after having been exposed to gamma radiation followed by exposure to the Hanford Tank simulant mixed waste. The most striking observation from this study was the poor performance of polytetrafluoroethylene under these conditions. In the evaluation of the two elastomeric materials they have concluded that while both materials exhibit remarkable resistance to these environmental conditions, EPDM has a greater resistance to this corrosive simulant mixed waste...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} rubber {{material}} {{for use in}} sealings and hoses in the fuel system is of great importance. If a wrong type of rubber is used, premature failure during service may occur. This impacts the environmental performance, the safety during driving, uptime and economy of the transport. In this diploma work, rubbers for use in sealing and hoses in the fuel system have been evaluated to assess which materials {{have the potential to}} be used under long-term use in contact with commercial fuels.   Three commercial fuel hoses, nitrile rubber (NBR), hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR), ethylene-acrylic rubber (AEM) and <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> (FKM) of varying types and compositions have been evaluated in diesel with 7 % RME (rapeseed methyl ester), 100 % biodiesel of RME and ethanol fuel. Tests were performed by immersing the materials in fuel and measure the compression set and changes in properties like volume, hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break.   The results showed that one NBR material, one AEM and all FKM are potential materials for long term use in diesel with 7 % RME. All types of NBR and two types of FKM (terpolymers, peroxide cured) may be used in ethanol fuel. NBR and HNBR were the only rubbers evaluated in biodiesel. NBR and HNBR with an ACN content of ~ 30 % might be used in 100 % RME at lower temperatures for shorter periods. The aging resistance in air was good for HNBR, AEM and FKM but poor for NBR.

40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of several elastomers {{have been studied}} during reciprocating sliding conditions when lubricated with uncontaminated environmentally adapted lubricants and the same lubricants contaminated with moisture. The elastomers studied are Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR), Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (HNBR), and <b>Fluorocarbon</b> <b>Rubber</b> (FKM). The lubricants used are complex ester and polyol ester as well as both aged and non-aged polyol esters with 5 % water content. Experiments were conducted using a Cameron-Plint test rig with a steel cylinder sliding in the longitudinal direction with a reciprocating motion against a curved elastomer specimen to avoid any edge contact. Sliding velocities were maintained low to reduce the thermal effects often associated with elastomer friction. In these tests, HNBR resulted in the lowest friction, with NBR the highest. The NBR specimens most often experienced wear, while FKM and HNBR experienced very little wear. The various oils, with some exceptions, had similar friction performance both at the higher and the lower loads. Experiments were also conducted using an SRV Optimol test rig at higher frequencies with a steel cylinder in contact with an elastomer mounted on a steel disc. The results from the SRV test rig differed significantly {{with those of the}} Cameron-Plint rig with FKM resulting the greatest wear and NBR producing minimal wear. This difference was primarily caused by the differences in contact geometry and the operating parameters between the tests.

40|$|The oxygen {{compatibility}} of six polymers used in oxygen {{service was}} evaluated after exposure for 48 hours to oxygen pressures ranging from 350 to 6200 kPa (50 to 900 psia), and temperatures ranging from 50 to 250 C (122 to 302 F). Three elastomers were tested: CR rubber (C 873 - 70), FKM <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> (Viton A), and MPQ silicone rubber (MIL-ZZ- 765, Class 2); and three thermoplastics were tested: polyhexamethylene adipamide (Zytel 42), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon TFE), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (Neoflon CTFE M 400 H). Post-aging changes in mass, dimensions, tensile strength, elongation at break, and durometer hardness were determined. Also, the compression set was determined {{for the three}} elastomers. Results show that the properties under investigation were more sensitive to oxygen pressure at low to moderate temperatures, and more sensitive to temperature at low to moderate oxygen pressures. Inspection of the results also suggested that both chain scissioning and cross-linking processes were operative, consistent with heterogeneous oxidation. Attempts are underway to verify conclusively the occurrence of heterogeneous oxidation using a simple modulus profiling technique. Finally, the effect of aging at 620 kpa (90 psia) and 121 C (250 F) on ignition and combustion resistance was determined. As expected, aged polymers were less ignitable and combustible (had higher AlTs and lower heats of combustion). Special attention was given to Neoflon CTFE. More specifically, the effect of process history (compression versus extrusion molding) and percent crystallinity (quick- versus slow-quenched) on the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity of Neoflon CTFE was investigated. Results show the AIT, heat of combustion, and impact sensitivity to be essentially independent of Neoflon CTFE process history and structure...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{jet fuels}} have been {{proposed}} as alternatives to petroleum Jet A- 1. Compatibility issues, however, are of concern; specifically the interaction of synthetic fuels with polymeric materials which are commonly used to seal fuel systems. This is because of differences between the composition of synthetic fuels and petroleum-derived fuels. Synthetic fuel streams contain no or very low aromatics, unlike petroleum-derived fuels. This investigation was consequently initiated to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the factors affecting seal swell in the aviation industry. The study focussed interactions between fuel components from various fuel classes and nitrile rubber (NBR) as well as a restricted set of investigations on <b>fluorocarbon</b> (FKM) <b>rubber.</b> No comprehensive study of the temperature sensitivity of fuel composition on swelling has been attempted prior to this study. NBR and FKM were swollen in petroleum Jet A- 1, synthesised paraffinic kerosene (SPK) and a variety of blends of pure components with SPK. These components were selected from aromatic species (monoaromatic, diaromatic and heterocyclic), cycloparaffins, aromatic oxygenates and other oxygenates. Aromatic species were blended at 8 % (v/v) while all other species were blended at 15 % (v/v). Within the class of aromatic hydrocarbon components, it was found that decreasing molecular size, increasing the number of ring structures (particular aromatic rings) as well as increasing all Hansen solubility parameters increased swelling. Of the Hansen solubility parameters, the greatest correlation was found with the hydrogen-bonding (electron exchange) parameter. Nonetheless the dispersion parameter which is strongly affected by the number of aromatic rings and length of any aliphatic side-chain was also important. A very good correlation was found between swelling and the density of the aromatic species. It was found furthermore that introducing oxygen atoms increased swelling. The introduction of cycloparaffins also increase swelling although to a much lesser extent than aromatics. Cyclisation together with a polar moiety was observed to increase swell significantly. With FKM elastomers, fuel composition had less influence. Temperature sensitivity was explored by performing swelling at 20 oC, 35 oC and 50 oC. Van't Hoff plots were used to obtain enthalpies of mixing. It was found that all hydrocarbons swelled more as temperature rose. This is indicative of endothermic interactions between these species and polar NBR. However, it was observed that species with high polar and hydrogenbonding Hansen solubility parameters had lower sensitivity to temperature. It is postulated that in these species, less aromatic concentration in the NBR occurs at elevated temperatures, contributing to lower sensitivities. Aromatic oxygenates were observed to decrease in swelling with temperature. This is ascribed to a strong exothermic interaction. This behaviour was in contrast to non-aromatic oxygenates. It is possible that blends of these non-aromatic oxygenates with SPK are less stable at elevated temperatures leading to component separation into the NBR and thus more swelling. Similar trends were observed with fluorocarbon elastomers (FKM). Physical property measurements were made on swollen NBR O-rings. A distinct relationship between decreased glass transition temperature and the extent of swelling was observed. Fuel which had adsorbed into the elastomer was observed to act as an effective plasticiser. Not only did increased swelling lower the glass transition temperature but it reduced the modulus of NBR O-rings in a predictable fashion. A significant decrease in storage modulus was associated with increased swelling. Increased swelling was found to be associated with increased compression set although the mechanism by which this manifests itself is unclear...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of several elastomers are investigated under sliding contact lubricated by environmentally adapted lubricants {{with varying degrees}} of contamination. The elastomers studied are flat strips of Nitrile Butadiene rubber (NBR), Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (HNBR), and <b>Fluorocarbon</b> <b>Rubber</b> (FKM) and O-Rings of both molded and extruded NBR and FKM. The lubricants used are uncontaminated Complex Ester and Polyolester as well as both Aged and Un-Aged Polyolesters with 5 % Water Content as well as a commercial synthetic based turbine oil and a commercial mineral oil based turbine oil. Initial experiments were conducted using a Cameron-Plint test rig with a steel cylinder sliding in the longitudinal direction with a reciprocating motion against a curved elastomer specimen to avoid any edge contact. Sliding velocities were maintained low to reduce the thermal effects often associated with elastomer friction. The results from these experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the different elastomers with the various lubricants and load configurations. Further testing was conducted using the Cameron-Plint machine with O-ring material sliding against flat steel plates results of which validated the use of synthetic ester in lieu of mineral base oils in the case of sealing surfaces of proper roughness and found that extruded NBR performed best of the tested materials. Experiments were also conducted using an SRV Optimol test rig at higher frequencies with a steel cylinder in contact with an elastomer disc. The results from the SRV test rig conflicted significantly with those of the Cameron-Plint rig due to the differences in contact geometry of the tests. Other experiments conducted using an Abrasive Test machine which reciprocated a steel ring against elastomer specimens produced no worthwhile results other than demonstrating the durability of the elastomer specimens when operating in the elasto- hydrodynamic lubrication regime.

40|$|The Office of Waste Processing, {{within the}} Office of Technology Innovation and Development, funded the {{development}} of an enhanced Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) solvent for deployment at the Savannah River Site for removal of cesium from High Level Waste. This effort lead to {{the development of}} the Next Generation Solvent (NGS) with Tris (3, 7 -dimethyl octyl) guanidine (TiDG). The first deployment target for the NGS solvent is within the Modular CSSX Unit (MCU). Deployment of a new chemical within an existing facility requires verification that the new chemical components are compatible with the installed equipment. In the instance of a new organic solvent, the primary focus is on compatibility of the solvent with organic polymers used in the affected facility. This report provides the calculated data from exposing these polymers to the Next Generation Solvent. An assessment of the dimensional stability of polymers known to be used or present in the MCU, Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), and Saltstone facilities that will be exposed to the NGS showed that TiDG could selectively affect the elastomers and some thermoplastics to varying extents, but the typical use of these polymers in a confined geometry will likely prevent the NGS from impacting component performance. The polymers identified as of primary concern include Grafoil® (flexible graphite), Tefzel®, Isolast®, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), and <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>rubber</b> (FKM). Certain polymers like NBR and EPDM were found to interact mildly with NGS but their calculated swelling and the confined geometry will impede interaction with NGS. In addition, it was found that Vellumoid (cellulose fibers-reinforced glycerin and protein) may leach protein and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) may leach plasticizer (such as Bis-Ethylhexyl-Phthalates) into the NGS solvent. Either case will not impact decontamination or immobilization operations at Savannah River Site (SRS). Some applications have zero tolerance for dimensional changes such as the operation of valves while other applications a finite dimensional change improves the function of the application such as seals and gaskets. Additional considerations are required before using the conclusions from this work to judge outcomes in field applications. Decane, a component of IsoparL that is most likely to interact with the polymers, mildly interacted with the elastomers and the propylene based polymers but their degree of swelling is at most 10 % and the confined geometry that they are typically placed in indicate this is not significant. In addition, it was found that Vellumoid may leach protein into the NGS solvent. Since Vellumoid is used at the mixer in Saltstone where it sees minimum quantities of solvent, this leaching has no effect on the extraction process at MCU or the immobilization process at saltstone. No significant interaction is expected between MaxCalix and the polymers and elastomers used at MCU, DWPF, and Saltstone. Overall, minimal and insignificant interactions are expected on extraction and immobilization operations when MCU switches from CSSX to NGS solvent. It is expected that contacting NGS will not accelerate the aging rate of polymers and elastomers under radiation and heat. This is due to the minimal interaction between NGS and the polymers and the confined geometries for these polymers. SRNL recommends the use of the HSP method (for screening) and some testing to evaluate the impact of other organic such as alcohols, glycolate, and their byproducts on the polymers used throughout the site...|$|E
