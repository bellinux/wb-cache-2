Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would <b>ever</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E

In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} of July, Davis had three home runs robbed from him, {{more than any other}} Major Leaguer the entire year. On July 28 against the Atlanta Braves, Davis hit two home runs and drove in 5 runs. It was his tenth career multi-home run game and third of the 2015 season. On July 30, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his 25th home run of the year, which {{happened}} to be his 83rd career home run at Oriole Park, which gave him sole possession of 6th place on the stadium's all-time home run list. On August 5, Davis hit his sixth career grand slam and second of the season in the tenth inning in a game against the Oakland Athletics, which helped lift Baltimore to a 7-3 victory. Ten days later, Davis hit a walk-off solo home run against the A's in Baltimore. It was his second home run of the night and number thirty-four on the year. On September 3, Davis hit a walk off solo home run to help the O's end a six-game losing skid. It was his thirty-eighth of the year. It was also his 152nd with the Orioles, giving him sole possession of eleventh place on the franchise's all-time list. The home run also happened to be his 90th career home run at OPACY, now giving him sole possession of fourth on the stadium's all-time list. On September 4, Davis became the first Orioles player to have back-to-back multi-home run games since 2009. In addition, he became the first Orioles player ever with multiple 40-home-run seasons (hit 53 in 2013). That game, against Toronto, became his sixth multi-homer game of the year and the thirteenth of his career. Davis led the majors in home runs with 47. This made Davis the only Orioles hitter to <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> two seasons with 40+ homers (53 in 2013 & 47 in 2015).|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} {{mammography}} screening experience and {{factors related to}} utilization were examined in six towns serviced by physician staffs at five hospitals. Data were collected via random digit dial telephone interview of a probability sample of 1184 women, aged 45 - 75 years. The results showed that 55 % of the women reported <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> had a mammogram. Of those who <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a mammogram, 21 % reported that the mammogram {{in the past year}} was their first one. Of those women who are over 50 and <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a mammogram, 57 % reported one in the past year. Analyses demonstrated that a combination of demographic factors, certain beliefs and knowledge, having a regular physician, social interaction and media exposure are independently related to <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> a mammogram, and to having one in the past year. Despite anecdotal and empirical evidence that the proportion of women <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> had a mammogram has substantially increased in the past several years, increasing utilization among older and lower-income women provides a challenge for public health...|$|R
