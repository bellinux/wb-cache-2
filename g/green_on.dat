5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. <b>Green</b> <b>on</b> some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} made {{possible}} when the government introduced the Trade Facilities Act, 1921 by which the Treasury underwrote loans for public works {{as a means of}} alleviating unemployment.

5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in <b>green</b> <b>on</b> the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling <b>Green</b> <b>on</b> August 26. Because {{of his age}} and ill health, he made {{no more than one}} speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing {{at either end}} of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog <b>Green</b> <b>on</b> the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E

5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is a vulnerable species whereas C. herbacea is much more common. This has previously led to the misidentification of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent <b>green</b> <b>on</b> dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis. There is a smooth lip running only half {{the length of the}} ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on C. graminis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{appearing}} 24 {{times for}} Gateshead {{during the opening}} half of the 2012–13 season, although eight of which were as a substitute, Odubade was loaned to Conference National side Forest Green Rovers on 17 January 2013, {{for the remainder of}} the campaign. He made his debut on 19 January as a second-half substitute against Stockport County, a game in which Forest Green lost 2–1. He scored his first goal for Forest <b>Green</b> <b>on</b> 12 March 2013 in a 2–1 win over Southport. It proved to be his only goal during his time at Forest Green, making 14 appearances, all of which in the league. Odubade returned to Gateshead following the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, and was told he was one of seven players released by the club in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{disappointed}} by the new contract offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one-year contract. He made his debut in a 3–1 home victory over Forest <b>Green</b> <b>on</b> 14 August 2010, {{the opening day of}} 2010–11, and his first goal came from a close range header as Mansfield beat Eastbourne Borough 4–0 at home on 25 September. He was Mansfield's stand-in captain for a 1–1 away draw with Gateshead on 2 October 2010. However, after Mansfield signed defenders Rhys Day and Simon Grand, Smith became surplus to requirements and was made available on loan.|$|E

We also recorded the abundance of large teleost reef fishes during all counts.
