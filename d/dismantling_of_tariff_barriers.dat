The stepwise <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> vis-à-vis Tunisia’s main trading partner without encountering major disruptions {{in the domestic}} market is a significant achievement. But now a new challenge looms. In order to achieve the economic growth rates of 6. 1 percent {{that the country is}} aspiring to in its 11 th Development Plan, policy makers and private sector operators will have to shift from a stance that is focused on defending domestic interests against import competition to an offensive strategy that enables Tunisian exporters to take part and benefit from dynamically evolving global markets. Indeed, strengthening Tunisia’s export performance is a major challenge and requires attention to the incentives that actual and potential exporters face, the efficiency of service providers in the economy, and the effectiveness of trade support institutions that help private sector firms to discover and exploit international market opportunities. ...|$|R

The model captures the multistage nature of the wool production system, and the heterogeneous nature of raw wool, processed wool and wool garments.

We illustrate the utility of the model by estimating the effects <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>barriers</b> on wool products using partial- and general-equilibrium solutions.
