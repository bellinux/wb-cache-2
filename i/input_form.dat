Syli is specially aimed for situations where a single DSpace instance is shared by several organizations by giving each organization enough administration rights to manage their own collection, users and workflows. Currently DSpace instances shared by several organizations have some problems, including: - Some configurations are defined instance wide which leads to sub-optimal settings for each organization. - Defining <b>input</b> <b>forms</b> and their localizations requires editing files on a server and restarting DSpace. - Fetching unique identifiers automatically for each item from external systems is difficult. - <b>Input</b> <b>forms</b> for all collections are defined in one file which makes administration difficult. - User management is difficult: Only main administrators are able to create and modify groups. Additionally, the logic how collections and groups are related might not be clear {{for those people who}} are not familiar with Dspace. - One has to define workflows for each collection: there is no inheritance. - One has to have an access to the file system in the server to edit any menu in the <b>input</b> <b>forms.</b> The aim of the Syli is to alleviate these problems.

5000|$|An {{increasingly}} common and versatile measure of organizational learning is an organizational learning curve demonstrating experience curve effects. A learning curve measures {{the rate of}} a metric of learning relative to a metric for experience. Researcher Linda Argote explains that [...] "large increases in productivity typically occur as organizations gain experience in production." [...] However, Argote also notes that organizations' rates of learning vary. Argote identifies three factors that affect these rates: increased proficiency of individuals, improvements in an organization's technology, and improvements in its structure (such as its routines and methods of coordination). [...] Some organizations show great productivity gains while others show little or no gains, given {{the same amount of}} experience.The experience curves in Fig 1 plot the decreasing unit cost versus the total cumulative units produced, a common way to measure the effect of experience. The linear-linear <b>input</b> <b>form</b> on the left is transformed into the log-log form on the right to demonstrate that the proficiency increase correlates with experience.|$|E

Some website design websites provided free ready-made blogging scripts, where all the user had to do was input her content into a template. An example of this kind of application is My Blog. At the same time, a personal web presence became easier with the increased popularity of social networking services, some with blogging platforms such as LiveJournal and Blogger. These websites provided an attractive and easy-to-use content management system for regular users. Most of the early personal websites were Web 1.0 style, in which a static display of text and images or photos was displayed to individuals who came to the page. About the only interaction that was possible on these early websites was signing the virtual [...] "guestbook".|$|E

40|$|One {{criterion}} in {{the design}} of binaural sound scenes in audio production {{is the extent to which}} the intended speech message is correctly understood. Object-based audio broadcasting systems have permitted sound editors to gain more access to the metadata (e. g., intensity and location) of each sound source, providing better control over speech intelligibility. The current study describes and evaluates a binaural distortion-weighted glimpse proportion metric [...] BiDWGP [...] which is motivated by better-ear glimpsing and binaural masking level differences. BiDWGP predicts intelligibility from two alternative input forms: either binaural recordings or monophonic recordings from each sound source along with their locations. Two listening experiments were performed with stationary noise and competing speech, one in the presence of a single masker, the other with multiple maskers, for a variety of spatial conﬁgurations. Overall, BiDWGP with both <b>input</b> <b>forms</b> predicts listener keyword scores with correlations of 0. 95 and 0. 91 for single- and multi-masker conditions, respectively. When considering masker type separately, correlations rise to 0. 95 and above for both types of maskers. Predictions using the two <b>input</b> <b>forms</b> are very similar, suggesting that BiDWGP can be applied to the design of sound scenes where only individual sound sources and their locations are available...|$|R
