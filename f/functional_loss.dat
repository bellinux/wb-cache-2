25|$|Current {{guidelines}} {{are based on}} data for OPC as a whole, so that patients are generally being treated regardless of HPV status, yet many clinicians and researchers are considering deintensification. It is likely that treatment of this condition will continue to evolve {{in the direction of}} deintensification, in order to minimize loss of function but maintain disease control. In the absence of specific clinical trials and guidelines, patient preferences need to be taken into consideration to minimise short and long term toxicity and <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> and optimize quality of life, given the prolonged survival frequently seen. This may involve exploring patients' values regarding trade-offs of disease control against adverse effects of treatment. Patients who have received CRT as primary treatment for OPC place a high value on survival, and although agreeing that deintensification is desirable, were reluctant to trade off much survival advantage for lower toxicity, though {{would be more likely to}} forgo chemotherapy than accept reduced radiation.|$|E
25|$|But many HPV+OPC {{present with}} {{involvement}} of the lymph nodes in the neck, and hence a higher stage of disease, generally referred to as locally advanced disease. This group is mostly treated with multimodality therapy, {{with the exception of}} one of the more favourable subgroups with small primary tumours and lymph node involvement confined to a single node no larger than 3nbsp&cm in size, which as noted are considered early stage disease. The three main options for locally advanced but operable disease are resection, neck dissection and adjuvant therapy; chemoradiation (with possible salvage surgery); induction chemotherapy followed by radiation or chemoradiation. However the last option has not been supported in clinical trials that tested it. The primary consideration of surgery for locally advanced disease is to obtain adequate negative margins and spare the patient postoperative chemoradiation. But this must be balanced against the morbidity and <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> from extensive resection, particularly where the tongue base is involved. To avoid such morbidity, primary chemoradiation is preferred. The management of disease within the cervical lymph nodes has to be taken into account in treating locally advanced disease. Guidelines for all OPC dictate that ectracapsular extension be given postoperative chemoradiation. Where gross neck disease is evident initially primary chemoradiation is usually given.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through {{the neck and}} splitting of the jaw bone, {{which resulted in a}} considerable risk of death. Later, radiotherapy with or without the addition of chemotherapy, provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth have improved outcomes, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence, management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> and the persons preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck, without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of tonsil tissue from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with a better response to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk of dying from the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival. While most head and neck cancer has been declining with reduced smoking rates, HPV+OPC has been increasing. Compared to HPV-OPC patients, HPV+OPC patients tend to be younger, have a higher socioeconomic status and are less likely to smoke. In addition they tend to have smaller tumours, but {{are more likely to have}} involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC. The increase is seen particularly in young men in developed countries, and HPV+OPC now accounts for the majority of all OPC cases.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study aims to {{determine}} whether visual evoked potentials can aid the diagnosis of <b>functional</b> visual <b>loss</b> and differentiate it from optic neuritis in children. The medical records and visual evoked potentials of 72 patients registered in the neurophysiological database of our Institution in the period 2000 - 2009, with diagnoses of <b>functional</b> visual <b>loss</b> or optic neuritis were reviewed retrospectively. In 61 children, visual evoked potentials confirmed the diagnosis: 49 <b>functional</b> visual <b>loss</b> and 12 optic neuritis. Visual evoked potentials were normal in all patients but 1 in the <b>functional</b> visual <b>loss</b> group, while all were abnormal in the optic neuritis group. Overlapping clinical features occurred between the 2 {{groups as well as}} prevalent severe visual loss, relative afferent pupillary defect, and papillitis in optic neuritis.

40|$|Introduction: Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is an X-linked {{genetic disease}} which almost {{exclusively}} affects males. The disease presents a multisystem form, {{caused by the}} progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in tissues and organs. It causes developmental delays resulting in limitations {{on the performance of}} day-to-day activities. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} identify occupational performance areas in which people with MPS II have greater impairment and analyze their family’s socioeconomic profile. Method: The research was done through interviews with an individual responsible for three adolescent brothers, (A 1 - 19 years, A 2 - 16 years and A 3 - 15 years) who are MPS II carriers from Alagoas, Brazil. Data collection was performed by a trained professional using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) as a questionnaire to identify the <b>functional</b> <b>losses</b> and the ABEP for socioeconomic profile analysis. Results: The results showed that the family is included in the C 1 socioeconomic class. Among the siblings, A 1 presents total dependence on the investigated skills; A 2 presents the most disabling <b>functional</b> <b>losses</b> requiring moderate assistance and A 3 has much of his physical and cognitive skills preserved, but has modified dependence. Conclusion: Taking into consideration the difficulties identified in this study, we highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and rehabilitation therapies combined with enzyme therapy, which can delay disease progression...|$|R

The <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> of aSMase activity may also be due to altered trafficking (causing accumulation of cholesterol) or by direct action on the enzyme.

40|$|AbstractDomination of cell {{proliferation}} over cell {{death is a}} driving force for carcinogenesis, whereas reduced {{cell proliferation}} and increased cell death are characteristic of ageing. We employed published data to estimate representative mean values of cell turnover times for 31 different organs and tissues in adult humans and animals (when data in humans were lacking) as well as <b>functional</b> mass <b>loss</b> for 5 organs, accounting for actual mass loss and tissue conversion to fat, in humans over the adult period, age 25 to 70. We found that greater actual and <b>functional</b> mass <b>loss</b> was significantly associated (P= 0. 001 and P< 0. 0001, respectively) with the log of shorter cell turnover times. We propose that this is characteristic of stem cell exhaustion and replicative senescence. In addition, we provide quantitative evidence that, in many organs, involution is evident even in young adults. On the basis of published mass measurements of major organs, by analysis of covariance, we identified examples of significant (P≤ 0. 05), accelerated actual or <b>functional</b> mass <b>loss</b> and ageing from early to late adulthood. We hypothesise and quantitatively demonstrate that <b>functional</b> mass <b>loss</b> accelerates with ageing by incorporating the contribution of actual mass loss, tissue conversion to fatty or fibrous tissue, {{and the presence of}} apoptotic, necrotic and senescent cells. We propose that mass loss, linked to replicative senescence, is an evolutionary adaptation that effectively limits cancer in young adults, as mass loss is first apparent soon {{after the end of the}} growth period, accelerating in the more elderly as biological conditions deviate away from those prevailing in youth, when the selective pressure on pleiotropic genes is greatest...|$|R

50|$|A {{commonly}} used nerve for autotransplantation is the sural nerve {{in the upper}} leg. Unfortunately, this treatment does have some disadvantages. First, {{there is a risk}} of donor site morbidity and <b>functional</b> <b>loss.</b> Secondly, patients have an increased risk of symptomatic neuroma formation. Thirdly, a longer anaesthesia time is needed because of the additional surgical site for the donor nerve. Lastly, higher costs also due to the extra surgical site.

50|$|It must {{be stated}} {{at the outset}} that the risk(s) related to loss of {{skeletal}} muscle mass, strength, and endurance depends not only on the level of loss but also on the starting point and the relative physiologic expense required to successfully complete a requisite set of tasks within a fixed period. Thus, a crewmember must be capable of completing a task before being exposed to microgravity, the amount of <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> cannot be allowed to fall below the level needed to successfully complete all assigned tasks, and the physical performance requirements for completion of the tasks should be known. Without information relating to the physical performance requirements of tasks, {{it is not possible to}} determine the risk of failure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>functional</b> <b>loss</b> of {{this gene}} after the {{divergence}} of humans {{from the great}} apes leads to several possible implications for its role in human development, the most notable of which being less constrained brain growth. In most mammals, CMAH expression is down-regulated {{in the brain and}} in fact, when higher expression of cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase is forced in mouse brains, it proves lethal. Human brains are different from most primate brains in that they continue to grow for some time postnatally, unlike primate brains that stop growing soon after birth. It is therefore possible that even the small amounts of Neu5Gc present in most mammalian brains could be inhibiting their brain growth; losing the CMAH gene may have released the human brain from this constraint.|$|E
