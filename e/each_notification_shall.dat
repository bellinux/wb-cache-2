40|$|Remote Memory Access (RMA) {{programming}} enables {{direct access}} to low-level hardware features to achieve high performance for distributed-memory programs. However, the design of RMA programming schemes focuses on the memory access and less on the synchronization. For example, in contemporary RMA programming systems, the widely used producer-consumer pattern can only be implemented inefficiently, incurring in an overhead of an additional round-trip message. We propose Notified Access, a scheme where the target process of an access can receive a completion notification. This scheme enables direct and efficient synchronization with a minimum number of messages. We implement our scheme in an open source MPI- 3 RMA library and demonstrate lower overheads (two cache misses) than other point-to-point synchronization mechanisms for <b>each</b> <b>notification.</b> We also evaluate our implementation on three real-world benchmarks, a stencil computation, a tree computation, and a Colicky factorization implemented with tasks. Our scheme always performs better than traditional message passing and other existing RMA synchronization schemes, providing up to 50 % speedup on small messages. Our analysis shows that Notified Access is a valuable primitive for any RMA system. Furthermore, we provide guidance {{for the design of}} low-level network interfaces to support Notified Access efficiently...|$|R

METHOD: A notifying card for adverse reactions possibly produced by psychoactive medications was quarterly sent to all psychiatrists affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Psychiatry. Once <b>each</b> <b>notification,</b> dully filled in, was received, the possible adverse reaction was analyzed {{in order to}} verify the causality RESULTS: The psychiatrists classified as severe 50 of the ARPMs; 150 others were not considered as severe. Among the severe ones there were 3 deaths, 12 life-threatening reactions, 26 ARPMs required or prolonged hospitalization and 9 notifications described temporary disability of the patients. Among the medications, antidepressants ranked first with 122 ARPMs being notified, followed by neuroleptics (46 ARPMs) and antiepiletic medicaments (25 ARPMs). The three main organs and systems affected by the ARs were the Central Nervous System with 102 ARs, skin and mucosa with 44 and gastrointestinal with 21 ARPMs. CONCLUSION: Considering causality, i. e., the association between the medication and the described AR, 24 cases were considered as Definite (with positive dechallenge and rechallenge, i. e., withdrawal and reintroduction of the medication) and 134 other ARPMs were classified as Probable (only dechallenge positive; only with medication withdrawal; rechallenge was not performed) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pharmacovigilance is {{a public}} health for the identification, {{evaluation}} and prevention of risks associated with drugs once marketed. They constitute a major health problem in fact in some developed countries adverse drug reactions that lead to admission to emergency services constitute {{a major cause of}} death, preceded only by ischemic heart disease, cancer and stroke. Our research suggested the study of the behavior of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the intensive therapy unit (ICU) of the Hospital Calixto García from the year 2000 to 2005. Method: A study of Pharmacovigilance Hospital retrospective and descriptive using the methods of notification Spontaneous adverse reactions and intensive monitoring of patients admitted to the service of intensive therapy unit of University Hospital "General Calixto García Iñiguez" of Havana which consisted in the analysis of adverse drug reactions reported in the period from 2000 until 2005. Results: We detected 277 adverse drug reactions in 119 notifications of patients. The drug associated with an increased number of notifications recombinant streptokinase was 61. 3 %. More than 50 % of RAM detected affected systems: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, general declarations. Predominated moderate adverse reactions (43. 3 %) although the grave were present in addition 36. 8 % 3 fatal cases (1. 08 %) 86. 3 % of them were classified as probable. Conclusions: Were detected between two or three adverse drug reactions for <b>each</b> <b>notification.</b> Leaving clear the high responsibility for selecting treatment in these patients, streptokinase was the drug most commonly associated with adverse reactions reported, the digestive system was the most affected and adverse reactions that predominated were moderate and probable.

40|$|Background : The {{treatment}} used {{to combat}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is multidrug; {{therefore it is}} important to use active pharmacovigilance to detect, assess and analyze the likely adverse reactions which may occur during the same period. Objective: To determine the frequency of adverse reactions to chemotherapeutic drugs in children with ALL. Material and Methods : Intensive pharmacovigilance was used to record the reports of adverse reactions to vincristine, L-asparaginase and the vincristine-L-asparaginase combination in children with ALL in a paediatric hospital. For <b>each</b> <b>notification,</b> the adverse reactions were analyzed in order to verify causality. Results: Forty patients were evaluated. Twenty children were female (50. 0 %) and 20 were male (50 %). The children had a mean age, weight and height (±standard deviation: SD) of 8. 1 (± 3. 4) years, 31. 4 (± 13. 9) kg and 1. 3 (± 0. 2) m, respectively. Vincristine was administered to 19 patients, vincristine plus L-asparaginase were given to 19 patients and only 2 patients used L-asparaginase. One-hundred-ninety adverse reactions were detected in the patients, with an average (±SD) of 4. 8 (± 2. 6). Ondansetron was the drug administered fo r the treating of nausea and vomiting. One hundred eighty- one (95. 3 %) adverse reactions were identified as “definite”, 5 (2. 6 %) as “probable” and 4 (2. 1 %) as “doubtful”. Conclusions: There is a high incidence of adverse reactions by the administration of vincristine and L-asparaginase; the reactions of highest incidence were: nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, constipation, mucositis, headache, and abdominal pain. It is important to promote the detection, collection, reporting, assessment and treatment of ARD’s in children. It is necessary to promote the conduct further studies on pharmacovigilance with this type of treatments and to increase the duration of the studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{integration}} of event information from diverse event notification sources is, as with meta-searching over heterogeneous search engines, a challenging task. Due {{to the complexity}} of event filter languages, known solutions for heterogeneous searching cannot be applied for event notification In this paper, we propose the concept and design of a Meta Service for Event Notification. We define transformation rules for exchanging event filter definitions and event notifications between various event services and sources. We transform each filter defined at a meta-service into a filter expressed in the language of <b>each</b> event <b>notification</b> source. Due to unavoidable asymmetry in the semantics of different langues, some superfluous information may be delivered to the meta-service. These notifications are then post-processed {{to reduce the number of}} spurious messages. We present a survey and classification of filter languages for event notification, which serves as basis for the transformation rules. The proposed rules are implemented in a prototype transformation module for a Meta Service for Event Notification. ...|$|R
