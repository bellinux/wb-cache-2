500|$|According to the Mishnah (Middot 1:3), a {{compendium}} of oral teachings received and compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in 189 CE, only one gate {{on the western side}} of the Temple Mount was actually in use and [...] "served <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> and for going out," [...] namely, the Kiponus Gate. The other gates, presumably, had been sealed earlier. It is of singular importance that Josephus notes that of the gates built into the western enclosure of the Temple Mount, there was a bridge that also ascended to one of these gates and which same bridge was broken-off by the insurgents during their war with Rome, most likely the bridge leading to the only serviceable gate.|$|E

I don’t care about anything except <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs.

He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted {{something}} of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time.|$|E
