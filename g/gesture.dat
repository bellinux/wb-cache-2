5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual <b>gesture</b> found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out <b>gesture</b> is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out <b>gesture,</b> the crossed fingers <b>gesture</b> remains common.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle finger}} <b>gesture</b> {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the <b>gesture.</b> It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the <b>gesture</b> may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making <b>gesture,</b> or a blessing <b>gesture</b> in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the <b>gesture</b> of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365.

40|$|When we speak, we spontaneously produce <b>gestures</b> (co-speech <b>gestures).</b> Co-speech <b>gestures</b> {{and speech}} {{production}} are closely interlinked. However, {{the exact nature}} of the link is still under debate. To addressed the question that whether co-speech <b>gestures</b> originate from the speech production system or from a system independent of the speech production, the present study examined the relationship between co-speech and co-thought <b>gestures.</b> Co-thought <b>gestures,</b> produced during silent thinking without speaking, presumably originate from a system independent of the speech production processes. We found a positive correlation between the production frequency of co-thought and co-speech <b>gestures,</b> regardless the communicative function that co-speech <b>gestures</b> might serve. Therefore, we suggest that co-speech <b>gestures</b> and co-thought <b>gestures</b> originate from a common system that is independent of the speech production processe...|$|R
40|$|Can <b>gestures</b> alter thought? Thinking {{about time}} is deeply {{interlinked}} with actions in space, and <b>gestures</b> are abstracted actions. Four experiments showed that <b>gestures</b> alter thinking about time.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{development}} of <b>gestures</b> have examined <b>gestures</b> in infants. In recent years, together with the rise of interest in spontaneous <b>gestures</b> accompanied by speech, research on spontaneous <b>gestures</b> in preschool-age children has increased. But little has been reported in terms of systematic developmental changes in children's spontaneous <b>gestures,</b> especially with respect to preschool-age children. The present paper surveys domestic and international research on the development of spontaneous <b>gestures</b> in preschoolers. When <b>gestures</b> seen in infants and preschool-age and older children were categorized, it was found that spontaneous <b>gestures</b> begin to appear together with speech semantically and temporarily {{by the end of the}} one-word period; during this same period, <b>gestures</b> that were seen earlier gradually decrease. It is suggested that the development of spontaneous <b>gestures</b> relates to a sentence level, not to a vocabulary level. Based on growth point theory (McNeill, 1992), it is also argued that spontaneous <b>gestures</b> develop with “thinking for speaking” and symbol ability...|$|R

5000|$|Other hand {{movements}} {{are considered to}} be <b>gestures.</b> They are movements with specific, conventionalized meanings called symbolic <b>gestures.</b> Familiar symbolic <b>gestures</b> include the [...] "raised fist," [...] "bye-bye," [...] and [...] "thumbs up." [...] In contrast to adapters, symbolic <b>gestures</b> are used intentionally and serve a clear communicative function. Every culture has their own set of <b>gestures,</b> some of which are unique only to a specific culture. Very similar <b>gestures</b> can have very different meanings across cultures. Symbolic <b>gestures</b> are usually used in the absence of speech, but can also accompany speech.|$|R
40|$|One {{study found}} that {{observers}} retained more information from hand <b>gestures</b> that speakers gazed at, possibly because speaker-gaze shifted observers' attention covertly. Speaker-gaze may thus modulate the role of <b>gestures</b> in communication. One hypothesized communicative function of <b>gestures,</b> and specifically of the inter-personal repetition of <b>gestures,</b> is to facilitate {{the process of creating}} common ground (grounding). Therefore, speaker-gaze may also influence the inter-personal repetition of <b>gestures.</b> In an experimental study, we found that participants were more likely to repeat another speaker's <b>gestures</b> if the original speaker gazed at the <b>gestures.</b> Moreover, speaker-gaze was a better predictor of this repetition than participants' own gaze. This supports the hypothesis that speakers' gaze at their <b>gestures</b> leads to covert attention shifts in observers, causing the <b>gestures</b> to be processed differently. Speaker-gaze could therefore be a valuable cue to the processing and production of <b>gestures</b> by artificial systems that interact with humans...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our findings from a field study that {{was conducted at}} the Vancouver Aquarium to investigate how visitors interact with a large interactive table exhibit using multi-touch <b>gestures.</b> Our findings show that the choice and use of multi-touch <b>gestures</b> are influenced not only by general preferences for certain <b>gestures</b> {{but also by the}} interaction context and social context they occur in. We found that <b>gestures</b> are not executed in isolation but linked into sequences where previous <b>gestures</b> influence the formation of subsequent <b>gestures.</b> Furthermore, <b>gestures</b> were used beyond the manipulation of media items to support social encounters around the tabletop exhibit. Our findings indicate the importance of versatile many-to-one mappings between <b>gestures</b> and their actions that, other than one-to-one mappings, can support fluid transitions between <b>gestures</b> as part of sequences and facilitate social information exploration.

Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra.

40|$|Chimpanzees display several <b>gestures</b> {{in their}} {{communicative}} repertoire, but few data exist regarding how they use {{and respond to}} <b>gestures</b> in their natural social and environmental settings. To address this deficiency, I conducted a systematic study of gestural communication by chimpanzees living in an unusually large community at Ngogo in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. Two central goals were to describe the kinds of <b>gestures</b> used by chimpanzees and to evaluate the effect that social relationships have on <b>gesturing</b> behavior. The Ngogo chimpanzees used 78 <b>gestures</b> in six behavioral contexts. They displayed considerable flexibility in their use, producing single <b>gestures</b> in several contexts and different <b>gestures</b> in the same context. Individuals in three other communities in the wild produce a strikingly similar number of <b>gestures</b> that mirrors the number recorded at Ngogo, an observation consistent with the hypothesis chimpanzees acquire <b>gestures</b> {{through a process of}} phylogenetic ritualization. Chimpanzees form differentiated social relationships. Males are much more gregarious than females are. Adult males also form strong and enduring social bonds with each other. I investigated whether variation in social relationships affected who <b>gestured</b> and responded to whom. Results showed that adult males used and responded to <b>gestures</b> with each other more often than they did when communicating with other individuals. Additional analysis revealed that adult males used and responded to <b>gestures</b> frequently with adult males with whom they formed strong bonds. These findings support an alternative hypothesis that suggests chimpanzees learn <b>gestures</b> via ontogenetic ritualization. I conducted a final series of analyses to examine whether social factors affected the number of <b>gestures</b> adult male chimpanzees used and their patterns of repetition. Adult males used many <b>gestures</b> when they signaled to other adult males. Adult males also repeated <b>gestures</b> more often when signaling to adult males and adolescent males compared with when they <b>gestured</b> to adult females. In sum, results of this thesis underscore the fact that <b>gesturing</b> is a communicative act involving both signalers and recipients. Understanding how <b>gestures</b> are used requires knowledge of both parties and their social relationships...|$|R
40|$|Although {{research}} has identified {{many types of}} <b>gestures</b> related to time and has studied the overall effectiveness of these <b>gestures,</b> the current study observes whether the chosen direction of those <b>gestures</b> affects the recall of time related information. Specifically, <b>gestures</b> that place the past on the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s left and the future on the right along a Personal Timeline (PT) will be compared to <b>gestures</b> that travel in the opposite direction, along an Audience Timeline (AT). Meanwhile <b>gestures</b> as a whole will also be compared to no <b>gestures.</b> Recall will be measured by percent correct on a seven question online quiz, taken by participants after viewing a six minute video lesson. I hypothesize that the participants viewing <b>gestures</b> made along the AT will demonstrate improved recall over those viewing <b>gestures</b> made along the PT, and also hypothesize that groups viewing <b>gestures</b> as a whole will demonstrate improved recall over the group not viewing <b>gestures</b> in the lesson.

40|$|International audienceIn {{everyday}} life, {{speech is}} accompanied by <b>gestures.</b> In the present study, two experiments tested the possibility that spontaneous <b>gestures</b> accompanying speech carry prosodic information. Experiment 1 showed that <b>gestures</b> provide prosodic information, as adults are able to perceive the congruency between low-pass filtered—thus unintelligible—speech and the <b>gestures</b> of the speaker. Experiment 2 shows {{that in the case}} of ambiguous sentences (i. e., sentences with two alternative meanings depending on their prosody) mismatched prosody and <b>gestures</b> lead participants to choose more often the meaning signaled by <b>gestures.</b> Our results demonstrate that the prosody that characterizes speech is not a modality specific phenomenon: it is also perceived in the spontaneous <b>gestures</b> that accompany speech.
