50|$|Differential {{hardening}} (also called <b>differential</b> <b>quenching,</b> selective quenching, selective hardening, {{or local}} hardening) is {{most commonly used}} in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge. This helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking, by making the spine very soft and bendable, but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered. This helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp, wear-resistant edge, even during rough use such as found in combat.|$|E
50|$|Having {{a single}} edge {{provides}} certain advantages; one {{being that the}} rest of the sword can be used to reinforce and support the edge. The Japanese style of sword-making takes full advantage of this. When forging is complete, the steel is not quenched in the conventional European fashion (i.e.: uniformly throughout the blade). Steel’s exact flex and strength vary dramatically with heat treating. If steel cools quickly it becomes martensite, which is very hard but brittle. Slower and it becomes pearlite, which bends easily and does not hold an edge. To maximize both the cutting edge and the resilience of the sword spine, a technique of differential heat-treatment is used. In this specific process, referred to as differential hardening or <b>differential</b> <b>quenching,</b> the sword is painted with layers of clay before heating, providing a thin layer or none at all on the edge of the sword, ensuring quick cooling to maximize the hardening for the edge. A thicker layer of clay is applied to the rest of the blade, causing slower cooling. This creates softer, more resilient steel, allowing the blade to absorb shock without breaking. This process is sometimes erroneously called differential tempering but this is actually an entirely different form of heat treatment.|$|E

FRET measured as fluorescence quenching of long-chain donor probes such as DiO-C 18 is greater with long-chain, saturated acceptor probes such as DiI-C 16 than with unsaturated or shorter-chain acceptors with the same chromophoric headgroup compared at identical concentrations. FRET measurements between these lipid probes in model membranes support the conclusion that <b>differential</b> donor <b>quenching</b> is not caused by nonideal mixing or spectroscopic differences. Sucrose gradient analysis of plasma membrane-labeled, Triton X- 100 -lysed cells shows that proximity measured by FRET correlates with the extent of lipid probe partitioning into detergent-resistant membranes. FRET between DiO-C 16 and DiI-C 16 is sensitive to cholesterol depletion and disruption of liquid order (Lo) by short-chain ceramides, and it is enhanced by cross linking of Lo-associated proteins. Consistent results are obtained when homo-FRET is measured by decreased fluorescence anisotropy of DiI-C 16. These results support the existence of nanometer-scale Lo/liquid disorder heterogeneity of lipids in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in live cells...|$|R

The phospholipid/water partition coefficient of (+) -totarol was found to be very high (Kp= 1. 8 × 104), suggesting that it incorporates very efficiently into membranes.

This study aims {{to unravel the}} mechanism of action of this drug at the membrane level and address the eventual protective role of peptidoglycan in cell walls. The interaction of omiganan pentahydrochloride with bacterial and mammalian membrane models – large unilamellar vesicles of different POPC:POPG proportions – was characterized by UV-Vis fluorescence spectroscopy. The molar ratio partition constants obtained for the two anionic bacterial membrane models were very high ((18. 9 ± 1. 3) × 103 and (43. 5 ± 8. 7) × 103) and about one order of magnitude greater than for the neutral mammalian models ((3. 7 ± 0. 4) × 103 for 100 % POPC bilayers). At low lipid:peptide ratios there were significant deviations from the usual hyperbolic-like partition behavior of peptide vesicle titration curves, especially for the most anionic systems. Membrane saturation can account for such observations and mathematical models were derived to further characterize the peptide–lipid interaction under those conditions; a possible relation between saturation and MIC was deduced; this was supported by <b>differential</b> <b>quenching</b> studies of peptide internalization.

40|$|The {{vaporization}} of a droplet, {{interacting with}} its neighbors in a non-dilute spray environment is examined {{as well as a}} vaporization scaling law established {{on the basis of a}} recently developed theory of renormalized droplet. The interacting droplet consists of a centrally located droplet and its vapor bubble which is surrounded by a cloud of droplets. The distribution of the droplets and the size of the cloud are characterized by a pair-distribution function. The vaporization of a droplet is retarded by the collective thermal quenching, the vapor concentration accumulated in the outer sphere, and by the limited percolative passages for mass, momentum and energy fluxes. The retardation is scaled by the local collective interaction parameters (group combustion number of renormalized droplet, droplet spacing, renormalization number and local ambient conditions). The numerical results of a selected case study reveal that the vaporization correction factor falls from unity monotonically as the group combustion number increases, and saturation is likely to occur when the group combustion number reaches 35 to 40 with interdroplet spacing of 7. 5 diameters and an environment temperature of 500 K. The scaling law suggests that dense sprays can be classified into: (1) a diffusively dense cloud characterized by uniform thermal quenching in the cloud; (2) a stratified dense cloud characterized by a radial stratification in temperature by the <b>differential</b> thermal <b>quenching</b> of the cloud; or (3) a sharply dense cloud marked by fine structure in the quasi-droplet cloud and the corresponding variation in the correction factor due to the variation in the topological structure of the cloud characterized by a pair-distribution function of quasi-droplets...|$|R

Dimerization is central to procaspase activation because the active sites are comprised of loops from both monomers. Although initiator procaspases are stable monomers until activated on cell death scaffolds, the effector caspases, such as procaspase- 3, are stable dimers. The activation mechanisms are reasonably well {{understood in terms of}} polypeptide chain cleavage and subsequent active site rearrangements in the dimer, but the mechanisms that govern dimer assembly are not known. To further understand procaspase dimerization, we examined the folding and assembly of procaspase- 3 by fluorescence emission, circular dichroism, <b>differential</b> <b>quenching</b> by acrylamide, anisotropy, and enzyme activity assays. Single-mixing stopped-flow refolding studies showed a complex burst phase in which multiple monomeric species form rapidly. At longer times, the monomer folds through several intermediates, some of which appear to be off-pathway or misfolded, before eventually forming a dimerization-competent species. Enzyme activity studies demonstrated a slow rate of dimerization (∼ 70 M− 1 s− 1). In addition, single-mixing stopped-flow unfolding studies revealed a complex unfolding process with a slow rate of dimer dissociation. Interestingly, multiple dimeric species were observed in the burst phase for unfolding, suggesting that the native ensemble consists of at least two major conformations. Collectively, these results demonstrate complex folding and unfolding behavior for procaspase- 3 and suggest that slow dimerization results from the lack of stabilizing native contacts in the initial encounter complex...|$|E

The rotational mobility of tyrosine in membrane-embedded ShB, examined from the decay of fluorescence anisotropy, can be described by two different rotational correlation times and a residual constant value. The short correlation time corresponds to fast rotation reporting on local tyrosine mobility. The long rotational correlation time and the high residual anisotropy suggest that the ShB peptide diffuses in a viscous and anisotropic medium compatible with the aliphatic region of a lipid bilayer and support the hypothesis that the peptide inserts into it as a monomer, to configure an intramolecular â-hairpin structure.

An example study probing the interactions between charged fluorophores and surfactant vesicles is included as a demonstration of a time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy application. Understanding the effect of side chain modifications on the emission of light from conjugated polymers is useful in the design of new polymers for applications in sensing and photovoltaics. This thesis focuses on determining the photophysical interactions between a photochromic side chain, azobenzene, covalently bound to a poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) derivative. Time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence measurements were employed in these studies. The photochromic azobenzene quenches emission from the PPV backbone differentially in its' two isomeric states. Both static quenching and non-radiative energy transfer were found to play important roles in the <b>differential</b> <b>quenching</b> of PPV emission by azobenzene.

Maximizing the modulation efficiency was the aim of the PPV studies.

The grain size formed on material after heat treatment is finer grain size {{and there are no}} flakes. Different with material before heat treatment, it shows that there are flakes and the grain size is thin inside it. The predicted result showed that heat treatment exerted on material is influencing the change of mechanical properties and microstructure...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{physical}} and chemical properties of mould fluxes are important to the successful operation of continuous casting machines. The principal role of mould fluxes is to provide lubrication between the solidifying steel and the mould but mould fluxes also significantly influence heat transfer between the stand and the mould. Heat extraction from the steel being cast has a marked effect {{on the quality of the}} final product and several defects in cast products can be related to mould flux performance. Heat transfer in mould flux is complicated by the fact that the flux partially solidifies when in contact with the mould. Different rates of solidification of mould fluxes and the resultant structures are critical to the heat transfer characteristics of the mould. Mould fluxes are largely made up of oxides which can form crystalline or glassy solids on cooling from a melt, depending on composition and cooling rate. It is known that heat transfer in a crystalline material differs from heat transfer in the glassy or liquid form of the same material due to the differing heat transfer mechanisms operating in each state. In order to understand heat transfer through mould flux, it is essential to understand the contribution of liquid, glassy, and crystalline structures to the overall heat transfer. This in turn requires an understanding of the solidification behaviour of mould fluxes. Until recently, this knowledge has been based mostly on empirical studies, though more recent research has attempted to relate observed crystallization and glass forming phenomena to fundamental principles. Special techniques have been developed to study mould flux solidification, however, the thermal conditions and the mould flux structures' obtained during casting are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Methods such as <b>differential</b> thermal analysis, <b>quench</b> tests, high temperature microscopy, single and double hot thermocouple techniques, confocal microscopy and others have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to quantify crystallization and glass formation in mould fluxes. This paper summarises two studies carried on industrial mould fluxes at the University of Wollongong in cooperation with BHP Steel...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} two projects involving novel {{applications of}} physical organic chemistry. The first project involved investigation {{into a series}} of nitrile-substituted benzyl radicals and their remarkable persistence and attenuated reactivity towards oxygen. Following the characterization of these species by time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, we anticipated that, through radical-radical recombination reactions, they could successfully employed in carbon-carbon bond formation via the application of the Persistent Free Radical Effect (PFRE). In general, radical-radical coupling reactions are inadequate for organic synthetic purposes as they tend to yield complex product mixtures. However, this restriction may be circumvented through use of the PFRE, a kinetic phenomenon that leads to cross-product formation in coupling reactions between persistent and transient radicals. It is possible to exploit this effect as a synthetic tool {{through the use of a}} "radical buffer", in which persistent radicals are generated thermally from dimeric derivatives of the aforementioned persistent carbon-centred radicals. If a transient radical is then introduced photochemically, it will recombine selectively with the persistent radical species. This process is demonstrated in the steady-state photolysis and laser flash photolysis studies of dibenzyl ketone with 2, 2, 3, 3 -tetraphenylsuccinonitrile to produce 2, 3, 3 -triphenylproprionitrile. Therefore, by carefully choosing persistent/transient radical pairs, this method may be applied as a simple and effective alternative for more complex organic syntheses. In subsequent experiments, we found that, along with novel carbon-carbon bond formation, involvement of the persistent carbon-centred radicals could also be applied to other systems, such as the photodecomposition of a pesticide, and the trapping of peroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals. The second project investigated the use of pyrene fluorescence quenching as a technique to detect electron-deficient compounds. The photophysical properties of pyrene in dilute and concentrated solutions have been a topic of intense research interest for many years and the dynamic equilibrium between the monomer and excimer forms has been largely elucidated. However, the effect of certain fluorescence quenchers on the ratio of emission from the two species remained largely unexplored. Time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence techniques were employed to study the quenching behaviour of concentrated pyrene solutions. It was found that certain quenchers, namely electron-poor compounds, were able to efficiently quench both the monomer and excimer species, with bimolecular quenching rate constants approaching diffusion control. As a consequence, by monitoring the monomer-to-excimer fluorescence ratio, it is possible to identify and quantify these compounds. Therefore, this characteristic allows for potential security-related applications, including the detection of explosives and for rapid screening of complex samples suspected of containing explosives. The concept of differential monomer-to-excimer fluorescence quenching was then extrapolated to other systems that we found intriguing. For example, it was found that, in addition to nitroaromatics, molecular oxygen also quenches both species with rate constants approaching diffusion-control; thus, this methodology can also feasibly be applied to sensing dissolved oxygen. As well, we explored the effect of constrained media on <b>differential</b> <b>quenching,</b> including the use of gas-permeable silicone films and supramolecular materials (zeolites), both heavily-loaded with pyrene, with the idea that these materials could potentially be developed as cheap and disposable sensor materials...|$|E
