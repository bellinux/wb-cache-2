Instead, the combination of hair, shoulder and background dominated the whole recognition process.

30|$|In the {{emergency}} department’s everyday clinical practice, {{the emergency}} physicians have the overall responsibility for patient treatment. In 2017, The Danish National Board of Health {{decided to make}} emergency medicine a formally recognized specialty. Hence, even though the emergency physicians have a supra-specialty in emergency medicine, they are consultants specialized in different fields and have different skills and experiences. They solve tasks, collaborate, and process information in the department in different ways. The other employees notice these differences: “It is different what the emergency physicians do and what they can do” (Observation, coordinating nurse, night shift, Sunday, August 2015). On weekdays, 3 – 4 emergency physicians are on duty in the emergency department, each one managing a self-contained subunit. They rotate between the three subunits: flow master, ward rounds, emergency physician at A 1. If needed, they can shift resources between subunits. They are able {{to adapt to the}} situation in an organization where few tasks can be pre-planned. Moreover, they often use and complement one another’s competences. “In the daytime, if I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> cardiology, then I ask Peter. There are always three emergency physicians at the department and sometimes four. Therefore, it is piece of cake just to ask one of the others. However, I am at my best when I am in the emergency room. Here I can solve all tasks pretty much” (Interview, emergency physician, February 2017). The emergency physicians act as a team, and because they use one another’s competences, it is the team's competences that become important. Because of the knowledge exchange between the physicians on an as-needed basis, they increase the amount of information they can process (Burton et al. 2011).|$|E
