He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to <b>democratic</b> <b>governance.</b> Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's <b>democratic</b> <b>governance.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Democratic</b> local <b>governance</b> {{emerged in}} Nigeria in the 1950 s {{as a result}} of the {{granting}} of regional self-government status by the British colonial government. After more than sixty years of local democracy in the country, it is regrettable that while local government is of strategic importance in the national development process, its contribution has not been substantial. This is in spite of enormous resources that have been committed to ensuring that it contributes significantly to the national development process. Advancing the capacity of local governments to act effectively and accountably requires <b>democratic</b> local <b>governance,</b> relative autonomy and the political will of the local actors to engage in activities that significantly benefit the local populace. The argument of this paper is that, while these three factors are prerequisites for sound local government, the issue of <b>democratic</b> local <b>governance</b> is the key factor which when addressed will drive and strengthen the other two factors to put local government on a sound footing. Where <b>democratic</b> local <b>governance</b> advances and flourishes, decentralisation becomes more effective and local governments and the communities concerned gain the authority, resources, and skills to make responsive choices and to act on them effectively and accountably...|$|R

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, an American {{political}} consensus {{began to}} emerge suggesting that democratic transition should be actively supported – a consensus only more firmly established following the dissolution of the Soviet Union when the United States found itself in less of a difficult position balancing security concerns and promotion of its ideals. This was based in part on democratic peace theory, which added a security element to democracy promotion. The Middle East was not excluded from this discussion, with some calling for increased American democracy promotion as a means of encouraging more peaceful relations with Israel and moderating extremists, while not {{going so far as to}} destabilize friendly autocratic regimes. The assumption that a positive relationship exists between <b>democratic</b> <b>governance</b> and peace which was prominent in the 1990s faced some inconsistency in the Middle East, however, because regimes that engaged to some extent in the peace process with Israel (and in the case of Jordan successfully reached a peace agreement) at the same time slowly and half-heartedly pursued democratization and allowed little opening to opposition movements who resisted negotiation with Israel.|$|E
