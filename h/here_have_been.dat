5|$|There {{is no sign}} of Roman occupation, but the Anglo-Saxons took Watchet {{from the}} native Britons around AD 680. Under Alfred the Great (AD 871−901) Watchet became an {{important}} port, and coins minted <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found as far away as Copenhagen and Stockholm. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the early port being plundered by Danes led by Earl Ottir and a 'Hroald' (possibly Ottir's king Ragnall) in 987 and 997.|$|E

25|$|Alloway Mote {{stands at}} the tip of a {{pronounced}} meander of the River Doon on the Doonholm Estate opposite a Victorian lodge house. Its position is on a steep bluff and erosion has resulted in part of the earthwork collapsing into the river so any defensive features <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost.

25|$|Besides the grotto and cave systems, Phong Nha has {{the longest}} {{underground}} river. The Sơn and Chay {{are the main}} rivers in this national park. Most of caves <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shaped by Son and Chay Rivers. The Son River flows {{into the mouth of}} the Phong Nha cave and keeps on underground, where it is called the Nam Aki River. It emerges 20km to the south near Pu-Pha-Dam Mountain. There are spectacular streams, springs and waterfalls in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng, namely: Gió waterfall, Madame Loan waterfall, Mọc stream erupting from a limestone mount range, and Trạ Ang stream.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its heyday}} {{at the turn}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of the large homes built <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> replaced, {{modified}} or abandoned with many lots subdivided. One reason that the colonia declined was the building of Line 2 of the Metro along Ribera de San Cosme Avenue, making this street a main corridor for the city. This bought in crowds of people, which then led to the construction of stores, hotels and nightclubs, which was often unregulated. This, in turn, caused many of the area’s wealthier residents to move out. The Circuito Interior was constructed in 1973. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake did significant damage here, and buildings since then have fallen due to structural damage related to the quake.|$|E

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} assumed that as people age {{they will become}} less internal and more external, but data <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ambiguous. Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel (cited in Johnson et al., 2004) imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter. Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) (for example, Heckhausen and Schulz (1995) or Ryckman and Malikosi, 1975) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.|$|E
25|$|The faunal {{diversity}} of wild life in Tanzania in its {{national parks and}} game reserves is also dramatic. There are 310 mammal species (fourth largest in Africa); 960 species of birds (third place in Africa); and many amphibians and reptiles, which are stated to form the fourth largest population in Africa. The endangered fauna species are; the black rhino; Uluguru bushshrikes; hawksbill, green turtles, olive ridley turtle and leatherback turtles; red colobus monkeys; wild dogs; and Pemba flying foxes. However, Lonely Planet also mentions a figure of 430 species of four million animals, and 60,000 insect species, 100 species of snakes and 25 species of reptiles, 1000 species of birds. More details of fauna species {{as reported by the}} Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, Bucknell University, Avibase data profiles and BirdLife International data profiles are the following. In the East Usambara Mountains, the forests display many rare species, {{so much so that the}} fauna found <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> compared to the Galapagos Islands in terms of biological importance.|$|E

[...] The other side of the building showcases animals and their adaptations for a variety of survival needs.

A small nocturnal area showcases animals who have adapted to life at night.|$|E

2500|$|Emigrants from Madeira also {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the ukulele was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the cavaquinho and the rajao. The ukulele was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that [...] "Madeira Islanders recently arrived <b>here,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> delighting the people with nightly street concerts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huastec {{is derived}} from the Spanish Huasteca which {{is derived from}} the Nahuatl word for the {{ethnicity}} Kuextlan. The Huastecs were the northernmost Mesoamerican group on the Gulf coast, and their contact with the Chichimeca led to Aridoamerican influences in their culture. The pre-Hispanic sculpture of the region is distinct, with well-known pieces such as the [...] "Adolescente de Tamuín" [...] and the goddess of life and health Tlazolteotl. Traditionally crops <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> corn, beans, squash, various chili peppers and tubers such as yucca, camotes and jicamas. However, gathering of wild foods played a more important role here in the Mesoamerican period, especially roots, small chili peppers and a fruit (Brosimum alicastrum) as well as fish from lakes, rivers and ocean. The production of salt was important at Chila Lake.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remains of}} a {{crossing}} tower on the French Church of Saint-Jean de Montierneuf from about 1140 suggest an origin for some Spanish domes in a Romanesque and transitional Gothic style. The architectural influences at work <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> much debated, with proposed origins ranging from Jerusalem, Islamic Spain, or the Limousin region in western France to a mixture of sources. During the Reconquista, the Kingdom of León in northern Spain built three churches famous for their domed crossing towers, called [...] "cimborios", as it acquired new territories. The Cathedral of Zamora, the Cathedral of Salamanca, and the collegiate church of Toro were built around {{the middle of the}} 12th century. All three buildings have stone umbrella domes with sixteen ribs over windowed drums of either one or two stories, springing from pendentives. All three also have four small round towers engaged externally to the drums of the domes on their diagonal sides. Perhaps the masterpiece of the series, the Salamanca crossing tower has two stories of windows in its drum. Its outer stone fish-scale roof lined with gothic crockets is a separate corbelled layer with only eight lobes, which applies weight to the haunches of the sixteen-sided inner dome.|$|E

2500|$|This {{art market}} was {{established}} in the 1950s in order to give young and unknown artists a chance to show and sell their work. [...] This is still the case today. Some move on from the market after they gain some fame, but others stay here either because of need or preference. One of the latter is Jorge Espinosa Carrizales, who has been selling at the market for over forty years. Because of his longevity at the market, he is nicknamed “el muerto” (the dead one) [...] A number of artists give classes in the market itself in painting, sculpture and even violin, which is given by Espinoza Carrizales at the Serapio Rendón corner of the park. Other longtime artists in the market include Roberto Ulises, Marco Antonio Zepeda, Reynaldo Torres and Armando Anguiano. Some dismiss the market as for lesser talents because of its public character and others because it has become a tourist attraction. Longtime artist Roberto Ulises states that exhibiting here can shut an artist out of venues such as the INBA, but declined to say why. However, a number of artists from <b>here</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recruited by national and international galleries and other venues, including the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte [...]|$|E
