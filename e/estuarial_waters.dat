40|$|The Belgian {{coast is}} the result of a {{continuous}} domestication of natural forces that up till not so long ago overpowered human capabilities. Both the intruding sea as meandering river mouths flooded the polders and the dunes were continuously changing position due to whimsical winds and sea sand deposits. In these dynamic forces human presence was always volatile and nomadic. The increasing technical capacity to deal with forces of this scale resulted in the rather engineered urban realm of the Belgian coast. Pumping mechanism dried out polders and allowed more agricultural and livestock production; the sea dyke fixed human resistance towards the sea with the "sea dyke typology" - the multistory holiday apartment block leading to the famous coastal wall - as a result; finally it instigated the gradual disappearance of the vast dune landscape that did become a protected landscape with the ecological awareness, an ironic artifact of its once dynamic appearance; the presence of the harbors and inland canals also technified the rich <b>estuarial</b> salt-to-sweet <b>water</b> gradient to disconnected water systems. The Belgian coast was made fully operational, the king looked back satisfied when escaping by boat towards more romantic - more natural - holiday destinations. Climate change has made us question the flexibility of this operational frame. Is the sea going to flood urbanized areas? What will happen with saline intrusion when sea levels go up? Are the dunes of today the beaches of tomorrow? Are the higher frequencies of storms going to re-flood the polders? Those questions are often posed in their wrongfully disguised and technically contextualized version: are the dykes high enough? Can the pumps clear the water in the polders? Can we heighten the beaches with dredged sand? How deep do we dig our new wells to find sweet water without saline intrusion? Our thinking should change perspective. Instead of continuously thinking of technical solutions, we should reinvent the way we inhabit the dynamic landscape and start primarily by rebuilding these dynamics. A resilient landscape would automatically lead to a more adapted urban realm in which many technical questions are no longer the most relevant. nrpages: 16 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Nitrates Directive {{was adopted}} {{as a result}} of concern over water {{pollution}} caused by nitrate (NO 3) derived from agriculture. It is a EU environmental policy where inadequate implementation exists within some Member States. Brittany, Denmark and England are compared in order to evaluate such implementation variation, and determine if policy instruments can achieve their goals. Structured field interviews with numerous actors in the policy implementation process identified that it is most appropriate to designate a whole country as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, as in Denmark, rather than distinct areas. Action Programmes differ in their ability to potentially reduce NO 3 losses, and the more stringent Danish measures appear to have caused a decline in NO 3 leaching from the root zone. The use of water quality indicators to assess Action Programme effectiveness is limited, as cause and effect is difficult to determine with a downstream method. Denmark's national aquatic monitoring network seems to be representative and is relatively standardised, in comparison to England. At present, only Danish streams have demonstrated a convincing downward trend, since 1992, in NO 3 concentrations. Responses in ground, coastal and <b>estuarial</b> <b>waters</b> are not expected for some years. It is unclear whether Action Programme measures and water quality standards stated in the Nitrates Directive are capable of improving the quality of our aquatic environment. The Nitrates Directive is poorly drafted legislation that could fail to deliver its aim, especially as some Member States have not achieved full implementation. This paper proposes that the Water Framework Directive's holistic, catchment-based approach may have more potential to effectively control diffuse water pollution from agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The only {{species of}} {{crayfish}} {{native to the}} British Isles, i. e. Austropotamobius pallipes, is presently widely distributed throughout much of England, Wales and Ireland. The main controlling factor behind this distribution is the predominantly "bicarbonate" freshwater system of the British Isles. In geological terms, native crayfish are generally found in areas of chalk, carboniferous or magnesium limestone, or drift deposits of boulder clay. More recently, native crayfish {{have been affected by}} a general decline in the quality of Britain's freshwater system largely due to sewage effluent and agricultural. By far the majority of native crayfish records are associated with water bodies of very good or good quality, with the result that many populations of A. pallipes are isolated in small, good quality headwaters, due to the degree of pollution in the main rivers acting as "chemical barriers". The last two decades have seen a number of alien species of crayfish imported into England and Wales for aquaculture and culinary purposes. Deliberate and accidental introductions have resulted in the establishment of populations of these species in the wild, the most widespread being the North American signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and the European slender-clawed crayfish Astacus leptodactylus. An important and devastating consequence of the introduction of alien species of crayfish has been the spread of the crayfish plague fungus Aphanomyces astaci, possibly initiated by infected P. leniusculus. Both A. pallipes and A. leptodactylus are susceptible to the disease, with the result that populations of A. pallipes have been eliminated from, whole lengths of river, such as the River Kennet and the Hampshire River Avon. The nature of the disease and the ease with which it is spread means that crayfish is an ongoing problem in England and Wales, with new populations of A. pallipes regularly becoming affected. The distribution of alien species in the British Isles is an artificial one, initially determined by man, although consideration of water quality may have determined the choice of aquaculture sites. However, established populations of alien species in the wild will be subject to the same constraints as A. pallipes, which will affect their subsequent spread and distribution in the freshwater system of England and Wales. A greater tolerance of environmental factors may allow alien species to inhabit waters not currently occupied by the native species, such as polluted or <b>estuarial</b> <b>waters,</b> and possibly threaten populations of A. pallipes protected by "chemical barriers". This study investigated and compared some of the environmental tolerances of A. pallipes, A. leptodactylus and P. leniusculus and consisted of two parts: 1.) Comparison of the tolerance of A. pallipes, A. leptodactylus and P. leniusculus to four common pollutants; chloride, copper, ammonia and lindane, using lethal and sublethal toxicity tests. No species was found to have a greater overall pollution tolerance {{on the basis of the}} toxicants used in this study. Median lethal concentrations (LC 50) obtained from lethal studies with stage II juveniles indicated that A. leptodactylus juveniles were most tolerant of chloride, but were very sensitive to lindane. P. leniusculus stage II juveniles were least tolerant of chloride, but of equal or greater tolerance when tested in larger juvenile stages, and were most tolerant of copper. A. pallipes juveniles were very sensitive to copper, and all three species showed a similar sensitivity to ammonia. However, episodic experiments with ammonia and copper indicated that differential short-term tolerance to toxicants, i. e. less than 24 hours, may be important in determining the outcome of episodic pollution events on crayfish populations. Salinity studies indicated high resistance to chloride, with all three species able to tolerate salinities up to 50 % seawater, implying freshwater crayfish may be able to tolerate estuarine conditions. Accumulation studies with P. leniusculus inferred resistance to high levels of copper in the environment, with a substantial storage capacity for the metal and a regulatory mechanism for excretion of excess amounts. However, establishment of populations under high saline or high copper conditions would be limited by the lower tolerance of early life stages. Similarly, sublethal studies implied that sublethal toxicant effects on early life stages may be important in determining presence or absence of crayfish from a waterbody, through effects on recruitment. 2.) Comparison of the thermal relations of A. pallipes, A. leptodactylus and P. leniusculus, using tolerance, growth and respiration experiments. Results from tolerance experiments showed that P. leniusculus had a greater overall thermal tolerance, so is more resistant to changes in environmental temperature, such as in waters affected by thermal discharges or in waters affected by drought and reduced flow. In growth experiments P. leniusculus grew faster at all temperatures tested and was predicted to grow at temperatures unsuitable for the other species. Therefore, P. leniusculus would not only be able to survive and grow in conditions unsuitable for A. pallipes and A. leptodactylus, but will also grow faster where favourable conditions exist for all three species. Field experiments showed that, although P. leniusculus juveniles were smaller on release from the female, they were released earlier and their faster growth rate allowed them to maintain a distinct size advantage over A. pallipes juveniles, which was very marked by the end of the growing season. Large size is a key element in the attributes leading to competitive success in other crayfish species. Field observations on mixed populations of plague-free P. leniusculus and A. pallipes indeed show that signal crayfish are superior competitors, eventually eliminating A. pallipes. Therefore temperature effects may be important in determining the outcome of competition in mixed crayfish populations...|$|E
