Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul).

5|$|With {{the modern}} <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>golf</b> {{originating}} in 15th century Scotland, {{the country is}} promoted {{as the home of}} golf. To many golfers the Old Course in the Fife town of St. Andrews, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. There are many other famous golf courses in Scotland, including Carnoustie, Gleneagles, Muirfield, and Royal Troon. Other distinctive features of the national sporting culture include the Highland games, curling and shinty. In boxing, Scotland has had 13 world champions, including Ken Buchanan, Benny Lynch and Jim Watt.|$|E
