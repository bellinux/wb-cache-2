5|$|There {{was hardly}} a design element on the ceiling that was not {{subsequently}} imitated: the <b>fictive</b> architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the luminous colouration, the haunting expressions of the figures in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the <b>fictive</b> architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or <b>fictive</b> architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the Highland clan system, evident in records from the thirteenth century. Surnames were rare in the Highlands until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the Middle Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head. At the beginning of the era, the head of a clan was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, it was usually the eldest son of the last chief. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent in status to Lowland gentlemen, providing council to the chief in peace and leadership in war. Below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the Isles and along the adjacent western seaboard, there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids and taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often <b>fictive,</b> kin group.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and the feudal system, which formalised mutual obligations {{of service and}} protection, organised through heritable jurisdictions, {{has been seen as}} creating the Highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and could be called upon to act as soldiers when needed. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often <b>fictive,</b> kin group. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Highland dress was banned, clansmen were forcible disarmed, there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers. Within a generation, these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders, without independent military power.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} shows a <b>fictive</b> Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some {{buildings and}} landmarks {{can be identified}} with Jerusalem. It closely resembles {{the background of the}} Rolin panel, which has undergone much deeper attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the Mosque of Omar, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and which requires a considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of white flowers in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the Ghent Altarpieces central panel; behind Francis are dwarf palms.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a <b>fictive</b> bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E

Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with Highland dress banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs and sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as indentured labour. All of this largely reducing clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within a generation.|$|E

25|$|Both indictments {{were related}} to {{achievement}} of personal tax evasion, through illicit trade of movie rights between Mediaset and secret <b>fictive</b> foreign companies situated in tax haven nations, causing <b>fictive</b> losses for Mediaset, with the trade gains being accumulated by the foreign companies owned by the indicted tax fraudsters, who ultimately had the gains paid out as personal profit without paying tax in Italy. In 2007, the court case at first-instance {{had not yet been}} launched, and the prosecutors dropped the (A) charges against Berlusconi due to the statute of limitations, and for the same reason the (B) charges were narrowed down to the 1994–98 period, in which the prosecutor charged Berlusconi for having committed a personal tax evasion of €7.3 million.|$|E

25|$|George Mantello (11 December 1901– 25 April 1992) was a Jewish diplomat who, {{while working}} for the Salvadoran {{consulate}} in Geneva, Switzerland from 1942 to 1945, saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust by providing them with <b>fictive</b> Salvadoran citizenship papers. He was also instrumental in publicizing in mid-1944 the deportation of Hungarian Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E

25|$|Opposition parties {{pointed out}} that the lists of {{eligible}} voters included 300,000 more people compared to the previous elections, although the population of Moldova has been shrinking. Due to this, they claimed that around 400,000 <b>fictive</b> voters have been created {{in the last two months}} and, therefore, changed the voting result. It was also claimed that the authorities have also printed more than one voting bulletin for certain persons.|$|E
25|$|Artisans {{produced}} religious items, such as long-nosed god maskettes, ceremonial earrings with {{a symbolic}} shape, {{thought to have}} been used in <b>fictive</b> kinship rituals. Many of the stylistically related Mississippian copper plates, such as the Wulfing cache from southeastern Missouri, some of the Etowah plates from Georgia, and many of the Spiro plates from Oklahoma, are associated with the Greater Braden Style and are {{thought to have been}} made in Cahokia in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{classical}} Euclidean notion of 'fixed' absolute space explicitly informed the <b>fictive</b> 'moment' of absolute time, the Cubists jettisoned {{the idea of}} placing the observer at a privileged spatial position at a fixed moment in time. Now, according to the theoretical deliberations of Gleizes and Metzinger, artists were free to move around the subject matter, depicting multiple views 'simultaneously', whereby several successive moments in time could be captured and projected onto the canvas at once. In the process, the 'total image' produced {{over a period of}} time was more complete than a single instantaneous view.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, 2005, {{the novel}} Windows on the World, by Frédéric Beigbeder, was released. The novel focuses on two brothers, aged 7 and 9 years, {{who are in}} the {{restaurant}} with their dad Carthew Yorsten. The novel starts at 8:29 AM (just before the plane hits the tower) and tells about every event on every following minute, ending at 10:30 AM, just after the collapse. Published in 2012, Kenneth Womack's novel The Restaurant at the End of the World offers a <b>fictive</b> recreation of the lives of the staff and visitors at the Windows on the World complex on the morning of September 11.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{agrees with}} all the other Scandinavian sources in telling the story of Halga's incestuous {{relationship}} with his daughter Yrsa, it disagrees with all of them and with Beowulf by removing Hrothgar altogether as the king of Denmark. Instead, his place is taken by his brother Halga, and Hrothgar is sent to Northumberland, where he marries Ögn, the daughter of a positively <b>fictive</b> king Norðri who is named after Northumberland (Norðimbraland). Opinion is divided on whether there is any connection between Hrothgar's wife Wealhþeow in Beowulf and his wife Ögn in Hrólfr Kraki's saga; {{it has been suggested that}} Ögn shows that Wealhþeow and her family (the Helmings) were Anglo-Saxon. Another difference is that Hrothgar's sons Hreðric and Hroðmund do not appear in the Scandinavian tradition, but correspond to Agnar, in Hrólfr Kraki's saga.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{appearance}} of the President is infrequent in the novel, readers' perceptions of him are formed through other, often minor, characters and episodes. As such, literary critic Himelblau states that [...] "the novel does not develop the figure of the President as a <b>fictive</b> personage, does not follow the President through a series of actions or diegetic complications that lead to psychological-existential changes or transformations of his character".|$|E
500|$|Elements of {{the game}} have {{appeared}} elsewhere in popular culture. The original version was selected as one of five for the exhibition The Art of Video Games in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2011. A <b>fictive</b> drink recipe in the game for grog was mistakenly reported as real in 2009 by Argentinian news channel C5N, which urged adolescents against consuming the dangerous [...] "Grog XD" [...] drink. In Tales of Monkey Island, Guybrush refers to this news story while pushing the Grog XD button on a Grog machine.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to The Portage was mixed. Anthony Burgess in The Observer {{called it}} [...] "astonishing", Christopher Booker of The Daily Telegraph {{described}} it as a [...] "powerful piece", and English author A. S. Byatt said it was a [...] "masterpiece". In Explaining Hitler (1998), Rosenbaum called The Portage [...] "A Frankenstein story", referring to Steiner's <b>fictive</b> Hitler having taken {{on a life of its}} own. Writing in Time magazine, Otto Friedrich described the book as [...] "a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity", adding that by not refuting Hitler's speech, Steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book [...] "on a note of bleak ambiguity".|$|E
500|$|Wanting to do {{more than}} just {{represent}} life and death as an opposition, and instead to show the way in which each is inevitably and profoundly involved with the other, Kiarostami has devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable [...] "facts," [...] but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because [...] "existence" [...] means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly <b>fictive</b> element, but in this [...] "being more than" [...] life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving an interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.|$|E
500|$|The 'secondary' lives {{allowed the}} author to {{exercise}} {{freedom in the}} invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts. As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the [...] "biographies" [...] of the [...] "Thirty Tyrants", whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under Gallienus. Moreover, after the biography of Caracalla the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and <b>fictive</b> qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the Life of Caracalla.|$|E
500|$|Steiner {{responded to}} {{criticism}} that Hitler's {{speech in the}} book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before: for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov (1880). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler (A.H.) is [...] "a <b>fictive</b> figure", and that it is not he who has the last word, but Teku, the Indian tracker, who shouts [...] "Proven". Dominick LaCapra said that Teku's declaration is ambiguous, meaning either Hitler has proved his innocence or his guilt. Steiner explained this ambiguity by adding that Teku is the Hebrew word used to indicate that [...] "there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Windsor Castle {{occupies}} , and {{combines the}} features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992. It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having [...] "a certain <b>fictive</b> quality", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating [...] "a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. Although {{there has been some}} criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a [...] "place amongst the greatest European palaces".|$|E
500|$|A {{great number}} of small figures are {{integrated}} with the painted architecture, their purpose apparently purely decorative. These include two faux marble putti below the cornice on each rib, each one a male and female pair; stone rams-heads are placed {{at the apex of}} each spandrel; copper-skinned nude figures in varying poses, hiding in the shadows, propped between the spandrels and the ribs like animated bookends; and more putti, both clothed and unclothed strike a variety of poses as they support the nameplates of the Prophets and Sibyls. Above the cornice and to either side of the smaller scenes are an array of round shields, or medaillons. They are framed by a total of twenty more figures, the so-called Ignudi, which {{are not part of the}} architecture but sit on inlaid plinths, their feet planted convincingly on the <b>fictive</b> cornice. Pictorially, the Ignudi appear to occupy a space between the narrative spaces and the space of the chapel itself. (see below) ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in the American {{literary}} magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a [...] "breakthrough work" [...] that [...] "astonishes". He {{was struck by}} the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the [...] "landscape of speech"—the former being [...] "brilliantly registered" [...] with its [...] "immense feeling of physicality", and the latter, [...] "even more dramatic" [...] in the way it exposes [...] "the dark underside of words" [...] and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness. Rosenfeld noted that while Holocaust literature often either soars to [...] "expostulation and apostrophe", or sinks to [...] "a dwindling sob of elegiac lament", Steiner's Lieber [...] "mediates between these two extremes,... simultaneously records and mourns, coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect". What did concern the reviewer, however, was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works, that he had put them [...] "virtually verbatim" [...] into Hitler's mouth, creating the impression that [...] "Steiner's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter's self-understanding". Rosenfeld also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler's speech. He said that Steiner's <b>fictive</b> Hitler plays [...] "the devil's game of language subversion", making [...] "madness [...] like music", something the real Hitler had perfected. By stopping at this point, Rosenfeld felt that Steiner [...] "succumb, rhetorically, to the seductive eloquence of negation", which undermines his own [...] "high standards of moral intelligence". But overall Rosenfeld said The Portage [...] "must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler", forcing us to confront him [...] "in a way hardly seen before in fiction".|$|E
