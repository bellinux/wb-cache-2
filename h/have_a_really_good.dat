She says, [...] "I don't actually remember {{a lot of the}} episodes because they all blend in together for me, and I don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> memory anyway, but I do remember this one and thinking that it was terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|Fueled {{in large}} part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season, Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll. A few {{commentators}} picked the Bulldogs as a possible [...] "sleeper team" [...] to make the Final Four. Stevens was not so sure, privately telling his father, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> team, and I’m not sure how far we can go this year, but next year, we ought to go really far." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> car, {{we just had to}} learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water. The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> understanding. We talk a lot in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, I really like the way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E

6000|$|... "However {{it was my}} {{poverty and}} not my will that consented to be beaten. It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one; and my impulses--affections--vices perhaps they should be called--were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages; who should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> chance {{of being one of}} his country's worthies. You may ridicule me--I am quite willing that you should--I am a fit subject, no doubt. But I think if you knew what I have gone through these last few years you would rather pity me. And if they knew"--he nodded towards the college at which the dons were {{severally}} arriving--"it is just possible they would do the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clearly {{it is not}} {{along these}} lines that the capable men-makers we suppose to be attacking the problem will {{spend much of their}} energies. All the {{experiences}} of Charities and Poor-Law Authorities simply confirm our postulate of the necessity of a standard of comfort if a child is to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> initial chance in the world. The only conceivable solution of this problem is one that will ensure that no child, or only a few accidental and exceptional children, will be born outside these advantages. It is no good trying to sentimentalize the issue away. This is the end we must attain, to attain any effectual permanent improvement in the conditions of childhood. A certain number of people have to be discouraged and prevented from parentage, and a great number of homes have to be improved. How can we ensure these ends, or how far can we go towards ensuring them? ...|$|E
