Two of Michael's lines, [...] "The hand strikes {{and gives a}} flower" [...] and [...] "Blessed be those who sit and wait" [...] were described by Wilson as Confucian and biblical, respectively. Carell joked that Michael Scott himself should self-publish a book of inspirational sayings. Jenna Fischer revealed that her line, [...] "Please don't throw garbage at me" [...] was her favorite line of the first season. Michael's line, [...] "Try {{not to be too}} gay on the court" [...] was improvised by Carell and Krasinski's reaction was real, as he had no idea Carell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

[...] "I went around the outside to pass him and braked really late, and I think he spun. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was {{completely}} Ralf's fault. I mean, we were racing and everything...I know I gave him plenty of room because I was right {{on the edge of the}} track. Because I braked so late, I nearly didn't even make the corner. I braked really late, just made the corner, and something hit me in the back. When I looked in the mirror, I saw Ralf." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laurie's parents, {{who were}} of Scottish descent, {{attended}} St. Columba's Presbyterian Church of England (now United Reformed Church) in Oxford. He notes that [...] "belief in God didn't play {{a large role}} in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did". He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. It was something to this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it." [...] He later stated, [...] "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted he'd take it away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Verve's members {{sometimes}} expressed bitter sentiments {{about the}} band's later years. In his only interview after the split, McCabe said of Urban Hymns: [...] "By the time I got my parts in there it's {{not really a}} music fan's record. It just sits nicely next to the Oasis record", though conceding, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was bad. I mean, we were good as far as pop goes". During his solo career, Ashcroft expressed regret at having asked McCabe to return for the album instead of releasing it under his own name, saying: [...] "Imagine being the guy that's written an album on his own, bottles it near the end, feels like there's unfinished business, rings Nick McCabe up who adds some guitars, puts it out as the Verve and the same problems arise again. Imagine being that mug. I've now got to rewrite history. Everyone thinks those songs are somehow associated with another bunch of people that I'm not with now". Jones claimed that [...] "The Verve were going off in a direction of strings and ballads, and that's not where I was coming from at all. Loud guitars is it for me", though noting {{that this was not}} why the band split up.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor's {{relationship}} with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In [...] "New Earth", Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This {{is one of}} the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In [...] "School Reunion", the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor falls in love with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss and a strong romantic connection. She even takes him away to [...] "dance", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode [...] "The Doctor Dances") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, although it is described as [...] "a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive." [...] In [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In [...] "The Satan Pit" [...] the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone [...] "If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows". In [...] "Doomsday", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that [...] "he absolutely was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it...</b> he was going to tell her he loved her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don’t {{you talk}} nonsense," [...] said Mr. Blows, violently. [...] "You {{go to them}} interfering Camels and say you want your money—all of <b>it.</b> <b>Say</b> you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Australia. <b>Say</b> <b>it</b> was my last dying wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> a curious fact, sir, {{that he should}} have come and lived here, and been one of my writers, and then that you should come and live here, and be one of my writers too. Which there is nothing derogatory, but far from it in the appellation," [...] says Mr. Snagsby, {{breaking}} off with a mistrust that he may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle, [...] "because I have known writers that have gone into brewers' houses and done really very respectable indeed. Eminently respectable, sir," [...] adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, I {{never did}} know anybody like you, Madame Mantalini,' rejoined Miss Knag most complacently, 'and that's the fact, for {{you know what}} one's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> before <b>it</b> has time to rise to one's lips. Oh, very good! Ha, ha, ha!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘That’s what I {{complain}} of. My {{dead and}} gone father and Pussy’s {{dead and gone}} father must needs marry us together by anticipation. Why the—Devil, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> if <b>it</b> had been respectful to their memory—couldn’t they leave us alone?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>it</b> is nearly finished, and that I should {{not like to}} be vanquished by an affair of this kind," [...] said Geoffrey with emphasis. [...] "Would it hurt the machine if I stood it upon its head, Miss Savine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Helga, who {{was still}} the prettiest of the three, looked up. She also had her {{favourite}} name, but, {{just as she was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> she seemed to hear a voice whisper: 'Marry no one who is not called Habogi.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> now?" [...] she remarked quickly, {{colouring}} as she met his gaze. [...] "Do stop a minute, Clym, and let {{me speak}} first, for oddly enough, I have been wanting {{to say something to}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Andersons!" [...] cried Ethel, laughing. [...] "Margaret {{was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> We only want Harry, to exact the forfeit!

500|$|In September 2013, it was {{reported}} that many senior members of the organizing committee, including then-CEO Ian Troop, expensed Ontario taxpayers for things such as a cup of tea. This led to outrage among provincial politicians including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, [...] "I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> ridiculous. It is the kind of entitlement that is unacceptable". In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013. In December 2013, the CEO Ian Troop was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light. He was replaced by Saad Rafi. In 2014, more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American wine.|$|R

6000|$|... 'True {{kindness}} {{means something}} horridly cross! Now don't, Wilmet. I get ever so much kindness as it is! I {{know what you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> is very naughty of people to like each other when neither of them has got a sixpence; but if they can't help it, what then? Must they leave off liking, eh?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{times for}} ever fled I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> would have sounded strange indeed for Arthur Clennam--Doyce and Clennam {{naturally}} quite different--to make apologies for coming here at any time, {{but that is}} past and what is past can never be recalled except in his own case as poor Mr F. said {{when he was in}} spirits Cucumber and therefore never ate it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fie, fie, fie, Master Julian Peveril," [...] {{said the}} governante; [...] "I {{would have you}} to know that I have always so behaved myself, that the best of the land would have thought twice of it, and have very well {{considered}} both {{what he was going to}} say, and how he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> before he came out with such proposals to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Caustic Love {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, holding {{a score of}} 79/100 on Metacritic, indicating, [...] "generally favourable reviews". In a very positive review, The Independent called the album an [...] "unqualified success", later <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> may be [...] "the best UK R&B album since the 1970s blue-eyed-soul heyday of Rod Stewart and Joe Cocker." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} ask you," [...] he proceeded, [...] "not to be {{offended}} {{with me for}} what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> was a chance remark I heard--no more. It certainly, however, did suggest some association. There {{is a man who}} comes often to Paris, who calls himself a maker of toys. He says that he comes from Leipzig and that his name is Herr Freudenberg." ...|$|E
6000|$|But, alas! {{with the}} book the sounds glided away; and [...] "penna" [...] and [...] "pennam" [...] and [...] "pennis" [...] and [...] "pennæ" [...] were confusedly and indiscriminately mingled.

"Yes, yes, my dear, I {{know what}} you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> was very neatly done; it isn't {{everybody}} who can count out six hundred running hungry sheep without a mistake. But then, I oughtn't to say too much, for you see I have been at it for fifty years, in the old colony and here. Now, many a man would get fifty sheep wrong. There's Niel for instance----" ...|$|E

5000|$|In June 2010, it was {{announced}} that Pereira would be joining Fox Sports to serve as a rules analyst for the network's college and NFL coverage. He began a column on FoxSports.com and started to provide commentary during Fox Sports football telecasts. During Week 1 of the 2010 NFL season, Pereira correctly predicted that referee Gene Steratore would rule {{what appeared to be a}} game-winning catch by Calvin Johnson as incomplete. [...] "That was my first real time of being put on the spot", Pereira would later say. [...] "I was worried to death that the referee was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> a touchdown and I'd be out of a job in one week... It validated my role as to being able to go on and explain things so people could understand why a decision was made on the field. Then at that point on, I got more air time." [...] Pereira is also a frequent guest on KNBR during football season.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It's</b> quite unnecessary.

Yes, quite right. And like you! But it seems to me, my dear Pecksniff,' added Anthony, laying his hand upon his sleeve, 'that if you and I kept up the joke of pretending not to see this, one of us might possibly be placed in a position of disadvantage; and as I am very unwilling to be that party myself, you will excuse my taking the liberty of putting the matter beyond a doubt thus early; and having it distinctly understood, as it is now, that we do see it, and do know it. Thank you for your attention. We are now upon an equal footing; which is agreeable to us both, I am sure.' ...|$|R
