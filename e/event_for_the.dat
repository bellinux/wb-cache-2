However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
