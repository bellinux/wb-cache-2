5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure, causing <b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, {{is one of}} {{the leading}} known causes of mental {{retardation}} in the Western world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{syndrome}} – {{about one}} in four patients with <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome has either an ASD or a ventricular septal defect.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol during {{pregnancy}} can cause <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome and <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorder. Studies {{have shown that}} light to moderate drinking {{during pregnancy}} might not pose a risk to the fetus, although no amount of alcohol during pregnancy can be guaranteed to be absolutely safe.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{spectrum}} disorders (FASDs) are a {{group of}} conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected {{are more likely to}} have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome (FAS). Other types include partial <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{metabolic}} inhibition as {{a result}} of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the elucidated mechanism for <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome and is characterized by teratogenicity closely matching maternal vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{syndrome}} or FAS is a {{birth defect}} {{that occurs in}} the offspring of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. Drinking heavily or {{during the early stages}} of prenatal development has been conclusively linked to FAS; moderate consumption is associated with fetal damage. Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. <b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> exposure is the leading known cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{spectrum}} disorders (FASD) are a {{group of}} conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. FASDs are 100% preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol and Native Americans: 12% of {{the deaths}} among American Indians and Alaska Natives are alcohol-related. In some {{continental}} Amerindian tribes, the rate of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorder {{is as high as}} 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska natives, the rate of <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1000 live births. Deaths due to alcohol among American Indians are more common in men and among Northern Plains Indians, but Alaska Natives showed the least incidence of death. Existing data do indicate, however, that Alaska Native alcohol-related death rates are almost nine times the national average, and approximately 7% of all Alaska Native deaths are alcohol related.|$|E
25|$|Parental {{alcoholism}} {{may affect}} the fetus even before a child is born. In pregnant women, alcohol is carried {{to all of the}} mother’s organs and tissues, including the placenta, where it easily crosses through the membrane separating the maternal and fetal blood systems. When a pregnant woman drinks an alcoholic beverage, the concentration of alcohol in her unborn baby’s bloodstream is the same level as her own. A pregnant woman who consumes alcohol during her pregnancy may give birth to a baby with <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Syndrome (FAS). FAS (<b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome) is known to produce children with damage to the central nervous system, general growth and facial features. The prevalence of this class of disorder is thought to be between 2-5 per 1000.|$|E
25|$|FASDs {{encompass}} a {{range of}} physical and neurodevelopmental problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. The most severe condition is called <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome (FAS), which refers to individuals who have {{a specific set of}} birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{syndrome}} usually {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day. Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during {{the early part of}} pregnancy. Among those who are alcoholic about a third of children have FAS.|$|E
25|$|Prior to <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{syndrome}} being specifically {{identified and}} named in 1973, {{a few studies}} had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy or breast-feeding {{and those who did}} not, but identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{spectrum}} {{disorders are}} preventable by avoiding alcohol. For this reason, medical authorities recommend no alcohol during pregnancy or {{while trying to}} become pregnant. While the condition is permanent, treatment can improve outcomes. Interventions may include parent-child interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and possibly medications.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{to be considered in}} the differential diagnosis include selective mutism, stereotypic movement disorder and bipolar disorder as well as traumatic brain injury or birth trauma, conduct disorder, Cornelia De Lange syndrome, <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, fragile X syndrome, dyslexia, Fahr syndrome, hyperlexia, leukodystrophy, multiple sclerosis and Triple X syndrome.|$|E
25|$|First Nations peoples face {{a number}} of {{problems}} to a greater degree than Canadians overall, many of their living conditions are comparable to developing nations like Haiti. Aboriginals have higher rates of unemployment, rates of incarceration, substance abuse, health problems, homelessness, <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, lower levels of education and higher levels of poverty.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of six-year-olds with alcohol exposure during the second-trimester of pregnancy showed lower {{academic performance and}} problems with reading, spelling, and mathematical skills. 6% of offspring from alcoholic mothers have <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Syndrome (FAS). The risk an offspring born to an alcoholic mothers having FAS increases from 6% to 70% if the mother's previous child had FAS.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge {{drinking is}} more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Heavy regular binge drinking {{is associated with a}}dverse effects on neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders. A US-based review of the literature found that up to one-third of adolescents binge-drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related substance use disorder. Approximately one in 25 women binge-drinks during pregnancy, which can lead to <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome and <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorders. Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism. A large number of adolescents who binge-drink also consume other psychotropic substances.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} safe level of alcohol {{consumption}} either {{when trying to}} get pregnant or during pregnancy. With alcohol abuse remaining highly stigmatized—particularly {{in the case of}} pregnant women—it is believed preferable for treatment programs to focus on a non-judgmental stance, personal empowerment, and to offer resources such as contraceptives to women at risk of pregnancy, in order to prevent <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorder.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses {{unpublished}} Minnesota state {{criteria of}} performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing {{in three or}} more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, no set of {{characteristics}} {{has been discovered}} that results uniquely from cocaine exposure in utero. Cocaine exposure in utero may affect the structure and function of the brain, predisposing children to developmental problems later, or these effects {{may be explained by}} children of crack-using mothers being at higher risk for domestic violence, deadbeat parenting, and maternal depression. When researchers are able to identify effects of PCE, these effects are typically small.|$|E
25|$|FASD is {{estimated}} to affect between 2% and 5% {{of people in the}} United States and Western Europe. FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. In South Africa, some populations have rates as high as 9%. The negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy have been described since ancient times. The lifetime cost per child with FAS was $2,000,000 in 2002. The term <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome was first used in 1973.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Oscar was {{appointed}} Chief Investigator of the Lililwan Prevalence Study on <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Spectrum Disorder and Early Life Trauma. In 2010, she became Chairperson of the Kimberley Language Resource Centre, {{and was considered}} a strong advocate for the recognition, rights, preservation and promotion of Australian Aboriginal languages. In the same year, Oscar also {{became a member of}} the Western Australian Pastoral Lands Board. In 2013, Oscar was elected Councillor to the Derby / West Kimberley Shire, and in 2015, appointed Board Member of the Kimberley Development Commission.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol-related {{birth defects}} (ARBD), {{formerly}} known as possible <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> effect (PFAE), was a term proposed {{as an alternative to}} FAE and PFAE The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD. PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD. The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.|$|E
25|$|June Oscar AO (born 1962) is an Australian Aboriginal {{woman of}} Bunuba descent, {{indigenous}} rights activist, community {{health and welfare}} worker, and film & theatre producer. Oscar {{is best known for}} her fight against <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and work in improving the lives of Aboriginal people in remote communities. In 2007, she led the successful campaign for alcohol restrictions in the Kimberley (Western Australia) town of Fitzroy Valley. On 10 June 2013, Governor-General of Australia Quentin Bryce awarded Oscar an Officer of the Order of Australia, for ‘distinguished service to the Indigenous community of Western Australia, particularly through health and social welfare programs’.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Spectrum Disorder (FASD) {{is known}} to impair memory, {{and the ability to}} learn and retain information. FASD is also {{considered}} a serious threat to preserving Aboriginal cultural traditions in the Valley, which are passed down by elders and not recorded in writing. Aboriginal cultural knowledge is taught to new generations through song, dance and storytelling, and Oscar was concerned. “These kids may have speech delays and difficulty remembering. But memory is critical to our whole heritage because Aboriginal culture and language is passed down orally. Language is the essence of who we are; it identifies us and the world we come from”.|$|E
25|$|Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, {{seeing the}} {{evidence}} as inconclusive {{with respect to}} other types. Partial <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that don’t meet the full criteria for FAS. The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed {{to be related to}} prenatal alcohol exposure, such as spontaneous abortion and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders. It is unclear as of 2017 if identifying a FASD-related conditions benefits the individual.|$|E
25|$|Around a {{year after}} alcohol {{restrictions}} in the Valley came into place, in October 2008, a community meeting led by the MWRC and Nindilingarri Cultural Health Services gathered to talk about FASD and other problems related to alcohol. People who attended the meeting {{were concerned about the}} high number of children and families suffering from the symptoms of FASD and Early Life Trauma (ELT). ELT is a term that defines issues that have a negative influence on a child’s development, such as poor nutrition, neglect, stress and violence. In November 2008, Oscar jointly developed a draft strategy to fight these issues titled Overcoming <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Early Life Trauma (ELT) in the Fitzroy Valley: a community initiative.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of alcohol (also known formally as ethanol) consumption range from cardioprotective health benefits for low to moderate alcohol consumption in industrialized societies with higher rates of cardiovascular disease to severe detrimental effects in cases of chronic alcohol abuse. Health effects associated with alcohol intake in large amounts include {{an increased risk of}} alcoholism, malnutrition, chronic pancreatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. In addition, damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from chronic alcohol abuse. The long-term use of alcohol is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body. The developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the developing fetal brain is also vulnerable, and <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> spectrum disorders (FASDs) may result if pregnant mothers consume alcohol.|$|E
25|$|However, recent animal {{research}} has shown a correlation between paternal alcohol exposure and decreased offspring birth weight. Behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, and lowered stress tolerance {{have been linked to}} paternal alcohol ingestion. The compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses to stress that children with <b>Fetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> Syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use. These birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects (VSD) at birth. VSD has also been correlated with paternal alcohol abuse in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{spectrum}} {{disorders are}} caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Surveys from the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% drank {{at some point during}} the pregnancy. About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are alcoholics. The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed. Other risk factors include an older mother, smoking, and poor diet. There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy. While drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues. Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is a more}} important factor rather than average alcohol intake, {{with regard to the}} severity of alcohol induced damage to the fetus. Alcohol has definite long-term adverse effects on the fetus, in particular impaired attentional skills and may lead to psychiatric disorders when the child grows up. Approximately one in five nonpregnant women binge-drinks and one in 25 pregnant women binge-drinks. Binge drinking during pregnancy is associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects as well as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. The affected children after birth can suffer mental retardation and problems with learning, memory, attention, problem solving and problems with mental health and social interactions. Deformities in facial features, skeletal and body organs as well as a smaller head circumference are also sometimes present in these children. Studies in sheep indicate that fetal neurotoxicity induced by alcohol may be due to acidaemia and hypercapnia. Binge drinking three or more times during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{syndrome}} (FAS) is {{the first}} diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess {{each of the four}} key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.|$|E
25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to “environmental stressors and risk factors.” Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers “unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.” In Vos’ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are “likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, <b>fetal</b> <b>alcohol</b> syndrome, or AIDS.” Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother’s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and “living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).” In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.|$|E
