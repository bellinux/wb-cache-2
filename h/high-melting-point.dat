Several lines of evidence {{have been used to}} implicate elevated proportions of these <b>high-melting-point</b> molecular species as a major cause of plant chilling sensitivity. In the fatty acid biosynthesis 1 (fab 1) mutant of Arabidopsis, leaf phosphatidylglycerol contained 43 % <b>high-melting-point</b> molecular species[mdash]a higher percentage than is found in many chilling-sensitive plants. Nevertheless, the mutant was completely unaffected (when compared with wild-type controls) by a range of low-temperature treatments that quickly led to the death of cucumber and other chilling-sensitive plants. Our results clearly demonstrate that <b>high-melting-point</b> phosphatidylglycerols do not mediate classic chilling damage. However, growth of fab 1 plants was compromised by long-term (> 2 weeks) exposure to 2 [deg]C. This finding and other observations are consistent with a proposition that plants native to tropical and subtropical regions have evolved many traits that are incompatible with long-term growth or development in cooler climates but that may confer selective advantages at high temperatures...|$|E

In our research, a pneumatic drop-on-demand (DOD) generator was developed which can spray A 2024 alloy successfully, and the maximum ejection temperature can reach to 1200 ℃. Experiments were conducted to examine the influence of the oxygen content on the metal droplet spray. The uniform A 2024 droplet was ejected stably under the condition where the oxygen content was less than 25 ppm. As the solenoid valve was opened once with different time span, four cases were observed: droplet stream, three droplets, two droplets and one single droplet. A 2024 droplets were deposited continuously {{on top of each other}} in vertical direction to form vertical columns, which meant the graphite nozzle can be used in experiment.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to develop an accurate dynamic technique which, in a microgravity environment, would enable performance of thermophysical measurements on <b>high-melting-point</b> electrically conducting substances in their liquid state. In spite of the critical need in high temperature technologies related to spacecraft, nuclear reactors, effects of power laser radiation, and in validating theoretical models in related areas, no accurate data on thermophysical properties exist. This is primarily due to the limitation of the reliable steady-state techniques to temperatures below about 2000 K, and the accurate millisecond-resolution pulse heating techniques to the solid state of the specimen. The limitation of the millisecond-resolution techniques to temperatures below the melting point {{stems from the fact}} that the specimen collapses due to the gravitational force once it starts to melt. The rationale for the use of the microgravity is that by performing the dynamic experiments in a microgravity environment the specimen will retain its geometry, and thus it will be possible to extend the accurate thermophysical measurements to temperatures above the melting point of <b>high-melting-point</b> substances...|$|E

A fab 1 suppressor line, S 7, was isolated in a screen that identified mutants that remained alive after 16 weeks at 2 °C {{and were able to}} flower and produce seed after return to 22 °C. Relative to wild type, S 7 plants had reduced levels of 16 : 3 fatty acid in leaf galactolipids, indicating reduced synthesis of chloroplast glycerolipids by the prokaryotic pathway of lipid metabolism. The suppressor mutation was identified, by map-based and candidate-gene approaches, as a hypomorphic allele of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 1 (lpat 1), lpat 1 - 3. LPAT 1 encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the second reaction in the prokaryotic pathway. Several lines of evidence indicate that damage and death of fab 1 plants at 2 °C may be a result of the increased proportion of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in fab 1 that are <b>high-melting-point</b> molecular species (containing only 16 : 0, 18 : 0, and 16 : 1,Δ 3 -trans fatty acids). Consistent with this proposal, the lpat 1 - 3 mutation strongly affects the fatty acid composition of PG. The proportion of <b>high-melting-point</b> molecular species in PG is reduced from 48. 2 % in fab 1 to 10. 7 % in fab 1 lpat 1 - 3 (S 7), a value close to the 7. 6 % found in wild type...|$|E

The pressure signal {{can be read}} out wirelessly through the magnetic coupling between the reader antenna and the sensor due to that the sensor is equivalent to an inductive-capacitive (LC) resonance circuit which has a pressure-sensitive resonance frequency. Considering the excellent mechanical properties in high-temperature environment, multilayered zirconia ceramic tapes were used to fabricate the pressure-sensitive structure. Owing to its low resistivity, sliver paste was chosen to form the electrical circuit via post-fire metallization, thereby enhancing the quality factor compared to sensors fabricated by cofiring with a <b>high-melting-point</b> metal such as platinum, tungsten or manganese.

40|$|W alloys are {{currently}} widely studied materials for their potential application in future fusion reactors. In the presented study, {{we report on}} the preparation and properties of mechanically alloyed W-Ti powders compacted by pulsed electric current sintering. Four different powder compositions of W-(3 %– 7 %) Ti with Hf or HfC were prepared.

The bending strength of the alloys depends on the amount of Ti added. The addition of 3 wt. % Ti led to an increase whereas 7 wt. % Ti led to a major decrease in strength when compared to unalloyed tungsten sintered at similar conditions. The addition of Ti significantly lowered the room-temperature thermal conductivity of all prepared materials. However, unlike pure tungsten, the conductivity of the prepared alloys increased with the temperature. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the alloys at 1300 °C approached the value of the unalloyed tungsten...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Controlling {{the crystal}} quality and growth {{orientation}} of high performance III−V compound semiconductor nanowires (NWs) in a large-scale synthesis is still challenging, which could restrict {{the implementation of}} nanowires for practical applications. Here we present a facile approach to control the crystal structure, defects, orientation, growth rate and density of GaAs NWs via a supersaturation-controlled engineering process by tailoring the chemical composition and dimension of starting AuxGay catalysts. For the high Ga supersaturation (catalyst diameter 30 %), whereas for the low Ga supersaturation (catalyst diameter> 40 nm), NWs are grown inevitably with a mixed crystal orientation and high concentration of defects from <b>high-melting-point</b> alloys (Au 7 Ga 2 with Ga atomic concentration < 30 %). In addition to the complicated control of processing parameters, the ability to tune the composition of catalytic alloys by tailoring the starting Au film thickness demonstrates a versatile approach to control the crystal quality and orientation for the uniform NW growth.

40|$|Prior to the {{large-scale}} preparation {{of any new}} chemical formulation {{an assessment of the}} potential reactivity between the components must be carried out. This practice, which is common to many fields including pharmaceutical science, is particularly essential in the case of energetic formulations whose chemical incompatibility may result in an unexpected and potentially explosive decomposition. The common method used to investigate incompatibility is to heat 1 : 1 (w/w) formulations and evaluate the variation in their thermal stability with respect to the neat, pristine explosive. The techniques used are: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vacuum stability and heat flow calorimetry. As trends in energetics move towards safer formulations the components are more commonly selected for their high thermal stability and low sensitivity to initiation. However, recently prepared thermoplastic formulations which incorporate a thermally stable explosive, 2, 2 ’, 4, 4 ’, 6, 6 ’-hexanitrostilbene (HNS II), and a selection of <b>high-melting-point</b> thermoplastics produced anomalous results during their compatibility assessment leading to the suggestion that historical tests originally devised for less thermally stable materials, such as N,N’,N’’-trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazacyclohexane (RDX), may not be directly transferable to the newer generations of insensitive explosive formulations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of biodiesel was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The {{cold filter plugging point}} of biodiesel was measured according to GB/T 20828 - 2007. The cold flow properties of biodiesel were investigated {{on the basis}} of the crystallization theory, including {{chemical composition}} and molecular structure. Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, <b>high-melting-point</b> saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The cold flow properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The long-straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters tend to have relatively poor cold flow properties. The cold flow properties worsen with increasing the amount and carbon chain length of straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The ways of adjusting biodiesel composition and treating with depression of cold filter plugging point were given; they could improve cold flow properties. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{followed}} {{the progression of}} lipolysis in Emmental cheese by quantifying the concentrations of individual free fatty acids (FFA) released during ripening {{in each of the}} different rooms: 12 days at 12 °C, 28 days at 21 °C, and 8 days at 4 °C. Lipolysis, which corresponded to 1. 56 % of fat, mainly occurred in the 21 and 4 °C rooms, with 68 and 16. 5 % of total FFA, respectively. The nonselectivity of lipolytic enzymes was evidenced: all fatty acids were released with level of g 1 %. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that the thermal properties of cheese were affected by (i) lipolysis of fat, that is, the monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and FFA that may be localized at the fat/whey interface, and/or by (ii) hydrolysis of <b>high-melting-point</b> triacylglycerols constituted mainly by long-chain saturated fatty acids (e. g., palmitic acid). Analysis of the cheese microstructure was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fat globules were mainly disrupted after pressing of curd grains, leading to the release of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM); fat inclusions were surrounded by pockets of whey, delimited by casein strands. Moreover, colonies of bacteria were preferentially localized in situ at the fat/protein interface. This study showed that both the localization of bacteria and the supramolecular organization of fat which was not protected by the MFGM can help the accessibility of milk fat to lipolytic enzymes and then contribute to the quality of cheese...|$|E
40|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} {{provide a}} means for converting heat into electrical power using a fully solid-state device. Power-generating devices (which include individual couples as well as multicouple modules) {{require the use of}} ntype and p-type thermoelectric materials, typically comprising highly doped narrow band-gap semiconductors which are connected to a heat collector and electrodes. To achieve greater device efficiency and greater specific power will require using new thermoelectric materials, in more complex combinations. One such material is the p-type compound semiconductor Yb 14 MnSb 11 (YMS), which has been demonstrated to have one of the highest ZT values at 1, 000 C, the desired operational temperature of many space-based radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Despite the favorable attributes of the bulk YMS material, it must ultimately be incorporated into a power-generating device using a suitable joining technology. Typically, processes such as diffusion bonding and/or brazing are used to join thermoelectric materials to the heat collector and electrodes, with the goal of providing a stable, ohmic contact with high thermal conductivity at the required operating temperature. Since YMS is an inorganic compound featuring chemical bonds with a mixture of covalent and ionic character, simple metallurgical diffusion bonding is difficult to implement. Furthermore, the Sb within YMS readily reacts with most metals to form antimonide compounds {{with a wide range of}} stoichiometries. Although choosing metals that react to form <b>high-melting-point</b> antimonides could be employed to form a stable reaction bond, it is difficult to limit the reactivity of Sb in YMS such that the electrode is not completely consumed at an operating temperature of 1, 000 C.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have many}} material properties {{that make them}} attractive for applications(1, 2). In the context of nanoelectronics(3), interest has focused on single-walled carbon nanotubes(4) (SWNTs) because slight changes in tube diameter and wrapping angle, defined by the chirality indices (n,m), will shift their electrical conductivity from one characteristic of a metallic state to one characteristic of a semiconducting state, and will also change the bandgap. However, this structure-function relationship can be fully exploited only with structurally pure SWNTs. Solution-based separation methods(5) yield tubes within a narrow structure range, but {{the ultimate goal of}} producing just one type of SWNT by controlling its structure during growth {{has proved to be a}} considerable challenge over the last two decades(6 - 9). Such efforts aim to optimize the composition(6, 10 - 17) or shape(18 - 21) of the catalyst particles that are used in the chemical vapour deposition synthesis process to decompose the carbon feedstock and influence SWNT nucleation and growth(22 - 25). This approach resulted in the highest reported proportion, 55 per cent, of single-chirality SWNTs in an as-grown sample(11). Here we show that SWNTs of a single chirality, (12, 6), can be produced directly with an abundance higher than 92 per cent when using tungsten-based bimetallic alloy nanocrystals as catalysts. These, unlike other catalysts used so far, have such high melting points that they maintain their crystalline structure during the chemical vapour deposition process. This feature seems crucial because experiment and simulation both suggest that the highly selective growth of (12, 6) SWNTs is the result of a good structural match between the carbon atom arrangement around the nanotube circumference and the arrangement of the catalytically active atoms in one of the planes of the nanocrystal catalyst. We anticipate that using <b>high-melting-point</b> alloy nanocrystals with optimized structures as catalysts paves the way for total chirality control in SWNT growth and will thus promote the development of SWNT applications.
