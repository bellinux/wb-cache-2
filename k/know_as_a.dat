500|$|Lee {{reported}} that the work was simply a display of one's love for their country and an expression of joy at Singapore's success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be [...] "treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon". When interviewed by The New Paper, he said [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> citizen {{that we are not}} allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist." [...] He also complained about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a national flag made of hair at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Lee felt the use of hair to create the nation's flag meant that the flag was in the wrong colours, and was distasteful.|$|E
500|$|The central premise {{behind the}} story of [...] "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor" [...] was to {{showcase}} both the true danger posed by the Flood and {{the inner workings of}} the Covenant military machine, to dispel the image that the Covenant [...] "simply stand around waiting for the Chief to blast them". The story was written by Lee Hammock with art provided by Simon Bisley. Hammock described the process of writing the story as a [...] "heady task" [...] since he had to respect Halo fans' knowledge of the characters and canon, ensuring that [...] "characters that [...] <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of themselves are portrayed aptly". These difficulties were mitigated by the knowledge that fans were not as intimately connected to the history of the character of Rtas as they were to the likes of the Master Chief; this allowed ample room to expand 'Vadumee's background in sync with the Halo canon while permitting the writer to [...] "bring something new to the table".|$|E
500|$|Brent Spiner {{returned}} to the Star Trek franchise, having previously played the character of Data in [...] In Enterprise he {{played the role of}} Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Following [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] on the Sgt. Pepper album (as first {{released}} on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced Beatles studio chatter. The frequency is {{best understood as}} what we <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dog whistle as the frequency is {{picked up by a}} dog's ear and was part of their humour. They joked about picturing barking dogs should they be present when the album would finish. [...] Recorded two months after the mono and stereo masters for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] had been finalised, the studio chatter (titled in the session notes [...] "Edit for LP End") was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. There are even a few variations of the chatter, though the best known one is them saying during the laughter and chatter [...] "never could see any other way." [...] The Anthology 2 album includes an early, pre-orchestral version of the song and Anthology 3 includes a version of [...] "The End" [...] that concludes by having the last note fade into the final chord of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (reversed, then played forwards). The Love version has the song starting with Lennon's intro of [...] "sugar plum fairy", with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos.|$|E

2500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} how Dir en Grey have gained a {{significant}} international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said [...] "when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English and I {{had no idea}} what they were saying. But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E
