The optical p rop erties are determined with a maximu m relative error of 4 % (on the sum of the transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients), when the PCM lay er is either in comp lete solid state or liqu id state. The average error for all the op tical p rop erties is 2 %. Different thicknesses of the PCM lay er are used in order to assess the dep endency of the optical p rop erties on the PCM lay er thickness. The angular dep endency is also investigated for beam angle up to 45 deg...|$|E
40|$|Finding {{the proper}} {{trade-off}} between blocking direct sunlight, ensuring sufficient indoor daylighting and view {{out is a}} particularly delicate task especially in arid climates, due to harsh environmental conditions. As a tentative answer to this challenge, an adaptive shading and daylighting system (Shape Variable Mashrabiya - SVM) has been developed by the authors, described in an earlier paper. In this paper, we analyze how the SVM may affect annual lighting and global primary energy performance of an office building in Abu Dhabi: the SVM was applied to east and west façades and compared to external Venetian blinds, reflective and selective <b>glazin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many architects—and their clients—prefer {{buildings}} with all-glass façades. In most cases, such buildings use a single-skin façade consisting of fixed glazing (windows) {{that forms the}} outer surface of the building. Rela-tive to {{buildings with}} largely opaque façades, {{they tend to have}} higher space conditioning loads from heat transfer through the building envelope because windows pose less resistance to heat transfer than insulated walls. Recently, building designers in the U. S. have begun to use double-skin façades (DSF) to attempt to improve the thermal energy performance of façades of buildings with high glaz-ing fractions. DSF first came into use in the 1970 s and have primarily been used in European buildings since. 1, 2 Compared to a single-skin façade, a DSF consists of an external glazing offset from an internal glazing integrated into a curtain wall, often with a controllable shading system located in the cavity between the two glazing systems. Typically, the external <b>glazin...</b>|$|E
