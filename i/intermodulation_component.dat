40|$|It is {{critically}} important in designing RF receiver front ends to handle high power jammers and other strong interferers. Instead of blocking incoming energy or dissipating it as heat, we investigate the possibility of redirecting that energy for harvesting and storage. The approach is based on channelizing a high power signal into a previously unknown circuit element {{which serves as a}} passive intermodulation device. This <b>intermodulation</b> <b>component</b> must produce a hysteretic current-voltage curve to be useful as an energy harvester. Here we demonstrate a method by which carbon nanotube transistors produce the necessary hysteretic I-V curves. Such devices can be tailored to the desired frequency by introducing functional groups to the nanotubes. These effects controllably enhance the desired behavior, namely, hysteretic nonlinearity in the transistors’ I-V characteristic. Combining these components with an RF energy harvester may one day enable the reuse of inbound jamming energy for standard back end radio components...|$|E

Steady-state visual evoked fields (SSVEF) {{were recorded in}} MEG while observers reported their bound or unbound perception of moving bars arranged in a square shape. By using pairs of oscillating vertical and horizontal bars, "frequency-tagged" at f 1 and f 2, we identified a region with enhanced sustained power at 2 f 1 + 2 f 2 intermodulation frequency correlated with perceptual reports. Intermodulation power is more important during perceptual form/motion integration than during the perceptual segmentation of the stimulus into individual component motions, indicating that intermodulation frequency power is a neuromarker of form/motion integration. Source reconstruction of cortical activities at the relevant frequencies further reveals well segregated activity in the occipital lobe at the fundamental of the stimulation, f 1 and f 2, widely spread activity at 2 f 1 and 2 f 2 and a focal activity in the medial part of the right precentral sulcus region at the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>component,</b> 2 f 1 + 2 f 2.

40|$|Whether and how {{the parts}} of a visual object are grouped {{together}} to form an integrated ("holistic") representation is a central question in cognitive neuroscience. Although the face {{is considered to be}} the quintessential example of holistic representation, this issue {{has been the subject of}} much debate in face perception research. The implication of holistic processing is that the response to the whole cannot be predicted from the sum of responses to the parts. Here we apply techniques from nonlinear systems analysis to provide an objective measure of the nonlinear integration of parts into a whole, using the left and right halves of a face stimulus as the parts. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 15 human participants presented with two halves of a face stimulus, flickering at different frequencies (5. 88 vs. 7. 14 Hz). Besides specific responses at these fundamental frequencies, reflecting part-based responses, we found <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> (e. g., 7. 14 - 5. 88 = 1. 26 Hz) over the right occipito-temporal hemisphere, reflecting nonlinear integration of the face halves. Part-based responses did not depend on the relative alignment of the two face halves, their spatial separation, or whether the face was presented upright or inverted. By contrast, intermodulations were virtually absent when the two halves were spatially misaligned and separated. Inversion of the whole face configuration also reduced specifically the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> over the right occipito-temporal cortex.

40|$|In {{order to}} isolate the {{repetition}} suppression effects for each part of a whole-face stimulus, {{the left and right}} halves of face stimuli were flickered at different frequency rates (5. 88 or 7. 14 Hz), changing or not changing identity at every stimulation cycle. The human electrophysiological (electroencephalographic) responses to each face half increased in amplitude when different rather than repeated face half identities were presented at every stimulation cycle. Contrary to the repetition suppression effects for whole faces, which are usually found over the right occipito-temporal cortex, these part-based repetition suppression effects were found on all posterior electrode sites and were unchanged when the two face halves were manipulated by separation, lateral misalignment, or inversion. In contrast, <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> (e. g. 7. 14 - 5. 88 = 1. 26 Hz) were found mainly over the right occipito-temporal cortex and were significantly reduced following the aforementioned manipulations. In addition, the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> decreased substantially for face halves belonging to different identities, which form a less coherent face than when they belong to the same face identity.

40|$|Abstract — Nonlinear devices, such {{as power}} amplifiers, {{typically}} generate spurious signal <b>components</b> known as <b>intermodulations.</b> This phenomenon {{is particularly important}} when multiple signals, allocated at different frequencies, pass through nonlinear devices simultaneously. In this paper we extend a known fast counting algorithm (FCA) of <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> and compare it with other counting algorithms. The results obtained show significant improvement on the processing time. The carrier configuration is modelled by using indicator polynomials. We show that the distribution of high order intermodulation products can be computed in a reduced amount of time, by extending the algorithmic results relevant to third order intermodulations. In addition, we notice that in particular situations even order intermodulations are also important. They occupy the adjacent harmonic zones, generally allocated to other services, so that the achievable performance deteriorates. We extend an algorithm which computes the position of even and odd order intermodulations, and we make it faster and computationally more efficient. These results may improve both the optimisation of the spectrum shape and {{the analysis of the}} nonlinear effects.

40|$|Previous {{approach}} for narrowband interference cancellation based on compressed sensing (CS) in wideband receivers uses orthogonal projections to project {{away from the}} interference. This is not effective {{in the presence of}} nonlinear LNA (low noise amplifier) and finite bit ADCs (analog-to-digital converters) {{due to the fact that}} the nonidealities present will result in irresolvable <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> and corrupt the signal reconstruction. Cancelling out the interferer before reaching the LNA thus becomes very important. A CS measurement matrix with randomly placed zeros in the frequency domain helps in this regard by removing the effect of interference when the signal measurements are performed before the LNA. Using this idea, under much idealized hardware assumptions impressive performance is obtained. The use of binary sequences which makes the hardware implementation simplistic is investigated in this thesis. Searching sequences with many spectral nulls turns out to be nontrivial. A theoretical {{approach for}} estimating probability of nulls is provided to reduce significant computational effort in the search and is shown to be close to actual search iterations.

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of chords {{is being investigated}} and several methods has been proved. A method using spectral pattern recognition has been presented previously by the authors. In that method, the chord is detected iteratively, note by note, {{by means of a}} set of patterns generated by an acoustical model of the piano. In each iteration step, the spectral components of the detected note are eliminated from the signal spectrum using a mask related with the pattern of that note. When a "staccato" chord is played on a piano, the string is struck with a higher velocity and the excitation becomes more non-linear. As a result, <b>intermodulation</b> <b>components</b> appears in the spectrum. Taken into consideration the inharmonicity of the string vibration, the effect of those intermodulation products is a widening of each spectral component of the chord. This widening must be considered when the patterns and masks are applied during the identification process. We have found out that this widening varies with the partial and the note. It also depends on the octave (differences in hammer felt dimensions and stiffness) and on the force applied to the key ("piano", "mezzoforte" or "forte") A model for the calculation of the widening due to non-linearity is presented in this contribution.
