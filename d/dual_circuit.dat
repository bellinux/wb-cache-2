25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted <b>dual</b> <b>circuit</b> brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressurized}} air {{comes from an}} air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars. The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence {{the loss of the}} force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a <b>dual</b> <b>circuit</b> system, usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, the Corvair {{line was}} trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model {{year was the}} first with a {{collapsible}} steering column. A <b>dual</b> <b>circuit</b> master cylinder with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, [...] "mushroomed" [...] instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same [...] "Astro" [...] style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. [...] Chevrolet introduced a [...] engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an [...] "I Love My Corvair" [...] bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.|$|E

2500|$|The Bode {{equaliser}} can {{be converted}} into a constant resistance filter by using the entire Bode network as the Z branch of a Zobel network, resulting in a rather complex network of bridge T networks embedded in a larger bridge T. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this results in the same transfer function by noting that the transfer function of the Bode equaliser is identical to the transfer function of the general form of Zobel equaliser. [...] Note that the dual of a constant resistance bridge T network is the identical network. [...] The dual of a Bode network is therefore the same network except for the load resistance RL, which must be the inverse, RL', in the <b>dual</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] To adjust the equaliser RL and RL' must be ganged, or otherwise kept in step such that as RL increases RL' will decrease and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist automatic transmission fluid (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional hypoid gear oil. This <b>dual</b> <b>circuit</b> lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles. It has a torque handling limit of up to , and engine power outputs of up to [...] It has a total mass, including all lubricants and the dual-mass flywheel of [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{mobility}} {{analogy is}} one of the two main mechanical-electrical analogies used for representing mechanical systems in the electrical domain, the other being the impedance analogy. The roles of voltage and current are reversed in these two methods, and the electrical representations produced are the <b>dual</b> <b>circuits</b> of each other. The mobility analogy preserves the topology of the mechanical system when transferred to the electrical domain whereas the impedance analogy does not. On the other hand, the impedance analogy preserves the analogy between electrical impedance and mechanical impedance whereas the mobility analogy does not.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{effectively}} restrain the high-frequency harmonic components in compensation current {{and reduce the}} reactive power compensation claim to the dc voltage amplitude, we present a new topology of Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). This method changes the property of impedance by connecting capacitor in ac branch. Then, the evolution relation between new and traditional topologies of STATCOM is analyzed by the theory of circuit, and the decoupling mathematical model is deduced. Its dynamic and steady performance indexes, such as the dc voltage amplitude and total harmonic distortion of current (THDi), are better than traditional topology. Finally, the simulation results correspond well with the theoretical analysis. Keywords-STATCOM; series filter; decoupling control; <b>dual</b> <b>circuits.</b> I...|$|R

5000|$|A small {{selection}} of the many circuits that can be constructed with planar transmission lines are shown in the figure. Microstrip and slotline forms of directional couplers are shown at A and B respectively. [...] Generally, a circuit form in conducting lines like stripline or microstrip has a dual form in dielectric line such as slotline or finline with {{the roles of the}} conductor and insulator reversed. The line widths of the two formats are related by a reciprocal function; narrow conducting lines result in high impedance, but in dielectric lines the result is low impedance.

40|$|AbstractWe {{explore the}} {{structure}} of the maximum vertex independence sets in fullerenes: plane trivalent graphs with pentagonal and hexagonal faces. At the same time, we will consider benzenoids: plane graphs with hexagonal faces and one large outer face. In the case of fullerenes, a maximum vertex independence set may constructed as follows: (i) Pair up the pentagonal faces. (ii) Delete the edges of a shortest path in the dual joining the paired faces to get a bipartite subgraph of the fullerene. (iii) Each of the deleted edges will join two vertices in the same cell of the bipartition; eliminating one endpoint of each of the deleted edges results in two independent subsets. The main part of this paper is devoted to showing that for a properly chosen pairing, the larger of these two independent subsets will be a maximum independent set. We also prove that the construction of a maximum vertex independence set in a benzenoid is similar with the dual paths between pentagonal faces replaced by <b>dual</b> <b>circuits</b> through the outside face. At the end of the paper, we illustrate this method by computing the independence number for each of the icosahedral fullerenes...|$|R
