The results of this study found that responsiveness, competency, courtesy and credibility <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving a significant impact to public satisfaction; whereas real evidence, test power and easiness of accessing <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> not giving significant impact to public trust. The variable of responsiveness and credibility <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving significant effect toward public trust; meanwhile, the real evidence, test power, competence, courtesy, and easiness of accessing <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving significant impact toward public trust. The public <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> giving no significant impact on trust of satisfaction.

5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} procedures are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which <b>is</b> <b>directly</b> applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and <b>is</b> <b>directly</b> applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E
