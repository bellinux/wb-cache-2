25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> for {{assembly}} <b>automation</b> (DFAA) is {{an important}} part of the concurrent engineering strategy for reduction of product manufacturing costs and lead times. An intelligent knowledge-based system (KBS) for <b>design</b> for <b>automation</b> and early cost modelling within a concurrent engineering environment has been developed.

The system framework encompasses an extensive knowledge-based reasoning system, a CAD system, a <b>design</b> analysis for <b>automation</b> module, a <b>design</b> improvement suggestion module, and a user interface. The development process of the system involved three main stages: creating the KBS, developing the design improvement module, and integrating the KBS with the CAD system. The developed system has the capability to: (a) select the most economic assembly technique for the product at an early design stage; (b) estimate the assembly time and cost for manual, automatic, and robotic assembly methods; and (c) analyse the product <b>design</b> for <b>automation</b> and provide the designers with design improvement suggestions of a product to simplify assembly operations without any compromise of the product functionality.
