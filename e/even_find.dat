25|$|Dr. Liz Wilson is Garfield's {{veterinarian}} and {{a long-time}} crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona {{and almost always}} reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can <b>even</b> <b>find</b> it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.|$|E
25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. Or perhaps he might <b>even</b> <b>find</b> a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself forty years old was not lost on its audience.|$|E

25|$|The first Chinese in Oakland {{fished in}} the San Francisco Bay for shrimp {{similarly}} to the Chinese at China Camp near San Rafael. In 1868, Chinese laborers built the Temescal Dam in Oakland providing {{water for the}} East Bay {{as well as the}} Lake Chabot Dam in 1874-75. They worked in canneries, cotton mills and fuse and explosive factories as well as farms. In the 1880s, discriminatory laws made it difficult for Chinese immigrants to own land or <b>even</b> <b>find</b> work. They found work as laundry workers, cooks, gardeners, houseboys, or as vegetable peddlers. The Chinese Exclusion Act severely limited the further immigration of Chinese. By 1900, the Chinese in Oakland numbered less than 1,000.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} of the film, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{released}} a statement expressing concern over Borat's characteristic anti-Semitism. Both Baron Cohen (who is Jewish) and the ADL have stated that the film uses the title character to expose prejudices felt or tolerated by others, but the ADL expressed concern that some audiences might remain oblivious to this aspect of the film's humor, while [...] "some may <b>even</b> <b>find</b> it reinforcing their bigotry".|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} state {{repression}} and surveillance, the masses have become soft and restless. A spirit of resistance against the machines arises, {{and the new}} generation of rulers shifts course. After the end of the twenty-fourth century, access to science and technology is opened up again and nationalism reemerges, alongside a quasi-religious devotion to the machines. Later, researchers led by a scientist named Meki invent synthetic food production, which leads to the abandonment of farms and the countryside, a new wave of urbanization, and the solidification of the Senates' political control. By the twenty-seventh century, freed from the need to support themselves the masses have again become fat, idle, and restless; it becomes increasingly difficult to <b>even</b> <b>find</b> enough people to run the synthetic food factories. A group of leaders incite nationalism and war to combat this tendency; the result is a catastrophic world war between Europe and Asia—the [...] "Ural War"—involving advanced weapons that are able to channel the elements and that turn much of Russia into a wall of fire, and then into a flooded plain. After the war the states of Europe grow increasingly isolated from each other, and [...] "every cityscape fought for its existence." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "Possibly the best Simpsons episode, with a {{constant}} stream of gags, inspired animation (in particular the sequence when Homer begins to see and hear Moe everywhere, from Maggie's gurgles to the leaves on the trees), and a superb plot that twists about in every direction but the one you might expect." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "From Lisa’s slumber party at the opening through the Cheers spoof at Moe’s, this episode’s another real winner. Homer gets some of his all-time best lines, including a great run where he mocks Marge’s attempts to have him accept his fate. We <b>even</b> <b>find</b> a great twist on Bart’s prank phone calls when he asks for “Hugh Jass”. All in all, “Flaming” provides a terrific show." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode 5/5, calling it [...] "another great chapter in the history of The Simpsons, with tons of laughs throughout." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a very funny episode" [...] and highlighted the plot's focus on Moe as [...] "an example of the show gradually expanding its supporting townspeople into characters in their own right," [...] as [...] "Moe was just an angry bartender before this episode. After this one, he's the sad man who sometimes tastes success but always lets it slip away because of his inability {{to do the right thing}} until it's too late." [...] VanDerWerff also interpreted the episode as a metaphor for Simon's relationship with fellow The Simpsons developers Groening and James L. Brooks and Simon's belief that he was not receiving enough credit for The Simpsons.|$|E

2500|$|Off-Off-Broadway {{began in}} Greenwich Village in 1958 as a {{reaction}} to Off Broadway, and a [...] "complete rejection of commercial theatre". Among the first venues for what would soon be called [...] "Off-Off-Broadway" [...] (a term supposedly coined by critic Jerry Tallmer of the Village Voice) were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to <b>even</b> <b>find</b> out much about the content.

2500|$|A {{bottleneck}} in a person's cognitive navigational {{system could}} be disastrous, for instance if there were need for a sudden detour on a long road trip. And yet, people are still capable of getting place to place functionally. Lack of experience in a locale, or simply sheer size, can disorient one's mental layout, especially in a large and unfamiliar place with lots of overwhelming stimuli. In these environments people are still able to orient themselves, and <b>even</b> <b>find</b> their way around using landmarks. This ability to [...] "prioritize objects and regions in complex scenes for selection (and) recognition" [...] was labeled by Chun and Jiang in 1998. Landmarks give people guidance by activating [...] "learned associations between the global context and target locations." [...] Mallot and Gillner (2000) showed that subjects learned an association between a specific landmark and {{the direction of a}} turn, thereby furthering the relationship between associations and landmarks. Shelton and McNamara (2001) succinctly summed up why landmarks, as markers, are so helpful: [...] "location...cannot be described without making reference to the orientation of the observer." ...|$|E

Steve Pond of Reuters theorised that W.E. probably would not help in [...] "turning Madonna's faltering movie career". Kyle Buchanan of New York wondered whether W.E. would receive any significant film related awards, as predicted by industry prognosticators. He concluded that the film [...] "still may , but to judge {{from some of the}} vicious pans coming out of Venice today, it might have longer legs as a Razzie front-runner." [...] Daily Mails Baz Bamigboye gave the film a mostly positive review, saying that [...] "A lot of people will loathe it, simply because it’s been made by Madonna. But if people were to watch it with no knowledge of who directed, they would be pleasantly surprised. They might <b>even</b> <b>find</b> much of it enjoyable." [...] David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three stars and a mixed review stating that, [...] "Madonna's W.E. is a bold and confident story about an American woman's obsession with the Windsors." [...] Gritten complimented Riseborough and Cornish's acting but felt that the film looked like a commercial of expensive items, thus making it appeal to younger women for its fashion portrayal.|$|E
