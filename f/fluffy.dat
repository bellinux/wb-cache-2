5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as <b>fluffy</b> extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E
5|$|Alfe (pronounced Alfé) is a large, <b>fluffy,</b> man–dog–anteater {{found and}} raised by Horace when both were young. He loves devouring large {{quantities}} of food, especially pizza, and acts impulsively during missions.

Horace is the calm and collected leader of the team, usually applying common sense with his detective work and caring after Alfe.|$|E
50|$|This tool is {{commonly}} used to rice potatoes. Because the starch isn't activated {{as it is in}} mashing, the resulting potatoes are lighter and <b>fluffier.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is the {{intention}} of Stoats to [...] "modernise porridge". Stoats founder Tony Stone said that Stoats' recipe makes it lighter and <b>fluffier</b> with a much better texture.|$|R

5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} inadvertently and {{thought to be}} edible {{due to the fact}} that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its <b>fluffy</b> cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.|$|E

2500|$|Afro-textured hair strands can possess [...] "torsion twists", {{where the}} hair strand turns around itself. These torsion twists may prevent the hair strands from coiling into tight curls, instead {{separating}} them {{and allowing the}} hair as a whole to have a <b>fluffier,</b> more undefined look.|$|R
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The <b>fluffy</b> baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} studio album by the English punk rock band <b>Fluffy,</b> released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a <b>fluffy</b> appearance.|$|E
50|$|Small nestlings are pale grey with buffy {{down on the}} neck, and a black crown. At {{fledging}} age, the {{immature bird}} {{is identical to the}} adult except for a feathered forehead, much lesser iridescence on feathers, and much longer and <b>fluffier</b> feathers on the neck.|$|R
50|$|The potato, {{although}} a late introduction to Finland, features {{heavily in the}} diet and has {{found its way into}} many kinds of breads. Usually dough made with potato will be very soft and the bread will be moister and <b>fluffier</b> than plain wheat or oat bread.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} filling is made {{of crushed}} white cheese (sirene, feta cheese), yogurt, and eggs. Sometimes baking soda {{is added to the}} yogurt, which makes it rise (as the baking soda reacts with the acid in yogurt). The addition of baking soda results in a <b>fluffier</b> filling.|$|R
5|$|The {{juvenile}} T.l. ludovicianus {{is similar}} in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped wing coverts, a superciliary streak is less white, a <b>fluffy</b> vent and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) without bars. In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults {{in the same time}} period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.|$|E
5|$|They {{are known}} for their {{elongated}} record titles, usually inspired by B movies. They have released three EPs, How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?

5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a <b>fluffy</b> white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
50|$|Veka (bułka paryska or bułka francuska) is {{a pastry}} {{produced}} in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. Its character {{is similar to}} French baguette although the veka is wider, bigger, and <b>fluffier</b> and has smoother surface. It is made of wheat flour. Its weight is about 350 grams.|$|R
50|$|Countess of Monte Crisco- Another antagonist. She helped normalman {{get home}} only {{so she could}} get <b>Fluffy's</b> {{slippers}} and become super powerful.

50|$|In most Nepalese cuisines, the curds are {{wrapped in}} cloth, placed under a heavy weight {{such as a}} stone slab {{for two to three}} hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, <b>fluffier</b> cheese.|$|R
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and <b>fluffy,</b> remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with <b>fluffy</b> white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E
5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's <b>Fluffy?</b> playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
50|$|Japonica rice grains are rounder, thicker, and harder, {{compared}} to longer, thinner, and <b>fluffier</b> Indica rice grains. Japonica rice is also stickier {{due to the}} higher content of amylopectin, whereas Indica rice starch consists of less amylopectin and more amylose. Japonica rice plants are shorter than Indica rice plants.|$|R
50|$|The {{researchers}} {{suggest that}} an Ina eruption would have also produced magmatic foam. And {{because of the}} Moon's decreased gravity and nearly absent atmosphere, the lunar foam {{would have been even}} <b>fluffier</b> than on Earth, so it's expected that the structures within Ina are even more porous than on Earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of {{baking powder and}} other chemical leavening agents during the 19th century substantially increased the flexibility of this traditional pound cake by introducing the possibility of creating lighter, <b>fluffier</b> cakes using these traditional combinations of ingredients, {{and it is this}} transformation that brought about the modern butter cake.|$|R
