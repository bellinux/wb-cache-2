Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly stated that the video should have been more creative and called it offensive, stating that Minaj's appearance was the best part. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone commented that the video was morbid, comparing it to [...] "Thriller", though noted that [...] "instead of dancing zombies, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> undead, barely dressed and occasionally dismembered models".

500|$|He next starred as {{the protagonist}} (Roshan Kalra) in the comedy-drama Chef, an {{official}} {{adaptation of the}} 2014 film of the same name, from the director Raja Krishna Menon. Khan was pleased to work with Menon and identified with the film due to its [...] "modern, slightly unorthodox take on relationships". He borrowed several real-life experiences for his character, and in preparation, trained at the JW Marriott Hotels in Mumbai. The film received generally positive reviews with several commentators believing that it was Khan's best performance to that point. Anupama Chopra wrote: [...] "Khan get his groove back... doesn’t play Roshan as a hero having a bad day. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a flawed, fumbling man {{who is trying to}} repair the broken chords of his life." [...] As with his last few releases, Rangoon and Chef earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal.|$|E
500|$|The University of California at Berkeley {{commissioned}} American neoclassical composer Roger Sessions (1896–1985) to set {{the poem}} as a cantata to commemorate their centennial anniversary in 1964. Sessions did not finish composing the work until the 1970s, dedicating it to the memories of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and political figure Robert F. Kennedy, both assassinated in 1968. Sessions first became acquainted with Leaves of Grass in 1921 and began setting the poem {{as a reaction to}} the death of his friend, George Bartlett, although none of the sketches from that early attempt survive. [...] He returned to the text almost fifty years later, composing a work scored for soprano, contralto, and baritone soloists, mixed chorus and orchestra. The music is described as responding [...] "wonderfully both to the Biblical majesty and musical fluidity of Whitman's poetry, and here to, in the evocation of the gray-brown bird singing from the swamp and of the over-mastering scent of the lilacs, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> one of the century's great love letters to Nature." ...|$|E

500|$|Bhardwaj {{has been}} {{influenced}} by many directorsincluding Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai, Quentin Tarantino and Francis Ford Coppolaand combines these influences in his work. Rakesh Bedi wrote that [...] "Bhardwaj keeps displaying his vision throughout the film". Reviewers have compared the film's multi-plot narrative to those of several films by Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and the Coen Brothers. Reviewers said that the film mostly belongs {{to the level of}} Pulp Fiction; Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called it [...] "Bollywood's first all-the-way-out-to-there pulp fiction". Bedi wrote, [...] "there's Buñuel in the Bengali dons, there's Kurosawa...in that surreal train car in which Charlie lives, there's Ray in money-floating dreams that Charlie has". Keshav Chaturvedi of the Hindustan Times compared the apocalyptical gang war in the climax to Apocalypse Now (1979). He said, [...] "Bhardwaj just demolishes the cliches of Bollywood. In ripping apart the stereotype, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a prototype: a Bollywood that deals with alienation,...angst,... and atrocity." [...] A review in The Times of India said that the film's climax reaches the level of Reservoir Dogs, and described it as [...] "absolutely riveting stuff, with the camera going on a hitherto unexplored journey in Indian cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|He joined York's Conference Premier rivals Barrow on a one-month loan on 23 October 2008, {{having made}} 15 {{appearances}} and scored three goals for York {{up to that}} point in 2008–09. After Brodie scored two goals on his debut for Barrow in a 4–0 away victory Tamworth in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, Barrow's joint-manager Darren Sheridan said [...] "He did well and <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> more options for the team. It was a great debut from him and we know there is still more to come in the next few games". This performance led to him being nominated as Player of the Round for the fourth qualifying round, which was eventually awarded to Sam Hatton of AFC Wimbledon. Barrow revealed that they were hoping to sign him permanently in January 2009 if his loan spell at the club proved successful. He made his league debut for Barrow in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green Rovers and he scored against Gateshead in the Conference League Cup third round for Barrow, the match finishing 3–1 after extra time. It was agreed for Brodie's loan at the club to be extended following the match, but York overturned this decision a day later. He made his final appearance for Barrow in a 1–0 home defeat to Weymouth on 22 November 2008, finishing the spell with seven appearances and four goals. He later ruled out the possibility of rejoining Barrow in January 2009, saying he was committed to York.|$|E
500|$|However, as {{the season}} progressed, head coach Seth Greenberg began giving Garland fewer minutes. Following the {{recovery}} of freshman Marquis Rankin from a torn meniscus, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs Norfolk State. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, [...] "Marquis [...] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to get other guys more minutes". When asked a similar question the day before, he said that [...] "you can't play 13 guys". On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on Twitter that {{he was planning to}} transfer out of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia. Garland became the third men's basketball player to transfer out of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to Valparaiso, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with Georgia State. Garland finished his sophomore year at Virginia Tech averaging 4.6 points, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 turnovers in eight appearances. In late December 2011, he began competing for La Salle. Explorers head coach John Giannini said, [...] "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> an experienced player to continue our growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." [...] Several of the team's top scorers in 2011–12 had experience playing high school basketball in the Philadelphia Public and Catholic Leagues.|$|E

Mosi Reeves from Spin criticized Gaga's [...] "wanna-be-M.I.A. cadences", calling it [...] "unnecessarily crass". Another review from Spin by Brandon Soderberg panned the song, saying that [...] "t wasn't a Wale song and it wasn't a Gaga song with Wale wedged in there somewhere, either. 'Chillin' became {{something of an}} Internet rap watershed moment". Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork Media described the song as [...] "much-maligned", adding that [...] "there won't be much to gain from ... This {{was the first step}} in Wale's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much—nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing here." [...] In another review, Ryan Dombal from the same website criticized Wale's repetition of his name and the usage of the samples calling it [...] "unnecessary". [...] Brian Howe from Paste described the track as [...] "flashy and hollow". The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap." [...] McBee believed that the songs did not represent {{the true nature of the}} album. Prefix magazine was also critical of the song saying that [...] "just when you think Wale understands the consequences of mindlessly horny partying... <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> the dumb, cheaply agreeable Lady Gaga feature 'Chillin'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Literary critic Harold Bloom {{argued that}} even though the word misandry is {{relatively}} unheard of in literature {{it is not hard to}} find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of Shakespeare Bloom argued [...] "I cannot think of one instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element.
