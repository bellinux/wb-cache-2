5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely <b>deflate</b> during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to <b>deflate.</b> The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the solution of}} large and sparse linear systems of equations by GM-RES. Due to the appearance of unfavorable eigenvalues in the spectrum of the coefficient matrix, the convergence of GMRES may hamper. To overcome this, a <b>deflated</b> variant of GMRES can be used, which treats those unfavorable eigenvalues effectively. In the literature, several <b>deflated</b> GMRES variants are applied successfully to various problems, while a theoretical justification is often lacking. In contrast to <b>deflated</b> CG, the convergence of <b>deflated</b> GMRES seems to be harder to analyze and to understand. This paper presents some new theoretical insights into <b>deflated</b> GMRES based on A-invariant deflation subspaces. Fundamental results regarding the convergence of <b>deflated</b> GMRES are proved {{in order to show}} the effectiveness and robustness of this method.

5|$|With longitudinal, {{transverse}} and radial muscles, polyps {{are able}} to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and <b>deflate,</b> and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend to feed and contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column. Contraction is achieved by pumping fluid out of the coelenteron, and reflation by drawing it in, a task performed by the siphonoglyphs in the pharynx which are lined with beating cilia. Most anthozoans adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some {{are able to}} detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment.

5|$|The American press {{exaggerated the}} {{encounter}} between Irene and the American ships, which prompted Diederichs {{to decide to}} send Irene away from the area to <b>deflate</b> tensions between the two countries. After returning to Manila and debarking the non-combatants, Irene was ordered to depart the Philippines. Irene relieved Arcona in Kiaochou, which was in turn ordered to steam to the Caroline and Mariana Islands to observe the American capture of Guam. Irene coaled in Mariveles before departing for Kiaochou on 9 July. While in Kiaochou, Irene conducted crew training. She returned to Manila in November, but remained there only briefly, before she was replaced by Kaiserin Augusta. Irene returned to Germany after 1901; in 1903 she went into drydock at the Imperial Shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization, which was completed by 1905. She was stricken on 17 February 1914 and used as a submarine tender, based in Kiel. In 1916, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven. She remained there until 26 November 1921, when she was sold for scrapping for 909,000Marks. She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to <b>deflate,</b> and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

40|$|Store {{managers}} in retail firms are often offered a performance-based compensation scheme accompanied with a performance target by the headquarters. The headquarters adjusts the performance target based on store managersâ€™ historical performance and therefore generates the ratchet effect. Consequently, store managers may downward manipulate performance, that is, <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation, {{so as to}} weasel out of target growth and smooth performance growth. However, the reputation effect that seeks fame by store managers can restrain <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation. We model a dynamic agency setting in which both the ratchet effect and the reputation effect {{are related to the}} store managerâ€™s compensation scheme, and the store manager has to balance her effort and <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation. Our findings reveal that the ratchet effect and environmental volatility jointly determine the existence of <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation, yet the reputation effect can restrain it with increasing environmental volatility. In addition, <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation is inevitable when environmental volatility is large enough, and explicit incentives may promote <b>deflated</b> performance manipulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of cell proliferation {{needs to be}} coordinated with cell growth and differentiation regulation in multicellular organisms for development to occur properly and tumourogenesis to be avoided. Cell proliferation is regulated through positive and negative signals that influence progression through the cell cycle. The cell cycle is regulated by cyclin dependent kinases that are controlled by the binding of cyclins, whose protein levels oscillate throughout the cell cycle. It is extremely important that progression through the cell cycle is regulated correctly, that mitosis only occurs once DNA replication is completed, and that DNA replication only begins once chromosomes have segregated into daughter cells. While there is great understanding about how the different phases of the cell cycle are controlled, it is still largely unknown how the phases are coordinately regulated, and how the cell cycle is regulated externally during development. An understanding of how cell proliferation is coordinated with cell growth and differentiation requires an examination of how the cell integrates various and sometimes competing signals with the core cell cycle machinery to effect cell proliferation in the right developmental context. This study describes the identification of <b>deflated</b> as a novel cell proliferation regulator. Taking a genetic and cell biological approach, the role that <b>deflated</b> plays in regulating cell proliferation was examined. <b>deflated</b> alleles were generated by P-element mobilisation and P-element induced male recombination. The characterisation of four different alleles and the expression pattern of <b>deflated</b> mRNA suggested a role for <b>deflated</b> in regulating cell proliferation and cell signalling. These findings were further supported by genetic interactions observed between <b>deflated</b> and cell proliferation regulators and cell signalling components. Examination of <b>deflated</b> function in Ras signalling demonstrated that <b>deflated</b> may be a negative regulator of Ras signalling. The findings that DEFLATED::GFP protein localised to nuclei and mitotic spindles in embryos and to the apical surface of wing imaginal discs, further support a role for <b>deflated</b> in cell proliferation and cell signalling. When taken together, these data suggest both a direct and an indirect role for <b>deflated</b> in regulating cell proliferation. It appears that DEFLATED {{may be involved in}} regulating re-replication and thus link DNA synthesis completion with M-phase entry. DEFLATED may also regulate spindle function and formation, possibly by forming a complex with Ran and clathrin, two proteins that are predicted to bind DEFLATED and have roles in spindle function. <b>deflated</b> may also regulate cell proliferation indirectly through involvement in Ras signalling, the Ran pathway, or through endocytosis. While these are many roles to ascribe to DEFLATED it may be able to carry them all or a subset out by functioning as an adaptor protein at the intersection of different cellular pathways. This initial analysis is the first to characterise <b>deflated</b> function in any model system and it is clear that <b>deflated</b> is a novel regulator of cell proliferation. Further elucidation of its function will enable an understanding of how sensing and signalling pathways communicate with one another to ensure that cell proliferation occurs correctly. In particular, the study of <b>deflated</b> will enable further understanding on how Ras signalling regulates cell proliferation and how M-phase and the mitotic spindle are regulated...|$|R
