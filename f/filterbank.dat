25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band <b>filterbank</b> of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{designing}} two-channel PR FIR <b>filterbanks</b> with low system delay is proposed. It {{is based on}} the generalization of the structure previously proposed by Phoong et al. Such structurally PR <b>filterbanks</b> are parameterized by two functions (β(z) and α(z)) that can be chosen as linear-phase FIR or allpass functions to construct FIR/IIR <b>filterbanks</b> with good frequency characteristics. The case of using identical β(z) and α(z) was considered by Phoong et al. with the delay parameter M chosen as 2 N - 1. In this paper, the more general case of using different nonlinear-phase FIR functions for β(z) and α(z) is studied. As the linear-phase constraint is relaxed, the lengths of β(z) and α(z) are no longer restricted by the delay parameters of the <b>filterbanks.</b> Hence, higher stopband attenuation can still be achieved at low system delay. The design of the proposed low-delay <b>filterbanks</b> is formulated as a complex polynomial approximation problem, which can be solved by the Remez exchange algorithm or analytic formula with very low complexity. In addition, the orders and delay parameters can be estimated from the given filter specifications using a simple empirical formula. Therefore, low-delay two-channel PR <b>filterbanks</b> with flexible stopband attenuation and cutoff frequencies can be designed using existing filter design algorithms. The generalization of the present approach to the design of a class of wavelet bases associated with these low-delay <b>filterbanks</b> and its multiplier-less implementation using the sum of powers-of-two coefficients are also studied. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Simulation results from an image coding application also show that these transforms yield improvement in the perceptual quality in the reconstruction images.

In that formulation we first designed "one-dimensional" two-channel <b>filterbanks</b> on bipartite graphs, and then extended them to "multi-dimensional" separable two-channel <b>filterbanks</b> for arbitrary graphs via a bipartite subgraph decomposition. We specifically designed wavelet filters based on the spectral decomposition of the graph, and stated necessary and sufficient conditions for a two-channel graph filter-bank on bipartite graphs to provide aliasing-cancellation, perfect reconstruction and orthogonal set of basis (orthogonality). While, the exact graph-QMF designs satisfy all the above conditions, they are not exactly k-hop localized on the graph.
