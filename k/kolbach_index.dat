5000|$|The {{quality of}} {{starches}} in a grain is variable with {{the strain of}} grain used and its growing conditions. [...] "Modification" [...] refers specifically {{to the extent to}} which starch molecules in the grain consist of simple chains of starch molecules versus branched chains; a fully modified grain contains only simple-chain starch molecules. A grain that is not fully modified requires mashing in multiple steps rather than at simply one temperature as the starches must be de-branched before amylase can work on them. One indicator of the degree of modification of a grain is that grain's Nitrogen ratio; that is, the amount of soluble Nitrogen (or protein) in a grain vs. the total amount of Nitrogen(or protein). This number is also referred to as the [...] "Kolbach Index" [...] and a malt with a <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> between 36% and 42% is considered a malt that is highly modified and suitable for single infusion mashing. Maltsters use the length of the acrospire vs. the length of the grain to determine when the appropriate degree of modification has been reached before drying or kilning.|$|E

40|$|Quality {{of barley}} {{consists}} of precisely defined grain quality attributes (grain weight, grading, grain protein concentration, etc.) and malt quality attributes (extract, viscosity, <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index,</b> etc.). Barley quality attributes are quantitatively inherited and greatly affected by environmental {{factors such as}} temperature, available water, nitrogen fertilizer and soil type. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of genotype and growing conditions (year) on grain and malt quality attributes in barley grown under field conditions in the Pannonian zone. The eight spring two-row barley varieties were studied during a seven growing seasons (1998 - 2004) on the location Novi Sad (45 ° 20 'N, 15 ° 51 'E, 86 m asl). The growing season predominantly affected variation of the all studied grain and malt quality attributes of spring barley where its percentage of variance was 35. 2 %, 20. 2 %, 32. 5 %, 25. 4 %, 30. 9 %, 31. 2 %, and 38. 5 % for grain weight (GW), grading (GRA), grain protein content (GPC), viscosity (VIS), <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> (KOL), Hartong number (HAR) and extract content (EXT), respectively. The interaction of GxE comprised of 28. 4 %, 64. 5 %, 38. 2 %, 54. 0 %, 39. 6 %, 41. 2 % and 23. 7 % of variation for GW, GRA, GPC, VIS, KOL, HAR and EXT, respectively. The genetic component of variance ranged from 11. 1 % for GRA to 35. 0 % for EXT. The heritability was the lowest for GRA- 0. 54 and the highest for EXT- 0. 91. Across growing seasons GW ranged from 39. 6 to 46. 1 g, GRA from 76. 7 to 91. 1 %, GPC from 12. 1 to 13. 5 g 100 - 1 g dm, VIS from 1. 44 till 1. 61 m.

Although growing conditions in the Pannonian zone are less favorable for malting barley production in relation to western Europe it does not exclude malting barley production with acceptable quality in the Pannonian zone environments.

40|$|Published {{version is}} a large file {{containing}} all poster presentations. The proportion and degree of starch, protein and cell wall modification during malting are critical in determining {{the quality of the}} final product. While high levels of cell wall modification are desirable to prevent filtration problems, only partial degradation of protein is required. The relationship between cell wall and protein modification is complex with numerous genes likely to be involved. A number of commonly measured traits give an indication of the level of modification. Free amino nitrogen (FAN), <b>Kolbach</b> <b>Index</b> (KI) and soluble protein (SP) are used as indicators of the level of modification of the proteins, while wort -glucan (WBG) and wort viscosity indicate the level of modification of the cell walls. The Australian National Barley Molecular Marker Program (NBMMP) has investigated these traits using a number of Australian mapping populations. Due to the complex relationship between protein and carbohydrate modification this information will not be useful to barley breeders unless knowledge of how and why these regions are influencing modification is known.

40|$|Malted barley is an {{important}} ingredient used in the brewing and distilling industry worldwide. In this study, we used a proteomics approach to investigate the biochemical function of previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on barley chromosomes 1 H and 4 H that influence malting quality. Using a subset of barley introgression lines containing wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) alleles at these QTLs, we validated that wild barley alleles at the chromosome 1 H QTL reduced overall malting quality, whereas wild barley alleles at the chromosome 4 H QTL improved the malting quality parameters α-amylase activity, VZ 45, and <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> compared to the control genotype Scarlett. 2 DE was used to detect changes in protein expression during the first 72 h of micromalting associated with these QTLs. In total, 16 protein spots showed {{a significant change in}} expression between the introgression lines and Scarlett, of which 14 were successfully identified with MS. Notably, the wild barley alleles in the line containing the chromosome 4 H QTL showed a sixfold increased expression of a limit dextrinase inhibitor. The possible role of the identified proteins in malting quality is discussed. The knowledge gained will assist ongoing research toward cloning the genes underlying these important QTL. Timothy J.

40|$|In this study, {{more than}} 1, 000 {{commercial}} malting samples from Australia and elsewhere, primarily malted in 2005 and 2006, were analyzed for {{their levels of}} the diastatic power (DP) enzymes alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, and limit dextrinase. The survey showed {{that there was more}} variation within a variety for DP and DP enzymes than between varieties. The data were evaluated, and a micromalting experiment was conducted to ascertain whether the wide range of malt qualities observed was the result of customer specifications, environmental conditions under which the barley was grown, variety, or malting practices. The evaluation of malt used by two breweries {{over the course of a}} year suggested that the conventional brewery customer specifications for variety, <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index,</b> and DP are somewhat successful in constraining potential fermentability variation. The conditions under which barley for malting was grown were also plausible factors that could explain the observed differences in DP enzyme levels. However, micromalting barley sourced from different regions showed that malting conditions had a strong influence on the malt levels of alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase. When combined, the observations and conclusions of this study further support our previous recommendations that the routine measurement of individual DP enzymes would most likely improve the consistency and predictability of the potential fermentability of malts supplied to brewers.

40|$|The {{activities}} of barley and malt proteinases have been measured using haemoglobin and the highly degradable barley protein fraction (HDBPF) in malting and feed barley varieties. In conjunction, the barley and malt total protein and its components: hordein, glutelin, soluble proteins and {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) as well as <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> were investigated. The comparative analysis of results revealed that the general grain modification index of Kolbach (KI), which was higher in malting varieties, was much more strongly associated with the levels of hordein degraded during malting than any other parameter investigated. The KI levels were also correlated {{with the increase in}} the levels of FAN, but not with the increase in the levels of soluble protein or changes in the glutelin component. The changes in total proteinase activity were low and cannot account for the increase in KI or the degraded hordein. The levels of total proteinase activity in both feed and malting barley varieties were similar. The results suggest that estimation of the levels of degraded hordein, during malting, is a sensitive indicator of the total proteolytic action of proteinases as well as the degradability of the reserve proteins. Therefore, we recommend measuring the amounts of hordein degraded during malting for the assessment of the impacts of grain protein and proteinases on malting barley quality of different varieties, in addition to KI and FAN. ...|$|E

Many of the resistant accessions are from East Asia, and limited information is available on their genetic diversity and malt quality. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic diversity among 30 East Asian accessions and two North American cultivars. Genetic diversity was based on 49 simple-sequence repeat markers. All accessions were tested for barley grain brightness; protein content; 1, 000 -kernel weight; malting loss; fine-grind malt extract; content of plump kernels, free amino nitrogen, soluble protein, and wort beta-glucan; the <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> (i. e., the ratio of malt soluble protein to malt total protein); a-amylase activity; diastatic power; won color; and wort viscosity. A few accessions had equal quality compared with Harrington and Conlon barley for individual traits but not for all.

A modified European Brewery Convention/American Society Brewing Chemists mashing protocol was used with mash-in temperatures ranging between 45 and 76 °C for full-malt and 30 % rice adjunct mashes. Malt extract yield varied little with mashing temperature for most varieties in this temperature range. However, the fermentability, maltose content, and free amino nitrogen of that extract was considerably affected by mashing temperature with 65 °C achieving the highest fermentability for all malt varieties. Multilinear regression analysis of full-malt and rice adjunct mashing trials at 65 °C using 43 commercial malts showed {{that the level of}} alpha-amylase and total limit dextrinase activity, <b>Kolbach</b> <b>Index,</b> and the total beta-amylase activity level and thermostability were the most important malt quality predictors of wort fermentability. These conclusions suggest that the conventional DP assessment could be replaced with the measurement of its component enzymes outlined above so that maltsters could better satisfy brewers malt quality expectations by blending and defining their malt quality in terms of these fermentability predicting factors. This information would be particularly useful to brewers who brew with multiple varieties and blends from different suppliers.

The following analytical determinations were carried out: total protein content (%), extract yield M. F. i. a. (%), Hartong index VZ (45 °C), viscosity 8. 6 °P (mPa s), boiled wort colour (EBC), soluble nitrogen content (mg/ 100 g), <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> (%), friability (%) and &# 946;-glucan. The descriptive analysis of data was performed and the coefficients of genetic dissimilarity were estimated for each pair. The relative contribution of each trait of genetic diversity was measured and also the correlations among them. According to the genetic dissimilarity matrix, a cluster analysis and scatter chart were constructed. Through cluster analysis, two major similarity groups were observed. The soluble nitrogen was the variable that contributed the most for the genetic variability (86. 6 %), followed by &# 946;-glucan (12. 5 %). The results indicate that the barley grown in the savanna is ready to be included in the national malt process and that there is a genetic variability among the barley genotypes evaluated for the malting quality traits. It can be concluded that the barley can be used in the Brazilian irrigated barley improvement programme. The qualitative traits that contribute the most to the genetic diversity are soluble nitrogen and &# 946;-glucan and the less variable ones are protein content and malt viscosity. 201...|$|E
40|$|There is a need for fast, {{cheap and}} {{sufficient}} accurate methods for prediction of barley grain quality. The determination of Brabender hardness {{seems to be}} promising. The aim of this work was to compare three different methods for evaluation of graphic output from Brabender farinograph and subsequently select the most optimal method for routine laboratory work. 108 samples (twelve cultivars from three localities and three years) were analyzed for grain hardness. Simultaneously selected parameters of grain and malt were determined. The correlations among methods for evaluation were estimated as well as among selected technological traits of barley grain and malt. Grain hardness expressed by area under curve (counted by specific weight of paper ´A´ and measured by planimetr ´B´) showed tendencies to distinguish the varieties by their malting quality. The same trend was not observed for the method C (hardness expressed by maximum value of peak). Nearly perfect positive correlation (0. 99 ***) {{was found between the}} results of method A and method B. Medium correlation was found between values obtained by method A and method C (0. 58 ***).

40|$|Prediction of malt {{fermentability}} (apparent attenuation limit — AAL) by {{measurement of}} the diastatic power enzymes (DPE), α-amylase, total limit dextrinase, total β-amylase, β-amylase thermostability, and the <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index</b> (KI or free amino nitrogen — FAN) is superior to the conventional use of diastatic power (DP) alone. The thermostability of β-amylase {{is known to be}} an important factor in determining fermentability, thus the thermostability of the other relatively thermolabile enzyme, limit dextrinase, was investigated to determine if it was also useful in predicting fermentability. To facilitate this aim, methods were developed for a rapid and cost efficient assay of both β-amylase and limit dextrinase thermostability. Internationally important Australian and international malting varieties were compared for their total limit dextrinase and β-amylase activity and thermostability. Interestingly, the level of limit dextrinase thermostability was observed to be inversely correlated with total limit dextrinase activity. The prediction of malt fermentability was achieved by both forward step-wise multi-linear regression (MLR) and the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate model development methods. Both methods produced similar identifications of the parameters predicting wort fermentability at similar levels of predictive power. Both models were substantially better at predicting fermentability than the traditional use of DP on its own. The emphasis of this study was on the identification of predictive factors that can be consistently used in models to predict fermentability, because the model parameter estimates will subtly vary depending on mashing conditions, yeast strain/fermentation conditions and malt source. The application of these multivariate model development methods (PLS and MLR) enabled the identification of further potential fermentability predicting factors. The analyses divided the predictive parameters into those defined by DP enzymes and those associated with modification (KI, FAN, fine/coarse difference, wort β-glucan and friability). Surprisingly, limit dextrinase thermostability was not a substantial predictor of fermentability, presumably due to its negative correlation with total limit dextrinase activity. The application of these insights in the malting and brewing industries is expected to result in substantial improvements in brewing consistency and enable more specific quality targets for barley breeder's progeny selection cut-off limits to be more precisely defined...|$|E
40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{has a long}} {{tradition}} as a raw material for the production of malt and beer. While breeding and cultivation efforts for barley have been highly successful in creating agronomically and brew- technical optimal specialty cultivars that have become well established as brewing barley varieties, the picture is completely different for brewing wheat. An increasing wheat beer demand results in a rising amount of raw material. Wheat has been - and still is – grown almost exclusively for the baking industry. It is this high demand that defines most of the wheat breeding objectives; and these objectives are generally not favourable in brewing industry. It is of major interest to screen wheat varieties for brewing processability and to give more focus to wheat as a brewing cereal. To obtain fast and reliable predications about the suitability of wheat cultivars a new mathematical method was developed in this work. The method allows a selection based on generally accepted quality characteristics. As selection criteria the parameters raw protein, soluble nitrogen, <b>Kolbach</b> <b>index,</b> extract and viscosity were chosen. During a triannual cultivation series, wheat varieties were evaluated on their suitability for brewing as well as stability to environmental conditions. To gain a fundamental understanding of the complex malting process, microstructural changes were evaluated and visualized by confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, changes observed in the micrographs were verified and endorsed by metabolic changes using established malt attributes. The degradation and formation of proteins during malting is essential for the final beer quality. To visualise fundamental protein changes taking place during malting, samples of each single process step were analysed and fractioned according their solubility. Protein fractions were analysed using a Lab-on-a-chip technique as well as OFFgel analysis. In general, a different protein distribution of wheat compared to barley or oat could be confirmed. During the malting process a degradation of proteins to small peptides and amino acids could be observed in all four Osborn fractions. Furthermore, in this study a protein profiling was performed to evaluate changes during the mashing process as well as the influence of grist composition. Differences in specific protein peaks and profile were detected for all samples during mashing. This study investigated the suitability of wheat for malting and brewing industry and closed the scientifical gap of amylolytic, cytolytic and proteolytic changes during malting and mashing...|$|E
