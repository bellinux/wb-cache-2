5|$|Without medical intervention, {{the male}} {{fertility}} rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> available medical interventions, {{fewer than half}} of men with SCI can father children. Assisted insemination is usually required. As with erection, therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the success, {{or because}} of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E

"Upon my honour, your ladyship is too severe," [...] said Lord Etherington; [...] "you {{surround}} yourself every <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that is {{clever and}} accomplished {{among the people}} here, and then you ridicule a poor secluded monster, who dare not approach your charmed circle, because he seeks for some amusement elsewhere.

60|$|PARLIAMENT assembled, {{the town}} filled, and every {{moment in the}} day of the Duke of St. James was occupied. Sir Carte and his tribe filled up the morning.

Then came the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> its crash and glare; the banquet, the opera, and the ball.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} weapons used by open shops to combat radical forces was “decausualization,” which relied heavily on the use of company-controlled hiring halls to weed out as many union sympathizers as possible from working in the docks. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the preventative measures put in place, members of the IWW were able to still infiltrate a vast amount of the docks on the West Coast under the guise of other organizations used as a front.|$|E

St. Columba had a prophecy of a [...] "certain holy and {{excellent}} man, who will arrive here among us before evening." [...] According to Adamnan, God provided Cainnech with a safe and calm crossing, even though the sea was perilous and stormy that day. St. Columba received him that <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> honour and hospitality.|$|R

25|$|From Voskhod to the International Space Station, {{spacecraft}} {{have improved}} {{in size and}} comfort and have allowed {{more and more people}} traveling into orbit. However, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the human spaceflight experience gained over the past fifty years, no single completely effective countermeasure, or combination of countermeasures, exists against the negative effects of long-duration exposure to weightlessness. If a crew of astronauts were to embark on a six-month journey to Mars today, the countermeasures currently employed would presumably leave them less operational after landing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the {{precautions}} taken by medical professionals, infection reportedly occurs {{in up to}} 13.9% of patients after stabilization of an open fracture, and in about 0.5-2% of patients who receive joint prostheses. In order to reduce these numbers, the surfaces of the devices used in these procedures have been altered in hopes to prevent {{the growth of the}} bacteria that leads to these infections. This has been achieved by coating titanium devices with an antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. This antiseptic combination successfully prevents the growth of the five main organisms that cause medical related infections, which include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.|$|E
25|$|Colonel William C. Gorgas {{had been}} {{appointed}} chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly yellow fever and malaria which had recently {{been shown to be}} mosquito-borne following the work of Dr. Carlos Finlay and Dr. Walter Reed. There was investment in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the Commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated. Nevertheless, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this effort, about 5,600 workers died of disease and accidents during the U.S. construction phase of the canal.|$|E

500|$|One more {{proposal}} which utilizes {{the high}} nuclear fission rate of 242mAm is a nuclear battery.

A single 3.2kg 242mAm charge of such battery could provide about 140kW of power over a period of 80 days. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the potential benefits, the current applications of 242mAm are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this particular nuclear isomer.|$|E

500|$|Loss {{of habitat}} because of {{agriculture}} has {{also contributed to}} its decline, though {{this is no longer}} as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the conservation efforts, the prospects for their survival are grim. Because the population is restricted to one small area, they are very susceptible to disease and [...] inbreeding depression. Conservation geneticists estimate a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve the genetic diversity of this conservation-reliant species.|$|E
