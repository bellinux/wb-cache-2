50|$|A {{microstrip}} circuit uses a thin <b>flat</b> <b>conductor</b> {{which is}} parallel to a ground plane. Microstrip {{can be made by}} having a strip of copper on one side of a printed circuit board (PCB) or ceramic substrate while the other side is a continuous ground plane. The width of the strip, the thickness of the insulating layer (PCB or ceramic) and the dielectric constant of the insulating layer determine the characteristic impedance. Microstrip is an open structure whereas coaxial cable is a closed structure.|$|E
5000|$|Stripline is a <b>flat</b> <b>conductor</b> with {{a ground}} plane both {{above and below}} the conductor. The variant of {{stripline}} where the space between the two ground planes is completey filled with a dielectric material is sometimes known as triplate. Stripline can be manufactured by etching the transmission line pattern on to a printed circuit board. The bottom of this board is left completely covered in copper and forms the bottom ground plane. A second board is clamped on top of the first. This second board has no pattern on the bottom and plain copper on the top to form the top ground plane. A sheet of copper foil may be wrapped around the two boards to electrically bond the two ground planes firmly together. On the other hand, stripline for high power applications such as radar will more likely be made as solid metal strips with periodic dielectric supports, essentially air dielectric.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, one of {{the early}} {{implementations}} of mutual capacitance touchscreen technology was developed at CERN based on their capacitance touch screens developed in 1972 by Danish electronics engineer Bent Stumpe. This technology was used to develop a new type of human machine interface (HMI) for the control room of the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator. In a handwritten note dated 11 March 1972, Stumpe presented his proposed solution - a capacitive touch screen with a fixed number of programmable buttons presented on a display. The screen was to consist of a set of capacitors etched into a film of copper on a sheet of glass, each capacitor being constructed so that a nearby <b>flat</b> <b>conductor,</b> such as the surface of a finger, would increase the capacitance by a significant amount. The capacitors were to consist of fine lines etched in copper on a sheet of glass - fine enough (80 μm) and sufficiently far apart (80 μm) to be invisible (CERN Courier April 1974 p117). In the final device, a simple lacquer coating prevented the fingers from actually touching the capacitors. In 1976, MIT described a keyboard with variable graphics capable of multi-touch detection, for what is very likely to be the very first multitouch screen.|$|E

50|$|Patents issued at {{the turn}} of the 20th century show that early {{researchers}} were envisioning ways of making <b>flat</b> <b>conductors</b> sandwiched between layers of insulating material to layout electrical circuits to serve in early telephony switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of <b>flat</b> metal <b>conductors</b> on paraffin coated paper. Thomas Edison’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns cellulose gum applied to linen paper with graphite powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.|$|R

50|$|Planar format {{transmission}} lines are <b>flat</b> <b>conductors</b> manufactured {{by a number}} of techniques on to a substrate. They are nearly always an unbalanced format. At the low transmission speeds of early telegraph it was only necessary to consider transmission line theory for a circuit design when the transmission was over many miles. Similarly, the audio frequencies used by telephones are relatively low and transmission line theory only becomes significant for distances of at least between buildings. However, at the higher radio frequencies and microwave frequencies transmission line considerations can become important inside a device, just a matter of centimetres. At the very high data rates handled by modern computer processors, transmission line considerations can even be important inside an individual integrated circuit. Planar technologies were developed for these kinds of small size applications and are not very appropriate for long distance transmissions.|$|R

40|$|The {{normal and}} the lateral Casimir {{interactions}} between corrugated ideal metallic plates {{in the presence}} of an amplifying or an absorptive dielectric slab has been studied by the path-integral quantization technique. The effect of the amplifying slab, which is located between corrugated conductors, is to increase the normal and lateral Casimir interactions, while the presence of the absorptive slab diminishes the interactions. These effects are more pronounced if the thickness of the slab increases, and also if the slab comes closer to one of the bounding conductors. When both bounding ideal <b>conductors</b> are <b>flat,</b> the normal Casimir force is non-monotonic {{in the presence of}} the amplifying slab and the system has a stable mechanical equilibrium state, while the force is attractive and is weakened by intervening the absorptive dielectric slab in the cavity. By replacing one of the <b>flat</b> <b>conductors</b> by a <b>flat</b> ideal permeable plate the force becomes non-monotonic and the system has an unstable mechanical equilibrium state in the presence of either an amplifying or an absorptive slab. When the left side plate is conductor and the right one is permeable, the force is non-monotonic in the presence of a double-layer DA (dissipative-amplifying) dielectric slab with a stable mechanical equilibrium state, while it is purely repulsive in the presence of a double-layer AD (amplifying-dissipative) dielectric slab.

40|$|Fast current pulses manage lasers and {{particle}} accelerators and require sophisticate systems to be detected. At today Rogowski coils are well known. They are {{designed and built}} with a toroidal structure. In recently application, flat transmission lines are imploded {{and for this reason}} we develop a linear Rogowski coil to detect current pulses inside <b>flat</b> <b>conductors.</b> To get deep information from the system, it was approached by means of the theory of the transmission lines. The coil we build presents a resistance but it doesn’t influence the rise time of the response, instead the integrating time. We also studied the influence of the magnetic properties of coil support. The new device was able to record pulses of more hundred nanoseconds depending on the inductance, load impedance and resistance of the coil. Furthermore, its response was characterized by a sub-nanosecond rise time (~ 100 ps), The attenuation coefficient depends mainly on the turn number of the coil, while the quality of the response depends both on the manufacture quality of the coil and on the magnetic core characteristics. In biophysical applications often, a double line is employed {{in order to have a}} sample as control and a sample stressed by a light source.
