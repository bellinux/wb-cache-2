2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran goaded assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told <b>Judge</b> <b>Lance</b> <b>Ito</b> of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E
