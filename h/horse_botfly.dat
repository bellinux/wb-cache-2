5000|$|Gasterophilus is a genus of {{parasitic}} {{flies in}} the family Oestridae which includes the <b>horse</b> <b>botfly.</b> They lay eggs on horses, caribou, donkeys, and similar animals, usually equines. The eggs are laid depending on the species of gasterophilus. There are two species - Gasterophilus nasalis, and gasterophilus intestinalis. Nasalis lay eggs around the mouth, eyes, nose, and chin. Intestinalis lay eggs around the lower legs, and shoulders. The eggs hatch by licking, moisture or humidity. The gasterophilus intestinalis then travel to the mouth where larvae are hatched and travel into the intestines. The gasterophilus nasalis travel to the sinus cavities and/or the brain. Gasterophilus is laid by the bot fly {{which looks like a}} bumble bee, which hovers around the ground. These can be managed and held down to a lower number by a de-worming schedule and removing the eggs with a bot comb or a grooming block. Intestinal bots in large numbers can cause gastrointestinal problems with animals. [...] There are exceptional cases of human babies infected by these flies.|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Respiratory {{proteins}} {{enhance the}} capacity of the blood for oxygen transport and support intracellular storage and delivery of oxygen. Hemocyanin and hemoglobin are the respiratory proteins that occur in the Pancrustacea. The copper-containing hemocyanins evolved from phenoloxidases in the stem lineage of arthropods. For a long time, he-mocyanins had only been known from the malacostracan crustaceans but recent studies identified hemocyanin also in Remipedia, Ostracoda, and Branchiura. Hemoglobins are common in the Branchiopoda but have also been sporadically found in other crustacean classes (Malacostraca, Copepoda, Thecostraca). Respiratory proteins had long been considered unnecessary in the hexapods because of the tracheal system. Only chironomids, some backswimmers, and the <b>horse</b> <b>botfly,</b> which all live under hypoxic conditions, were known exceptions and possess hemoglobins. However, recent data suggest that hemocyanins occur in most ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects. Phylogenetic analysis showed the hemocyanins of insects and Remipedia to be similar, suggesting a close relationship of these taxa. Hemocyanin has been lost in dragonflies, mayflies, and Eumetabola (HemipteraÃ¾Holometabola). In cockroaches and grasshoppers, hemocy-anin expression is restricted to the developing embryo while in adults oxygen is supplied solely by the tracheal system. This pattern suggests that hemocyanin was the oxygen-transport protein in the hemolymph of the last common ancestor of the pancrustaceans. The loss was probably associated with miniaturization, a period of restricted availability of oxygen, a change in life-style, or morphological changes. Once lost, hemocyanin was not regained. Some pancrustaceans also possess cellular globin genes with uncertain functions, which are expressed at low levels. When a respiratory protein was again required, hemoglobins evolved several times independently from cellular globins...|$|E
40|$|Larvae of Rhinoestrus spp. (Diptera, Oestridae) infect nasal and sinus {{cavities}} of horses, {{causing a}} nasal myiasis characterized by severe respiratory distress. Presently, {{the diagnosis of}} <b>horse</b> nasal <b>botfly</b> relies on the observation of clinical signs, on the post mortem retrieval of larvae or on molecular assays performed using pharyngeal swabs. The present study was carried out to characterize larval somatic proteins and salivary glands of Rhinoestrus spp. in a preliminary assessment towards the immunodiagnosis of equine rhinoestrosis. Out of the 212 necropsied horses 13 were positive {{for the presence of}} Rhinoestrus spp. larvae. The analysis of the sera from the infected animals by Western blotting assay showed the presence of a specific host humoral immune response against Rhinoestrus spp. larvae and proved that the salivary glands are the major immunogens in horse nasal botflie...|$|R
