2500|$|The {{last known}} {{survivor}} of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985. Simkins wrote in The Guardian in 2001: [...] "I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. 'That was true. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'" [...] Peter Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was {{as large as a}} medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E

[...] For some time, he was too traumatized to speak about his experiences. His wife told his grandson Obama: [...] "From that day on, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was now an old man." [...] Onyango was permanently scarred, suffering pain and requiring assistance in moving until his death. Although previously he had worked closely with British colonists, Onyango became bitterly anti-British after his abuse. According to his third wife, Sarah, Onyango had converted from tribal religion to Catholicism early in life. When he later converted to Islam, he took the first name Hussein. She said that he passed on the name of Hussein to his children, but not the religion. Onyango is {{sometimes referred to as}} Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama. The word mzee (meaning [...] "elder") is a Kenyan honorific.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused a}} minute, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> what <b>he</b> {{had to tell}} me {{was very hard to}} say.|$|R
60|$|This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me. He {{had been}} at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and <b>I</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was inky.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} say that I {{thoroughly}} appreciated the practical purpose which <b>I</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had in view, and that {{the first of the}} two alternatives was the alternative I chose.|$|R
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was taking}} several bank-notes {{out of the}} pocket-book, and stopped him.|$|E
60|$|He {{bellowed}} rollickingly. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was in the}} pink. As {{a matter}} of fact, I had noticed something of the sort directly I met him, but had attributed it to alcoholic stimulant.|$|R
60|$|Moses laughed, and as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> both <b>he</b> and his new-found {{mother were}} in a fit state to be left together, and that the sun now wanted but {{an hour or two}} of setting, I rose to take my leave.|$|R
6000|$|Jerry {{had much}} the same {{struggle}} in his mind as I, but, watching his face, <b>I</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ready to act upon Bill Jepson's suggestion, and without {{waiting for him to}} give his thoughts words, I said: ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the twist}} {{of his mouth}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was only deferring a smile.|$|E
60|$|I did wish. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{expected}} me to say No--so I said it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had learned}} his lesson, and so {{said no more}} on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] said he, rising unabashed. [...] "I {{can always}} trust my instinct. I knew the moment <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a {{cavalier}} worth letting blood. Now, sir, your sword and harness, and I am {{at your service}} outside!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{appeal to}} my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> go <b>he</b> would not. So I {{made up my}} mind to let him stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the {{afternoon}} he had to do with my less important papers.|$|R
6000|$|To learn whether I {{really had}} been was, <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> {{what he would}} most have liked; but <b>I</b> also <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had, as to this, a scruple about asking me. What <b>I</b> most <b>saw,</b> however, was <b>that</b> to tell him I should have to understand. [...] "What scent do you allude to?" ...|$|R
60|$|Softly I {{moved across}} the room towards him and then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was asleep.|$|E
60|$|Maputa and I drew aside, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{wished to}} speak with me alone.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not know}} what I meant. I explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "He started. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not {{expected}} so much as half the sum I had mentioned. It is needless to add that his tongue lied, while his face spoke the truth, and <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> replied to me the answer was, 'Nothing like enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{was angry}} at all this, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> then <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was making fun of me; and I said no more to him, for {{he was not in}} the right frame of mind to listen to me. But I did not stop thinking.|$|R
60|$|When we drew near, {{from out}} of the group of nobles {{advanced}} one man. <b>I</b> looked and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Kari, yes, the Inca himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did {{not believe}} in my powers, and became all the more {{determined}} to succeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> liked you, my dear. Men {{under such}} {{circumstances}} have different ways of showing their liking." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{his face}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have denied it had it lain within {{his power to}} utter a {{deliberate}} falsehood.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> also <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looked {{this way}} and that way, as if he would run; yet he stood still, because (as I perceived) he could not tell which way to go. I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist coming to him, who asked, [...] "Wherefore dost thou cry?" ...|$|R
60|$|As for {{the third}} man, I took no pains to study him, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was nothing but an interpreter.|$|R
5000|$|... “When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> sign,” <b>he</b> later wrote, “I was {{stricken}} just {{as surely}} as Paul on the Damascus Road. Here was the source of my family wealth, and it was producing untold human misery before my own eyes. Then and there I pledged to God that not another penny of that money should come to me.” ...|$|R
60|$|I did not reply. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{meant what}} he said, and I was {{busy trying to}} think how to defend myself.|$|E
60|$|He {{listened with}} an unmoved face, nodding his white lock at {{intervals}} as the narrative went on. But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was disturbed by it.|$|E
60|$|Boom {{went the}} great gun {{for the second}} time. Hassan said nothing, but his jaw dropped, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lost exactly three teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it has pleased the Lord that dear Stephen should die," [...] said Mrs. Strong in {{her quiet}} voice. [...] "When you {{have spoken to}} the people out there, doctor, will you take me home? I am very sorry to trouble, but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> after <b>he</b> was gone Stephen wished me to turn to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 303. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{therefore}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>that</b> hath gifts, had need be let into a {{sight of}} the nature of them, to wit, that they come short of making of him to be in a truly saved condition, lest he rest in them, and so fall short of the grace of God.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> also <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looked {{this way}} and that way, as if he would run; yet he stood still, because, as I perceived, he could not tell which way to go.[6] I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist coming to him, who asked, [...] "Where fore dost thou cry?" ...|$|R
