In {{order to}} achieve a good <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> stability, {{emission}} and economic effect for spark ignition engine, the air-fuel ratio has to been controlled under idle conditions. In this paper, an engine model for a 125 cc EFI motorcycle engine was established using the GT-power software, and a simulation and experimental study was performed when engine under <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> condition.

The basic concept of engine <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> and the requirements and strategies of <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control were introduced, and the features and structures of CAN bus technology were analyzed. An <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control system of automobile engine based on CAN bus was designed which included main control module, front control module and rear control module. The overall structure, hardware design and software implementation of the system were given. The system can realize the desired functions, and it has certain application value...|$|R
50|$|The {{centrifugal}} clutch disengages the chain {{from the engine}} when the engine is only at <b>idling</b> <b>speed,</b> engaging the drive automatically when the throttle is squeezed and the engine is at full speed. The purpose of this clutch is to avoid having a moving chain when the saw is idling and temporarily not cutting. At idle the chain should not move.|$|E
50|$|SU {{carburettors}} do {{not have}} a conventional choke flap, which in a fixed-jet carburettor enriches the mixture for starting the engine from cold by restricting the air supply upstream of the venturi. Instead a mechanism lowers the jet assembly, which has the same effect as the needle rising in normal operation - namely increasing the supply of fuel so that the carburettor will now deliver an enriched mixture at all engine speeds and throttle positions. The 'choke' mechanism on an SU carburettor usually also incorporates a system for holding the throttle plate slightly open to raise the engine's <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and prevent stalling at low speeds due to the rich mixture.|$|E
5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> {{stabilisation}} {{is enhanced}} by {{a process known as}} <b>Idle</b> <b>Speed</b> Control (ISC). This function (previously known as Digital Idle Stabilization), allows the ECM to modify ignition timing at idle to further improve idle quality.|$|R

Automobile idle adjuster controls <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> by controlling the mode of throttle valve channel. It also can increase <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> automatically when the engine load is bigger. This can be happen when the air-conditioning unit, power steering or torque converter is introduced. In this paper, we mainly studied the effect, structure, working principle about step motor mode fro automobile idle adjuster. We also introduced the improvement about traditional automobile idle adjuster...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> (<b>idling,</b> or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways engine idle and vehicle <b>idle.</b> At <b>idle</b> <b>speed,</b> the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car engine, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|In typical {{combustion}} engines found in vehicles, the torque is low at <b>idling</b> <b>speed,</b> reaches a maximal value between 1,500 and 6,500 RPM, and then falls {{more or less}} sharply toward the redline. Below the RPM of maximal torque, the compression is not ideal. Above this speed several factors start to limit the torque, such as growing friction, the required time for closing the valves and combustion, and insufficient intake flow. Due to increasing vibration and heat, an external RPM limitation may also be installed. Power {{is the product of}} torque multiplied by speed of rotation (analogous to force times speed), so peak power is produced in the upper speed range where there's both high torque and high RPM.|$|E
5000|$|Farms {{up until}} then had little machinery, {{electricity}} was still uncommon, and the tractor {{was expected to be}} able also to power farm machinery. For this purpose, the tractor was equipped with a power take-off shaft at the rear. This could drive either a hitched implement such as a rotovator, or static machinery such as a thresher. The engine was fitted with a governor to allow the engine speed to be set somewhere between <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> of 400 rpm and full power speed of 2,200 rpm, maintaining this speed against varying loads. The [...] "belt hp" [...] rating of the tractor was 23.9 hp although the tax rating of 20 hp gave the tractor its model number of TE20.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} he encountered with the Great Yarmouth MR9s was, {{that in order for}} the automatic bypass vacuum generator to provide sufficient vacuum for braking assistance <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> had to be kept low, this resulted in an engine straining at its mountings. Eventually failure of the mountings happened on one of them but not before another managed to shed its dynamo whilst in service, others had sheared a number of chassis brackets. He also found the gearchange linkage (although it kept the engine in place when the mountings failed) developed far too much free play and in order to select reverse on one he had to open the half-door on the passenger side of the cab. Others managed to grind to a halt when two gears were selected simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control {{built into the}} ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. <b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|R

5000|$|In {{more common}} applications, a modern, well {{designed}} and engineered fuel-injected, computer-controlled, multi-valve and optionally variable-valve timing-equipped gasoline engine using good fuel can achieve remarkable flexibility in automobile applications, with sufficient torque even at low engine speeds and a relatively flat power output from 1,500 to 6,500 RPM, allowing easy cruising and forgiving low-speed behaviour. However, achieving maximum power for strong acceleration or high road speed still requires high RPM. Though the literal power band covers {{most of the}} operating RPM range, particularly in first gear (as there is no lower gear to shift down to, and no [...] "flat spot" [...] in which the engine does not produce any power), the effective band changes in each gear, becoming the range limited at the upper end by either the limiter, or a point roughly located between peak power and the redline where power drops off, and {{at the lower end}} the engine's <b>idling</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{controls}} in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except {{the windshield wipers}} in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever {{on the floor with}} a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted {{in the middle of the}} steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{performance}} and transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is an important objective for automotive manufacturers, since stringent criteria for exhaust emissions must be met. In particular, (cold) starting is of exceptional importance owing to its {{significant contribution to the}} overall emissions during a transient test cycle. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted on a turbocharged and after-cooled bus-truck diesel engine in order to investigate the engine operating behaviour and the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide, smoke, and combustion noise during cold, warm, and hot starting. With this as a target, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analysers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions and various key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test pattern included a variety of starting conditions, defined by the thermal status of the engine (i. e. the coolant temperature) and its <b>idling</b> <b>speed.</b> As expected, turbocharger lag was found to be the major contributor for the pollutant emissions spikes in all cases, with the thermal status of the engine and its <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> playing important roles in the combustion (in) stability, turbocharger response, and noise radiation...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to idle their engine to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This idling of the engine has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Idling emissions can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, <b>idling</b> <b>speed,</b> etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce engine idling and improve air quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct fire heaters. A direct fire heater reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %. Furthermore, these technologies increase air quality significantly by reducing idling emissions, which is the reason why they are considered as key alternatives to engine idling.
