5|$|John von Neumann's work on {{functional}} analysis and topology in broke new ground {{in mathematics and}} economic theory. It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of <b>differential</b> <b>calculus.</b> In particular, general equilibrium theorists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than <b>differential</b> <b>calculus,</b> because the approach of <b>differential</b> <b>calculus</b> had failed to establish {{the existence of an}} equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{continuing}} turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 {{to take up}} a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for twenty-five years in Berlin, where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: The Introductio in analysin infinitorum, a text on functions published in 1748, and the Institutiones calculi differentialis, published in 1755 on <b>differential</b> <b>calculus.</b> In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E

5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional <b>differential</b> <b>calculus,</b> for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, Hervé Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional <b>differential</b> <b>calculus,</b> because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E

25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration.

They could find {{a solution to the problem}} of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of <b>differential</b> <b>calculus</b> which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using <b>differential</b> <b>calculus.</b>|$|E
