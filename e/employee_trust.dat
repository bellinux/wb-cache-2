2500|$|The {{relationship}} between trust and organizational justice perceptions {{is based on}} reciprocity. Trust in the organization is built from the employee's belief that since current organizational decisions are fair, future organizational decisions will be fair. The continuance of <b>employee</b> <b>trust</b> in the organization and the organization continuing to meet the employee's expectations of fairness creates the reciprocal {{relationship between}} trust and organizational justice (DeConick, 2010). [...] Research has found that procedural justice is the strongest predictor of organizational trust (Hubbell & Chory-Assad, 2005; Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] A positive relationship between an employee and supervisor can lead to trust in the organization (Karriker & Williams, 2009).|$|E

By establishing six nested models and two non-nested models and comparing them with the hypotheses model, we find that an <b>employee’s</b> <b>trust</b> in his/her immediate superior, co-workers, and the top manager all exert positive influences upon his/her work performance and these influences are independent and supplementary to one another. We also discuss the complex effects of an individual’s perception of different organizational members upon their behaviors. It is found that the influence of an <b>employee’s</b> <b>trust</b> in top manager upon individuals’ job performance is partially mediated by his/her trust in immediate superiors.|$|R

Therefore, this paper examines the impact of employee attitudes toward organizational change on <b>employees</b> <b>trust,</b> job satisfaction and job commitment. Research was conducted on Qatari public sector organizations. This study {{may be the first}} inclusive empirical research to analyze the attitudes of employee at public organizations following organizational change. This study evaluates the links between the independent variable (attitude towards organizational change) and three dependent variables – <b>employees</b> <b>trust,</b> job satisfaction and job commitments. The primary data were collected using a questionnaire. Out of the 208 questionnaire that were distributed, 108 were deemed acceptable, a response rate of 52 %. The questionnaire examined the correlation between the independent variable and the three independent variables. In addition, the study employed several control variables, such as age, gender, experience, education, company size and position. The findings support the three hypotheses wherein the independent variable has a positive relationship with the three dependent variables; trust, satisfaction and commitment...|$|R

5000|$|SAS was {{prepared}} to offer £110 million for 26% of the British Caledonian Group's stock, valuing the entire group at £400 million. Jan Carlzon, the then chairman of the SAS group, was well aware that so-called [...] "nationality clauses" [...] in most bilateral air services agreements and most countries' legal framework regulating the ownership of their airlines would restrict SAS's direct involvement in BCal's finances to acquiring a minority stake in its holding company. SAS therefore dispatched a team of executives headed by Jan Carlzon to the UK to work out details of a joint bid. This envisaged setting up an <b>employee</b> <b>trust</b> fund that would hold the same percentage of British Caledonian Group stock {{on behalf of the}} group's employees as SAS itself was seeking to acquire, so as to be compliant with any rules limiting the stakes foreign individuals or entities could own in a British airline. They were prepared to extend a loan to the trustees of the envisaged <b>employee</b> <b>trust</b> fund to enable them to acquire an equal number of shares on the employees' behalf. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank that worked on SAS's bid for 26% of the British Caledonian Group's common stock, proposed this to be structured as a so-called [...] "exploding share". This would have enabled SAS to increase its holding in British Caledonian Group plc to a maximum of 40% through subsequent acquisition of additional non-voting shares. These in turn would have become ordinary shares following greater market liberalisation. The SAS executives discussed these ideas with BCal's senior management and the unions representing its staff at the British Caledonian Group's Crawley headquarters as well as with Government officials in London.|$|E
