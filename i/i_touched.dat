500|$|On 31 December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Pratchett was to be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it <b>I</b> <b>touched,</b> handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

2500|$|Persons {{of royal}} blood {{were thought to}} have the [...] "God given" [...] power of healing this {{condition}} by touch, and sovereigns of England and France practised this power to cure sufferers of scrofula, meaning [...] "Swine Evil", as it was common in pigs, a form of tuberculosis of the bones and lymph nodes, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "King's or Queen's Evil" [...] or [...] "Morbus Regius". In France it was called the Mal De Roi. William the Lion, King of Scotland is recorded in 1206 as curing a case of scrofula by his touching and blessing a child who had the ailment. Charles <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> around 100 people shortly after his coronation at Holyrood in 1630. Rarely fatal, the disease was naturally given to spontaneously cure itself after lengthy periods of remission. Many miraculous cures were recorded, and failures were put down to a lack of faith in the sufferer. The original Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church contained this ceremony. The divine power of kings was believed to be descended from Edward the Confessor, who, according to some legends, received it from Saint Remigius.|$|E
