5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of John combined with an approaching cold front to produce moderate amounts of rainfall across the southwest United States, including a total of 8inches (200mm) in Whitharral and more than 3inches (75mm) in <b>El</b> <b>Paso,</b> Texas. The rainfall flooded many roads in southwestern Texas, including a ½mile (800m) portion of Interstate 10 in <b>El</b> <b>Paso.</b> A slick runway at <b>El</b> <b>Paso</b> International Airport delayed a Continental Airlines jet when its tires were stuck in mud. Rainfall from John in <b>El</b> <b>Paso,</b> combined with an unusually wet year, resulted in twice the normal annual rainfall, and caused 2006 to be the ninth wettest year on record by September. Damage totaled about $100,000 (2006USD) in the <b>El</b> <b>Paso</b> area from the precipitation. In northern Texas, the rainfall alleviated a severe drought, caused the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River to swell and Lake Alan Henry to overflow. The Texas Department of Transportation closed numerous roads due to flooding from the precipitation, including a portion of U.S. Route 385 near Levelland. Several other roads were washed out.|$|E
