Rowlands left after the first series for Life on Mars. Compared to the {{original}} series {{the role of the}} script editors was significantly diminished, with the head writer taking most of those responsibilities. Unlike the original series {{they do not have the}} power to commission scripts. Instead, they act as liaisons between the production staff and the screenwriter, before passing their joint work to the head writer for a [...] "final polish". Raynor said that the <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a creative one, [...] "you are a part of it, but you aren't driving it." ...|$|E
500|$|The bar employs {{six women}} {{part-time}} to wear mermaid costumes and {{swim in the}} pool five evenings a week. They are local women {{from all walks of}} life. [...] The [...] "mermaids" [...] explain that it is fairly easy to stay afloat while wearing a mermaid tail, but the difficult part of the <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> floating; staying underwater as much as possible is necessary in order for patrons to see them through the window. [...] Because they cannot use their legs in a traditional manner, they must work harder with their arms to swim. [...] Mermen also swim in the pool. [...] They were hired early on, but fell out of favor by about 2004. [...] In 2016, they were brought back by popular demand, primarily working during the bar's Tuesday ladies' night.|$|E

Romney went on to say: [...] "And so my <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." [...] After facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments, he at first characterized them as [...] "inelegantly stated", then {{a couple of weeks}} later commented: [...] "I said something that's just completely wrong." [...] Exit polls published following the election showed that voters never saw Romney as someone who cared about people like them.|$|E

What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray".

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head".

In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore."

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} issues of {{legality}} in some countries and states and of sometime opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. The introduction to [...] by Richard Allsop includes the following in the foreword by Professor Stephen Glaister, Director of the RAC (Royal Automobile Club). [...] "While this report fully lays out the background {{to the introduction of}} speed cameras and the need for speed limits, its <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to justify why the national limits are what they are; a review of speed limits to see whether they are soundly based is for another day. What it has done is to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – those who say that what little money there is can be better spent. This report begs to differ. The devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle." ...|$|E
