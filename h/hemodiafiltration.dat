50|$|There {{are three}} primary and two {{secondary}} types of dialysis: hemodialysis (primary), peritoneal dialysis (primary), hemofiltration (primary), <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (secondary), and intestinal dialysis (secondary).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemodiafiltration</b> is a {{combination}} of hemodialysis and hemofiltration, thus used to purify the blood from toxics when the kidney is not working normally and also used to treat acute kidney injury(AKI).|$|E
50|$|There is {{controversy}} about whether intermittent on-line <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (IHDF) gives better results than hemodialysis in an outpatient setting. In Europe, several observational studies have compared outcomes in patients getting dialysis with those getting IHDF.|$|E
5000|$|Hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and <b>hemodiafiltration</b> can be {{continuous}} or intermittent and can use an arteriovenous route (in which blood {{leaves from}} an artery and returns via a vein) or a venovenous route (in which blood leaves from a vein and returns via a vein). This results in various types of RRT, as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Hemoperfusion or haemoperfusion (see {{spelling}} differences) is {{a method}} of filtering the blood extracorporeally (that is, outside the body) to remove a toxin. As with other extracorporeal methods, such as hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemofiltration (HF), and <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (HDF), the blood travels from the patient into a machine, gets filtered, and then travels back into the patient, typically by venovenous access (out of a vein and back into a vein).|$|E
50|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy (RRT) is therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering {{function of the}} kidneys. It is used when the kidneys are not working well, which is called renal failure and includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Renal {{replacement therapy}} includes dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), hemofiltration, and <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> which are various ways of filtration of blood with or without machine. Renal replacement therapy also includes kidney transplantation, which is the ultimate form of replacement in that the old kidney {{is replaced by a}} donor kidney.|$|E
50|$|Hemofiltration is {{sometimes}} used {{in combination with}} hemodialysis, when it is termed <b>hemodiafiltration.</b> Blood is pumped through the blood compartment of a high flux dialyzer, and {{a high rate of}} ultrafiltration is used, so there is a high rate of movement of water and solutes from blood to dialysate that must be replaced by substitution fluid that is infused directly into the blood line. However, dialysis solution is also run through the dialysate compartment of the dialyzer. The combination is theoretically useful because it results in good removal of both large and small molecular weight solutes.|$|E
50|$|Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF) is an {{artificial}} method which approximately mimics the ultrafiltration {{function of the}} kidneys. SCUF is a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) generally used to remove fluid from fluid overloaded patients suffering acute renal failure. During SCUF blood {{is removed from the}} body and is passed through an extracorporeal circuit through a hemofilter and a predetermined percentage of plasma water is removed based upon a prescription. Typically, no more than 2 liters an hour of fluid is removed. The remaining blood is returned to the patient. Unlike hemodialysis, hemofiltration and <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> no dialysate or replacement fluids are used in SCUF.|$|E
50|$|Either {{of these}} {{treatments}} {{can be given}} in outpatient dialysis units, three or more times a week, usually 3-5 hours per treatment. IHDF is used almost exclusively, {{with only a few}} centers using IHF. With both IHF or IHDF, the substitution fluid is prepared on-line from dialysis solution by running dialysis solution through a set of two membranes to purify it before infusing it directly into the blood line. In the United States, regulatory agencies have not yet approved on-line creation of substitution fluid because of concerns about its purity. For this reason, <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> had historically never been used in an outpatient setting in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Continuous {{hemofiltration}} {{was first}} {{described in a}} 1977 paper by Kramer et al. {{as a treatment for}} fluid overload. Hemofiltration is most commonly used in an intensive care unit setting, where it is either given as 8- to 12-hour treatments, so called SLEF (slow extended hemofiltration), or as CHF (continuous hemofiltration), also sometimes called continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). <b>Hemodiafiltration</b> (SLED-F or CHDF or CVVHDF) also is widely used in this fashion. In the United States, the substitution fluid used in CHF or CHDF is commercially prepared, prepackaged, and sterile (or sometimes is prepared in the local hospital pharmacy), avoiding regulatory issues of on-line creation of replacement fluid from dialysis solution.|$|E
50|$|MARS {{treatment}} lowers serum urea and creatinine levels {{improving their}} clearance, and even favors resolution of hepatorenal syndrome. Results are confirmed in a randomized controlled trial published by Mitzner et al. in which 13 patients diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type I {{were treated with}} MARS therapy. Mean survival was 25,2±34,6 days in the MARS group compared to 4,6±1,8 days observed in the controls in whom <b>hemodiafiltration</b> and standard care (SMT) was applied. This resulted in a statistically significance difference in survival at 7 and 30 days (p<0.05). Authors concluded that MARS therapy, applied to liver failure patients (Child-Pugh C and UNOS 2A scores) who develop hepatorenal syndrome type I, prolonged survival compared to patients treated with SMT.|$|E
50|$|Methanol {{poisoning}} can {{be treated}} with fomepizole, or if unavailable, ethanol. Both drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition. Ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, acts as a competitive inhibitor by more effectively binding and saturating the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver thus blocking the binding of methanol. Methanol is excreted by the kidneys without being converted into the very toxic metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid. Alcohol dehydrogenase instead enzymatically converts Ethanol to Acetylaldehyde, a much less toxic organic molecule. Additional treatment may include sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, and hemodialysis or <b>hemodiafiltration</b> to remove methanol and formate from the blood. Folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate.|$|E
50|$|High-flux {{dialysis}} membranes and/or intermittent on-line <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (IHDF) {{may also}} be beneficial in reducing complications of beta-2-microglobulin accumulation. Because beta-2-microglobulin is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of about 11,600 daltons, it does not pass at all through low-flux dialysis membranes. Beta-2-M is removed with high-flux dialysis, but is removed even more efficiently with IHDF. After several years (usually at least 5-7), patients on hemodialysis begin to develop complications from beta-2-M accumulation, including carpal tunnel syndrome, bone cysts, and deposits of this amyloid in joints and other tissues. Beta-2-M amyloidosis can cause very serious complications, including spondyloarthropathy, and often is associated with shoulder joint problems. Observational studies from Europe and Japan have suggested that using high-flux membranes in dialysis mode, or IHDF, reduces beta-2-M complications in comparison to regular dialysis using a low-flux membrane.|$|E
5000|$|In children, {{hemodialysis}} {{has to be}} individualized {{and viewed}} as an [...] "integrated therapy" [...] considering their long-term exposure to chronic renal failure treatment. Dialysis is seen only as a temporary measure for children compared with renal transplantation because this enables {{the best chance of}} rehabilitation in terms of educational and psychosocial functioning. In long term chronic dialysis, however, the highest standards should be applied to these children to preserve their future [...] "cardiovascular life" [...] which might include more dialysis time and on-line <b>hemodiafiltration</b> online hdf with synthetic high flux membranes with surface area of 0.2sq.m to 0.8sq.m and blood tubing lines with low volume yet large blood pump segment of 6.4/8.0mm, if we are able to improve on the rather restricted concept of small-solute urea dialysis clearance.|$|E
50|$|Artificial liver {{support systems}} are aimed to {{temporally}} replace native liver detoxification functions {{and they use}} albumin as scavenger molecule to clear the toxins involved in the physiopathology of the failing liver. Most of the toxins that accumulate in the plasma of patients with liver insufficiency are protein bound, and therefore conventional renal dialysis techniques, such as hemofiltration, hemodialysis or <b>hemodiafiltration</b> {{are not able to}} adequately eliminate them.Between the different albumin dialysis modalities, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) has shown some positive results at a very high cost; it has been proposed that lowering the concentration of albumin in the dialysate does not seem to affect the detoxification capability of the procedure. Nevertheless, the most widely used systems today are based on hemodialysis and adsorption. These systems use conventional dialysis methods with an albumin containing dialysate that is latter regenerate by means of adsorption columns, filled with activated charcoal and ion exchange resins. At present, there are two artificial extracorporeal liver support systems: the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS)10 from Gambro and Fractionated Plasma Separation and Adsorption (FPSA), commercialised as Prometheus (PROM) from Fresenius Medical Care.13 Of the two therapies, MARS is the most frequently studied, and clinically used system to date.|$|E
5000|$|The Dialytrauma Concept was {{introduced}} into medical literature in 2008 by a Spanish group of intensivists. The idea was born {{as a consequence}} of the publication of the first major trial (known as the ATN Study) looking at the intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, renal support was delivered using different RRT modalities: intermittent hemodialysis, sustained low-efficiency dialysis, or continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration.</b> The main result of this study (including 1,124 patients) was that a fixed “intensive” dose (35 mL/Kg/h) delivered with different RRT modalities, produced the same clinical outcomes than a “less-intensive” dose (20 mL/Kg/h). The authors’ conclusion was that critically ill patients with AKI requiring RRT should be treated with this “less-intensive” dose, given that it will achieve the same results as the “intensive” one. Nevertheless, the rate of complications and adverse events detected was higher in the “intensive” dose arm of this study. As such, the aforementioned Spanish group of intensivists, wrote a letter to the Editor of the same Journal2 postulating the idea that all those complications (grouped under the term “Dialytrauma”) could have been responsible for the results of the ATN Study.In the same letter to the Editor, and according to what had been previously published by Dr. Schiffl, they hypothesized that a dynamic adjustment of the dose of RRT, would be more physiological due to the dynamic nature of AKI in critical illness. This therapeutic schedule, named “Dynamic Approach”, would reduce the incidence of dialytrauma and, probably, would achieve better clinical outcomes.However, given the lack of level 1 clinical trials on this “Theory of Dynamic Approach”, the authors of the ATN Study branded this idea as being “speculative”. Despite this, a year later Dr. Palevsky (ATN Study’s first author) wrote an Editorial comment on the RENAL Study (the second major trial looking at the intensity of renal support) concluding that the: [...] Failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with more intensive renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients … does not imply that the intensity of renal-replacement therapy does not matter. ... Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that patient care needs to be individualized - more intensive therapy may be required for the treatment of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or extreme hypercatabolism - and that the true adequacy of renal-replacement therapy is defined by more than just the clearance of small solutes. Palevsky PM,«Renal Support in Acute Kidney Injury — How Much Is Enough?» (2009)N Engl J Med 361(17):1699-1701. [...] In this way, finally, he seemed to support the Theory of Dynamic Approach, that is: we need to tailor the RRT dose to the clinical scenario of the individual patient. From then on, both the Dialytrauma Concept and the Theory of Dynamic Approach have been referenced in several publications by impact groups in the field of RRT.|$|E

BackgroundIncreased middle-molecular uremic toxin removal {{seems to}} favorably influence survival in dialysis patients. The {{aim of this}} study was to verify if, in on-line mixed <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> solute removal by convection may be enhanced by forcing the ultrafiltration rate (QUF) and optimizing the infusion technique in order to achieve the highest possible filtration fraction (FF). MethodsRemoval of β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 -m), urea, creatinine, and phosphate were compared in 20 patients randomly submitted to one dialysis session (A), one postdilution <b>hemodiafiltration</b> session (B), and three sessions of mixed <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (C, D, and E) at different infusion rates (QS). In mixed <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> a newly developed feedback system automatically maintained the transmembrane pressure (TMP) within its highest range of safety (250 to 300 mm Hg) at constant QUF, while ensuring the maximum FF by splitting infusion between pre- and postdilution. ResultsA mean QS of 134 ± 20 mL/min (mean FF = 0. 65) was attained in post-HDF, and up to 307 ± 41 mL/min (mean FF = 0. 69) in mixed <b>hemodiafiltration.</b> The mean dialysate clearances (KDQ) for all tested solutes and urea eKt/V were significantly higher in all <b>hemodiafiltration</b> sessions than in dialysis. Only in the case of urea did the infusion mode have no significant effect. KDQ for β 2 -m was maximal in session D and significantly higher than in session B (90. 2 ± 11 mL/min vs. 77. 5 ± 11 mL/min; P = 0. 02). KDQ for β 2 -m significantly correlated with QS and the plasma water flow rate (QPW). The highest KDQ for β 2 -m was found at values of QS∼ QPW. Beyond this value KDQ decreased. ConclusionThe mixed infusion mode in <b>hemodiafiltration,</b> controlled by the TMP-ultrafiltration feedback, seems to improve the efficiency of <b>hemodiafiltration</b> by fully exploiting the convective mechanism of solute removal. The feedback automatically adjusted the infusion rate and site to the maximum FF taking into account flow conditions, internal pressures, and hydraulic permeability of the dialyzer and their complex interactions...|$|E
40|$|Online <b>hemodiafiltration</b> is a {{promising}} dialysis technique with superior removal of uremic toxins {{as compared to}} conventional hemodialysis. Whether <b>hemodiafiltration</b> leads to improved clinical outcome is currently under investigation in the Dutch CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST). In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the design and rationale of the CONTRAST study is described extensively. All data presented in this thesis originates from the CONTRAST study.

In this prospective study, we randomly assigned 714 chronic hemodialysis patients to online postdilution <b>hemodiafiltration</b> (n= 358) or to continue low-flux hemodialysis (n= 356). The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. The main secondary endpoint was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, therapeutic coronary intervention, therapeutic carotid intervention, vascular intervention, or amputation. After a mean 3. 0 years of follow-up (range, 0. 4 - 6. 6 years), we did not detect {{a significant difference between}} treatment groups with regard to all-cause mortality (121 versus 127 deaths per 1000 person-years in the online <b>hemodiafiltration</b> and low-flux hemodialysis groups, respectively; hazard ratio, 0. 95; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 75 - 1. 20).

40|$|Both {{survival}} {{and quality of}} life (QoL) are poor in patients on hemodialysis. Earlier studies have shown their QoL to be lower than in patients with for instance chronic heart failure, arthritis and metastatic colon cancer. Hemodialysis patients do not only face the symptoms of end-stage renal disease, but also the challenges of a demanding therapy. It is therefore important to explore determinants of QoL to ameliorate this outcome. Online <b>hemodiafiltration</b> might be such a determinant. It is a relatively new dialysis therapy that improves the clearance of middle molecular weight substances. It was hypothesized that due to this improved correction of the uremic environment, <b>hemodiafiltration</b> could decrease cardiovascular damage and thus cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as compared to low-flux hemodialysis. As resources in health care are scarce, there is an increasing demand that the surplus value of a new therapy is not only addressed by showing its effectiveness, but also by proving its cost-effectiveness. It was the aim of this thesis to evaluate both costs and outcomes in hemodialysis and <b>hemodiafiltration.</b> This thesis mainly included data of the Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST), a randomized controlled trial with 714 patients in 29 dialysis centers in the Netherlands, Norway and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned to either <b>hemodiafiltration</b> or hemodialysis. QoL was measured every year with a questionnaire, the Kidney Disease Quality of Life – Short Form (KDQOL-SF). This questionnaire combines the generic short-form 36 (SF- 36) with kidney disease-specific QoL domains. Costs were analyzed using a societal perspective. Hemodialysis patients’ QoL improved over time. Physical domains however remained behind and these were especially poor. The physical composite score was one of the domains that differed in hemodialysis patients between dialysis centers. Current clinical performance targets in dialysis care showed no relation with patients’ QoL. Various parameters of protein-energy nutritional status did show a relation, but a composite score of this entity had no better prediction of outcome than its individual components. <b>Hemodiafiltration</b> had no effect on QoL or survival if compared to hemodialysis. An on-treatment analysis however suggested a positive effect of <b>hemodiafiltration</b> on survival in patients who reach a convection volume of more than 20. 3 L per session. Even considering this fact, <b>hemodiafiltration</b> is not a cost-effective treatment. Although the additional cost of <b>hemodiafiltration</b> was relatively minor as compared to hemodialysis, it was not counterbalanced by a relevant gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY, a hypothetical year in optimal health). Physical QoL domains stayed behind in hemodialysis patients and its improvement should be a subject of future research. The variation in patients’ QoL between centers suggests room for improvement, which may be guided by the development of meaningful performance targets (e. g. on protein-energy nutritional status). <b>Hemodiafiltration</b> had no beneficial effect on survival or QoL. There may be a clinical advantage of <b>hemodiafiltration</b> as compared to hemodialysis in patients that attain > 20. 3 L of convection volume, but still, <b>hemodiafiltration</b> is not cost-effective. Perhaps the surplus costs of <b>hemodiafiltration</b> can be reduced in the future; otherwise cost-effective alternatives for traditional in-center hemodialysis should be pursued...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration or continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> on endothelin and corticotropin-releasing factor release or clearance during prolonged fetal cardiac bypass and on the overall performance of fetuses. MethodsCirculating endothelin 1, 2, and 3 and corticotropin-releasing factor levels were measured in fetal ewes during a 60 -minute cardiac bypass period performed with an inline axial flow pump. Blood samples were collected before, during, and 90 minutes after cardiac bypass. Animals were divided into 4 groups. The betamethasone group (n = 6) received maternal treatment with 12 mg of betamethasone 1 and 2 days before the experiment. The methylprednisolone group (n = 5) received fetal treatment with 40 mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone {{at the beginning of}} cardiac bypass. The continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> group (n = 4) underwent continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> with a 0. 3 -m 2 polysulfone filter during cardiac bypass. The final group was the control group (n = 4). ResultsMaternal steroid pretreatment failed to decrease endothelin or corticotropin-releasing factor production when compared with levels in the control animals. Fetal treatment with methylprednisolone produced a significant decrease in endothelin 2 production during cardiac bypass (P <. 02) and endothelin 1 production {{at the end of the}} experiment (P <. 02). Continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> blocked completely the increase of endothelin and corticotropin-releasing factor levels during cardiac bypass (P <. 02), which was maintained 90 minutes after cardiac bypass. Acid-base balance was preserved during cardiac bypass by the continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> but worsened after disconnection of the extracorporeal circuit, whereas animals treated with methylprednisolone had better pH, Paco 2, and bicarbonate levels by the end of the experiment. The overall tolerance of the procedure was better in the continuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> group during cardiac bypass and in the methylprednisolone group at the end of the experiment. ConclusionsContinuous venovenous <b>hemodiafiltration</b> provides sustained stability of endothelin levels during fetal cardiac bypass.

Resistance to β 2 -microglobulin transfer between body compartments could explain this observation. β 2 -Microglobulin kinetics were determined in patients receiving on-line post-dilution <b>hemodiafiltration</b> for 4 [*]h with 18 [*]l of filtration. Plasma β 2 -microglobulin concentrations were measured during and for 2 [*]h following <b>hemodiafiltration</b> and immediately before the next treatment. The filter clearance of β 2 -microglobulin was determined from arterial and venous concentrations. The β 2 -microglobulin generation rate was calculated from {{the change in the}} plasma concentration between treatments. The intercompartmental clearance was obtained by fitting the observed concentrations to a two-compartment, variable volume model. The plasma clearance of β 2 -microglobulin by the filter was 73 ± 2 [*]ml/min. Plasma β 2 -microglobulin concentrations decreased by 68 ± 2 % from pre- to post-treatment (27. 1 ± 2. 2 – 8. 5 ± 0. 7 [*]mg/l), but rebounded by 32 ± 3 % over the next 90 [*]min. The generation rate of β 2 -microglobulin was 0. 136 ± 0. 008 [*]mg/min.

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is a {{malignancy}} with excessive {{production of}} monoclonal proteins. At disease presentation 30 % of MM patients have significant renal impairment which may progress to renal failure requiring dialysis. Besides chemotherapy extracorporeal elimination procedures such as plasma exchange {{have been applied}} as adjuvant strategies to eliminate free light chains from circulating blood, however the efficacy was poor with older techniques. We report about a highly efficient method to eliminate serum free light chain (sFLC) using a newly designed protein leaking membrane in patients suffering from sFLC induced acute renal failure. The protein leaking membrane (HCO 1100) is characterized by increased pore size facilitating elimination of middle molecules such as sFLC kappa (22. 5 kD). The HCO 1100 membrane was applied in a hemodialysis and <b>hemodiafiltration</b> mode and compared to standard procedures (high flux hemodialysis, <b>hemodiafiltration</b> and plasma exchange). <b>Hemodiafiltration</b> with the protein leaking membrane HCO 1100 was superior to all other extracorporeal replacement strategies in eliminating sFLC-kappa from circulating blood. A median blood reduction rate of 40. 8 % (range 13. 9 % - 66. 4 %) was achieved during <b>hemodiafiltration.</b> The corresponding peak clearance rate was 25 ml/min. Importantly, the poorest elimination rate was achieved by plasma exchange followed by standard high flux hemodialysis. Extracorporeal elimination strategies with the protein leaking membrane HCO 1100 may be a promising adjuvant treatment strategy for patients with sFLC nephropathy requiring dialysis. <b>Hemodiafiltration</b> and to lesser extend also hemodialysis with the HCO 1100 hemofilter are able to eliminate substantial amounts of sFLC kappa in MM patients...|$|E

HFR Supra is a double-chamber <b>hemodiafiltration</b> {{system in which the}} ultrafiltrate returns to the patient after its regeneration through a resin cartridge that binds hydrophobic and protein-bound solutes. In the present study, we evaluated whether the HFR cartridge can also bind total p-cresol and IL- 6 and remove them from the ultrafiltrate...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{about two-thirds}} of {{hemodialysis}} patients worldwide are treated with high-flux membranes.

To have full advantage of convective solute removal, <b>hemodiafiltration</b> offers a superior modality as compared to both low-flux and high-flux hemodialysis. However, this technique is offered to only a minority of patients. In this review, we summarize the available clinical evidence on <b>hemodiafiltration</b> and define still remaining questions...|$|E
