5|$|But now, I {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone,</b> terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone,</b> till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

500|$|Lazenby said he {{experienced}} difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite {{his lack of}} acting experience, and with director Hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. Lazenby also declared that Hunt also asked {{the rest of the}} crew to keep a distance from him, as [...] "Peter thought the more <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone,</b> the better I would be as James Bond." [...] Allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with Rigg, who was already an established star. However, according to director Hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with Rigg joking to Lazenby before filming a love scene [...] "Hey George, I'm having garlic for lunch. I hope you are!" [...] Hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with Lazenby before and during shooting. For instance, to shoot Tracy's death scene, Hunt brought Lazenby to the set at 8 o'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, [...] "and I broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, and by the time we shot it at five o'clock, he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance." [...] Hunt said that if Lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, Diamonds Are Forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with Bond and Tracy driving off following their wedding, saving Tracy's murder for the pre-credit sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. The idea was discarded after Lazenby quit the role.|$|E

[...] "It was on a certain Thursday morning in December {{that the whole thing}} began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen mirror. Something, it seemed to me, stirred—something {{reflected}} in the glass, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> in my quarters." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} date announcement, Gambino stated {{he was upset}} since Glassnote Records wanted to push back its release to 2014, which he said was because [...] "it's not a holiday record and I'm not a big artist". He responded to this, saying: [...] "If it wasn't gonna be {{released}} then, I was gonna release it myself. What's the point of waiting? I feel like that's the only time people {{would be able to}} listen to it. December is the perfect time. Albums made a really big impact on me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> and everything was quiet, and I know that's when students go home, that's when everything is closed, so it's a good time to just listen to something and be yourself." [...] On October 21, he announced a release date of December 10, 2013, for the album.|$|E

2500|$|Nozomi Momoi {{was born}} in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She {{attended}} junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, {{for the rest of}} her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called [...] "a very normal job." [...] Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, [...] "I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> most of the time so I didn't bother with it." [...] She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{initially}} {{pleased with the}} script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach, and said to Leone, [...] "In the first film <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry". As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career and {{he was forced to}} sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor Franco Nero, who was filming Texas, Adios at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Several other {{witnesses}} insist {{that there was}} hostile fire during the incident. [...] Jim Rassmann, the Special Forces captain Kerry rescued, wrote, [...] "Machine-gun fire erupted from both banks of the river. … When I surfaced, all the Swift boats had left, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> taking fire from both banks. To avoid the incoming fire, I repeatedly swam under water." [...] Del Sandusky, the helmsman on Kerry's boat, PCF-94, stated, [...] "I saw the gun flashes in the jungle, and I saw the bullets skipping across the water." [...] Wayne Langhofer, who manned the machine gun on Don Droz's PCF-43, stated, [...] "There {{was a lot of}} firing going on, and it came {{from both sides of the}} river." [...] Michael Medeiros, aboard PCF-94, recalled [...] "a massive ambush. There were rockets and light machine gun fire plus small arms." [...] Jim Russell, the Psychological Operations Officer of the unit, who was on PCF-43, wrote [...] "All the time we were taking small arms fire from the beach… Anyone who doesn't think that we were being fired upon must have been on a different river." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{news of the}} German-Italian forces approach, {{retreating}} from Genoa-La Spezia region, {{which had}} been liberated by the US 92nd Division, a Brazilian armored reconnaissance squadron moved south from Parma, meeting leading units of the Axis forces in Collecchio. They first met armored cars from the 90th Panzergrenadier Division's reconnaissance unit, and then tanks (of the same division) with infantry from the 281st regimental [...] of the 148th Infantry Division. The reconnaissance squadron called for reinforcements. [...] According to Captain Pitaluga of the reconnaissance troop, [...] "I arrived in Collecchio at noon, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> until 6 pm. I had already occupied almost half the town when the infantry arrived." [...] Pitaluga's unit of M8 cars fought it out against more lightly armored German vehicles, which only had 20mm cannons. However, the Brazilian armored cars were vulnerable to tanks and anti-tank weapons; Pitaluga said of his vehicles, [...] "The M8 is for recon, not (for heavy) combat.". Like the M10 (another vehicle used then by Brazilian supporting units of Cavalry), M8 had open-topped turrets, which made them more vulnerable (than fully enclosed tanks) to anti-tank infantry close attacks, especially in urban combat, {{as was the case}} at Collecchio. Also, in this first day of the battle, the Brazilians were outnumbered by a German battalion with two or three squadrons.|$|E
