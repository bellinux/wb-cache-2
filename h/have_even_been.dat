5|$|A cold-blooded reptile, {{the painted}} turtle regulates its {{temperature}} through its environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for warmth, often alongside {{other species of}} turtle. Sometimes more than 50individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask {{on a variety of}} objects, often logs, but <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds form {{on other}} planets, {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and possibly Neptune. They <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds {{are composed of}} ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to organized beagling, beagles {{have been used}} for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar and foxes, and <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> recorded as being used to hunt stoat. In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.|$|E
5|$|Its {{circulation}} reached several thousand, {{with the}} highest estimates of about 10,000 issues, and copies of it were found from Moscow and Istanbul to Madrid and the United States. With unlicensed copies and shared subscriptions its circulation might <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> several times higher, reaching at the highest estimates close to 100,000.|$|E
5|$|The group {{retains a}} high profile largely because of their {{outrageous}} costumes, {{but also because of}} their frequent work for charitable organizations. The Hogettes have appeared in a national advertising campaign for VISA, and they provide support for many charities, including Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and March of Dimes. They have raised over US$100 million for these and other charitable causes. Despite their philanthropic work, the Hogettes are disliked by some and <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> attacked by fans of opposing teams.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]44 Magnum is {{well suited}} for game up to elk size. With precise shot {{placement}} and deep-penetrating cartridges, it <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> used to take the largest of game, including Cape Buffalo. Publisher Robert E. Petersen took a record-setting polar bear with a Smith & Wesson Model 29 [...]44 Magnum. It <b>has</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> used against elephants with success.|$|R

5|$|The {{reintroduction}} effort off the Oregon coast was not successful. However, reintroductions in 1969 and 1970 off the Washington coast {{were very}} successful and sea otters have been expanding their range since. They have now entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca {{and can be}} found almost as far east as Pillar Point. Individuals <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> seen in the San Juan Islands and northern Puget Sound.|$|E
5|$|The show is {{realistic}} in depicting {{the processes of}} both police work and criminal activity. There <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> reports of real-life criminals watching the show {{to learn how to}} counter police investigation techniques. The fifth season portrayed a working newsroom at The Baltimore Sun and was described by Brian Lowry of Variety magazine in 2007 as the most realistic portrayal of the media in film and television.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E

5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|The small {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens is a major focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also {{reduce the risk of}} an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was annoyed at the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while laughing at two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe wound in his right shoulder and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. While it was still anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E

5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E
5|$|The first box {{lacrosse}} match {{conducted in}} Australia came about {{as part of}} a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match {{as part of a}} multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> created in Australia, with P J Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of {{the rules of the game}} from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E
