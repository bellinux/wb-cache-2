5|$|Two of {{the rooms}} have large {{tapestries}} on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens, who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, {{but in the end}} he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> which was the only large room in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E

5|$|Deeply in debt, William made {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} marrying a wealthy heiress such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following {{the death of}} William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, the king was left with twelve children, but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he lived long enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones, and {{have the opportunity to}} sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. William's younger brother Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match. Two months later, the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself. Eventually, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving, and was willing to accept, even enthusiastically welcoming William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. At 25, Adelaide was half William's age.|$|E

50|$|Feeling {{unhappy and}} unappreciated in America, Duncan moved to London in 1898. There she {{performed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> wealthy, <b>drawing</b> inspiration from <b>the</b> Greek vases and bas-reliefs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Museum. The earnings from these engagements {{enabled her to}} rent a studio where she developed her work and created larger performances for the stage. From London, she traveled to Paris, where she <b>drew</b> inspiration from <b>the</b> Louvre and the Exposition Universelle of 1900.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1960s, Pickford often {{received}} visitors only by telephone, {{speaking to}} them from her bedroom. Buddy Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room.</b> A print of this image now hangs in the Library of Congress. In addition to her Oscar as best actress for Coquette (1929), Mary Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks – offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.|$|E

During the questioning of Jeremy, the Inspector finds the gloves used to move Costello that were hurriedly hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> by the three men when the police arrived. He also finds one of the playing cards from the pack dropped accidentally by Pippa earlier (In Act I when playing patience) and whose absence was not noticed by Clarissa when setting up the false bridge game.|$|E
25|$|In {{search of}} an unusual gift for her father, Maggie chances to wander into Jarvis' shop, and he shows her the bowl he had set aside for Charlotte years ago. Maggie agrees to buy it and asks that it be {{delivered}} to her home. When Jarvis discovers the barely discernible crack Amerigo had noticed, he brings it to Maggie himself, reveals the defect, and offers it at half price. While waiting for her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> he recognizes Amerigo and Charlotte in photographs on a table, and he innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl, {{three days before the}} wedding. Maggie realizes that the two were not meeting for the first time, as she had always assumed. She confronts Amerigo, who confesses to his past with Charlotte and to their affair.|$|E

[...] In 1883 Wilder traveled to London where he became a favorite of the British Royal Family. While still the Prince of Wales, King Edward VII became an admirer of Wilder and over the years would attend nearly twenty of his performances. Wilder's career eventually branched into vaudeville and in 1904 embarked on a round the world tour.|$|R

25|$|On his celebratory tour, Bragg visited Evergreen Plantation in Thibodaux, Louisiana, {{where he}} met 23-year-old Eliza Brooks Ellis, known to her friends as Elise, a wealthy sugar heiress. They were married on June 7, 1849 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> of Magnolia Manor, the Ellis plantation. The newlyweds {{relocated}} to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, on September 10. They were forced to leave this relatively comfortable assignment in October 1853 when they were transferred to Fort Gibson in the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Eight months later, they were transferred to Fort Washita, near the Texas border. The primitive conditions at these forts were unsuitable for the married couple, and after another six months Bragg requested leave, and the couple returned to Thibodaux. Bragg traveled to Washington to implore Secretary of War Jefferson Davis to reassign his artillery battery away from frontier duty, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} to the Corporation (a forerunner of the present Brighton & Hove City Council) was completed in January 1933, after which the building was {{opened to the public}} as a museum of Edwardian life, showing how a wealthy rural family would have lived and entertained at that time. As stipulated by Ellen Thomas-Stanford, Henry Roberts became Curator of Preston Manor and he and his family took up residence in the west wing. In 1936 the Preston Road frontage was set back and the main road widened. At this time the lodge, stables and gardener's cottage were demolished and the grounds to the north and west were laid out with grass and shrubs. In 1939 the Macquoid Bequest was installed in what had been Sir Charles's library and is now known as the Macquoid Room. During the Second World War Preston Manor became an Air Raid Precaution report centre, control centre and a base for a mobile First Aid post. In November 1945 HRH Princess Elizabeth came to tea at Preston Manor at the invitation of the Mayor of Brighton. It was her first public occasion. On 20 July 1947 a funeral tea was held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> for Christiana (Lily) Macdonald, with the Manor closed to the public that afternoon in respect. In 1951 Henry Roberts died and his daughter Margery became honorary curator of Preston Manor, a position she held until 1970. The Victorian servants' quarters in the semi-basement were restored and opened to the public in 1988. The walled garden was restored in the 1990s with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The way Preston Manor is presented to the public today reflects the way of life of a rich gentry family and their servants in the period before and after the First World War.|$|E

500|$|The {{separately}} published version {{had several}} significant wording differences from the theatrical version, owing to [...] "the {{contrast between the}} Gaiety Theatre's suggestiveness and the prudery expected in the drawing room". <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> version, the song's little maid sat by Cousin Robin's knee, not on it.

500|$|The massive chimneypiece <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> is classically designed, {{believed}} to be inspired {{by one of the}} great Italian architects of 16th-century Mannerism, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. It is two storeys in height, the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic. The distribution of the members is regular, and the shafts of the columns are variegated marble. The upper compartment of the chimney-piece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material, and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre. The fireplace is [...] wide and [...] high, and retains the ancient andirons, used for burning wood. These are large and well adorned, particularly in the lower part.|$|E

500|$|The play {{repeatedly}} mocks Victorian {{traditions and}} social customs, {{marriage and the}} pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> discussion, [...] "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," [...] says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} writer Bridget Cherry {{wrote that}} [...] "the sturdy exterior gives little {{hint of the}} fantasy [...] created inside", interiors which the art historian and Burges scholar Charles Handley-Read described as [...] "at once opulent, aggressive, obsessional, enchanting, their grandeur border on grandiloquence". Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: in the hall it is Time; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> Love; in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, described by Crook as [...] "veritable altars of art... {{some of the most}} amazing pieces of decoration Burges ever designed". Handley-Read considered that Burges's decorations were [...] "unique, almost magical [...] quite unlike anything designed by his contemporaries".|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, Burges having {{avoided the}} error {{that he had}} made at the McConnochie House when he placed a vast central staircase {{in the middle of the}} building. At The Tower House, the stair is consigned to the conical tower. The ground floor contains a drawing room, dining room and library, while the first floor holds bedroom suites and a study. If Burges shunned exterior decoration at The Tower House, he more than compensated internally. Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: that of the hall is Time, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> Love, in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, a castle in the Library and mermaids and sea-monsters of the deep in his own bedroom.
