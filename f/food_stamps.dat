40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the federal <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program on the consumption of food and the potential effects the incidence of obesity among <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> recipients. Obviously, an effective <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program will lead to an increase in the consumption of food. However, if the <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program, because of the fixed quantity nature of its implementation, has led to an “over-consumption ” of food and increased incidence of obesity, then switching from a fixed quantity subsidy to a cash grant would reduce the incidence of obesity among the poor. To examine these issues, this paper starts with a theoretical analysis using a standard microeconomic model of consumer optimization to analyze the effects of a <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program on the consumption of food and the effect that switching from a <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program to a program that provides a cash grant has on food consumption.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examines}} whether {{the mental health}} consequences associated with food insufficiency vary by <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> participation status and/or {{the value of the}} <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> benefit received. Methods. We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics along with fixed-effect methods that control for unobserved heterogeneity to test our hypotheses. Results. We find that, conditional on the <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> benefit amount, the emotional distress associated with food insufficiency is higher among <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> participants. Moreover, we find evidence of a dosage effect such that food-insufficient individuals who receive higher amounts of <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> benefits suffer greater emotional distress than food-insuffi-cient individuals who receive lower levels of <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> benefits. However, the negative mental health effects of food insufficiency and <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> participation are driven primarily by periods of transition onto the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program and into food insufficiency. Conclusions. The negative mental health aspects of participating in the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program seem to outweigh the positive mental health aspects, at least during the period of application and initial receipt, suggesting that program-matic reform is needed to improve overall well-being among new participants. Mental health problems are of great social, economic, and policy concern. A recent review estimated that every year, 5 to 6 million workers in the United States lose, fail to seek, or fail to obtain employment because of psychiatric disorders; in addition, mental illness decreases annual income by $ 3, 500 – 6, 000 (Marcotte and Wilcox-Gok, 2001). Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety are higher in women than in men, lower in blacks and higher in Hispanics compared to whites, and are inversely related to educational level and income (Kessler et al., 1994). High rates of food insecurity and hunger are also a significant problem in the United States. nDirect correspondence to Colleen Heflin, Harry S Truman School of Public Affairs...|$|R
