5|$|The Desmond Crough {{series was}} the first series of {{banknotes}} for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Crough, then the last governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than Harare, as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the <b>Guilloché</b> technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Carving {{in relief}} is common enough, idols being {{produced}} in many forms. The South African carves {{the handle of}} his spoon perhaps {{in the form of}} a giraffe, and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The North American Indian shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of pipe stems. The Papuan has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the <b>guilloche.</b> The native of New Guinea also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in Scandinavian countries. The work of the New Zealander is greatly in advance of the average primitive type; he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The Maori wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the Hindu he has a good idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion {{consider}} the heavily decorated late 17th-century ceilings {{of the house}} to be [...] "the finest single architectural legacy among the country houses of the region". As in Plas Taliaris and several other country houses in the county, the ceilings are panelled, with [...] "thick moulded beams and wreaths in the panels and winged cherubs' heads in the corners". The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including <b>guilloché,</b> acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A strongroom with [...] walls and heavy steel fire-proof doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables. On the upper floors are rooms with 18th-century fittings, including [...] "panelled dados, lugged architraves, low relief plaster ceilings and closets within angled turrets". The bedroom on the northeast of the house features a particularly detailed coffered ceiling with floral patterns.|$|E
2500|$|All {{large and}} small size bills (50 to 1000000 K): T. W. or W or T. WILLI to show {{the name of the}} {{inventor}} of the photo <b>guilloche</b> technique used to print the state notes (Traugott Willi ??? he prepared line drawing for a CHF banknote [...] ) ...|$|E
2500|$|Elements in this {{vocabulary}} {{include the}} geometrical meander or [...] "Greek key", egg-and-dart, bead and reel, Vitruvian scroll, <b>guilloche,</b> {{and from the}} plant world the stylized acanthus leaves, volute, palmette and half-palmette, plant scrolls of various kinds, rosette, lotus flower, and papyrus flower. Originally used prominently on Archaic vases, as figurative painting developed these were usually relegated to serve as borders demarcating edges of the vase or different zones of decoration. Greek architecture was notable for developing sophisticated conventions for using mouldings and other architectural ornamental elements, which used these motifs in a harmoniously integrated whole.|$|E
2500|$|Holographic strip (optically {{variable}} device): The holographic strip is {{a special}} film applied on the left end of the obverse. On the top, middle {{and bottom of the}} strip, are three sets of changing images: [...] "map of Korea," [...] "taegeuk (two comma roundel)," [...] and [...] "the four trigrams." [...] When the banknote is tilted, each of them appears in turn. Between the sets of changing images, the denomination, 50,000, is printed vertically on the strip. On the left top and bottom of the holographic strip, against a background of geometric <b>guilloche,</b> the words [...] "BANK OF KOREA 50000" [...] are printed vertically. A line of a Korean traditional lattice pattern is embossed on the strip's right end.|$|E
2500|$|As {{explained}} above, {{there are}} two varieties of foreign certificates. For the 1978 banknote series, foreign certificates, called [...] "Pakkundon", meaning [...] "exchangeable money" [...] were implemented by an overstamp and serial number color. This was intended to protect {{the value of the}} national currency in North Korea's command economy. These were first released in 1983 in two forms, one for [...] "socialist visitors" [...] which had a red stamp, and one for [...] "capitalist visitors" [...] which had a green stamp. Another series was released in 1986 with either a blue or red <b>Guilloché</b> style stamp. These were issued in all denominations, except for the ₩100 note, presumably because it was assumed by the government that foreigners would not show proper respect for its depiction of Kim Il-sung. These notes were discontinued in 1988 and replaced with a new series of Pakkundon in all banknote form that was more distinguishable and unmistakable from generic circulation currency.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{sections}} include the porch, a middle room and an inner room or sanctum. The middle room measures [...] by [...] {{in size and}} is lined with lion reliefs, <b>guilloché,</b> and panels resembling window. The square main hall measures [...] by at the rear end of this hall reliefs and a stele were added as part of shrine. There are basalt reliefs in the lower wall panels. An elevated podium ( [...] high platform), a niche, and a secondary wall {{are part of the}} visible remains. In the small shrine area situated at the innermost area of the temple, carved sockets and grooves are seen on the wall, which point to the former presence of a wooden screen. A ramp joins the main room to the platform area and the sanctum. The back wall of the sanctum has a niche which probably housed a statue of a god or goddess. Paved floors and walls reliefs are visible in the multistoried hallways, at least three stories high, that flank three sides of the temple, with at least one southern entrance. Figure-eight lattice patterns are included on two false, recessed windows that were carved into the temple walls. While all these were dated as part of first and second phase creations, material remains unearthed at the site identify additions made in the third phase of construction, an [...] "ambulatory with a series of side chambers on three sides of the temple". It has also been inferred that these chambers were part of the pre-existing temple platform and not linked to the main temple.|$|E
2500|$|The {{openwork}} of the tiara and collar represent tiny {{heads of}} Portuguese {{men in the}} tiara of both the Met and the British Museum examples, with eleven figures in the British Museum mask, and in the Met mask seven figures of Portuguese men alternating with six representations of mudfish, the West African lungfish. [...] The Portuguese, who had only recently arrived in the area, were a symbol of power and affluence to the royal court. Their iconography is identifiable by their long hair, hanging mustaches (often described as bearded), and domed hats. Benin art historian Barbara Blackmun interprets these crown adornments as a reference to Idia's ability to conduct the Portuguese power to her son's favor. Mudfish were a common theme in Benin royal arts, and reflected the divinity of the Oba. Edo cosmology believed that spirits crossed the ocean to reach the afterlife, where their leaders lived like gods. As creatures who could live on land and sea, the mudfish symbolized the duality needed for the leader's final journey, and this duality represents the seafaring Portuguese as well. [...] The mudfish also appear in a pattern on the Linden Museum mask's crown, while the private collection mask's crown has bird elements, also formerly present on the similar Seattle Art Museum mask. [...] The masks also differ in pattern along their bottom, collar edges. The collar of the Met example is similarly decorated with eleven Portuguese men (with damage on its proper right side), while the collar of the British Museum mask is instead an abstract <b>guilloché</b> latticework.|$|E
2500|$|The State Dining Room is [...] Located to {{the west}} of The State Drawing Room, created in the 1740s the {{probable}} architect being either Henry Flitcroft or 'Capability' Brown. The Stowe House Preservation Trust are currently fundraising to restore this room to its former magnificence. This was The State Gallery until 1817 when it assumed its current name. The ceiling has an elaborate plaster entablature supporting a deep cove, this has painted decoration dated 1747 by Francesco Sleter, including Hebe feeding Jupiter's Eagle east, Cupid playing with two Graces north, Cupid asleep with two Graces south and Diana and her Hounds west, the spaces between these paintings are decorated with animals including swans and their cygnets, pigeons and rabbits. There are three large octagonal paintings on the central flat of the ceiling. These are probably early 19th century replacements for the original by Robert Jones. They are Venus disarming Cupid east, Venus on her Chariot, crowned by Cupid and attended by the Three Graces centre and Venus at her Toilet, attended by the Graces west. There are also eight smaller octagonal panels depicting pairs of vases and classical reliefs. The areas between these paintings are decorated with painted acanthus and all the paintings are bordered by white and gilt plaster beams decorated in <b>guilloché.</b> The two chimneypieces on the north wall date from the 1920s the original pair were sold in 1922 and are now at Benham Park, these were of white and yellow Siena marbles, with elaborately carved wooded overmantels that contained paintings now in America, these are Goddess conducting Learning east and Mercury conducting Tragedy and Comedy to Parnassus. There are four paintings above the two doors in the west and east walls of male and female centaurs with Bacchic emblems and lyres, probably painted by Robert Jones. The walls used to be hung with five Brussels tapestries commissioned by Viscount Cobham from O. Leyneir, they depict the triumph of classical deities: Ceres, Bacchus, Neptune, Mars and Diana, sold in 1921 they are now in Switzerland. The dining table when fully extended was [...] long. The walls are hung with various portraits of people associated with the house and family that have been acquired over the years, these are, on the east wall Caroline Harvey wife of the 3rd Duke by Sir Francis Grant, donated by the granddaughter of the sitter, The Hon. Mrs. Thomas Close-Smith (1886-1972) on her death in 1972; above the eastern fireplace Queen Caroline of Ansbach from the studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller; in the centre of the north wall Lady Christian Lyttelton the sister of Viscount Cobham, a copy of a portrait by Kneller; over the western fireplace King George II from the studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller; and on the west wall A Lady in Eastern Costume on a Terrace with a Peacock possibly Lady Hester Stanhope by James Northcote, she was the great-granddaughter of Sir Richard Temple 3rd Baronet.|$|E
60|$|IV. The first {{so-called}} ornament, then, which I {{would attack}} is that Greek fret, now, I believe, usually {{known by the}} Italian name <b>Guilloche,</b> which is exactly a case in point. It so happens that in crystals of bismuth formed by the unagitated cooling of the melted metal, there occurs a natural resemblance of it almost perfect. But crystals of bismuth not only are of unusual occurrence in every-day life, but their form is, as far as I know, unique among minerals; and not only unique, but only attainable by an artificial process, the metal itself never being found pure. I do not remember any other substance or arrangement which presents a resemblance to this Greek ornament; and I think that I may trust my remembrance as including most of the arrangements which occur in the outward forms of common and familiar things. On this ground, then, I allege that ornament to be ugly; or, in the literal sense of the word, monstrous; different from anything which it {{is the nature of}} man to admire: and I think an uncarved fillet or plinth infinitely preferable to one covered with this vile concatenation of straight lines: unless indeed it be employed as a foil to a true ornament, which it may, perhaps, sometimes with advantage; or excessively small, as it occurs on coins, the harshness of its arrangement being less perceived.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guilloche</b> {{describes}} a narrow instance of guilloche: a design, frequently architectural, using two curved bands that interlace {{in a pattern}} around a central space. Some dictionaries give only this definition of <b>guilloche,</b> although others include the broader meaning associated with <b>guilloché</b> as a second meaning. Note that in the original sense, even a straight line can be <b>guilloché,</b> and persons using the French spelling and pronunciation generally intend the broader, original meaning.Translucent enamel was applied over <b>guilloché</b> metal by Peter Carl Fabergé on the Faberge eggs and other pieces from the 1880s.|$|E
50|$|The first small {{vineyard}} on {{the estate}} were planted in 1476, in a location named La Lobeyra, on land owned by the <b>Guilloche</b> family since 1398. During the period from 1510 to 1550 many land plots were acquired by Pierre de <b>Guilloche</b> and his son Jean de <b>Guilloche.</b> Lady Roquetaillade, the heiress to the <b>Guilloche</b> family, sold La Louvière in 1618 to Arnaud de Gascq, abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Ferme. He donated it in 1620 to Notre Dame de Miséricorde, a Carthusian Order in Bordeaux. At this stage the property was in a poor state, but was restored by the monks. Under the monks' management, both red and white wines were produced during the early parts of the 17th century, and shipped to customers in Picardy, England and Flanders.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "guilloche" [...] is {{also used}} more {{generally}} for repetitive architectural patterns of intersecting or overlapping spirals or other shapes, as used in the Ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome and neo-classical architecture, and Early Medieval interlace decoration in Anglo-Saxon art and elsewhere. Medieval Cosmatesque stone inlay designs with two ribbons winding around a series of regular central points are very often called <b>guilloche.</b> These central points are often blank, but may contain a figure, such as a rose. [...] These senses are a back-formation from the engraving <b>guilloché,</b> so called because the architectural motifs resemble the designs produced by later <b>guilloché</b> techniques.|$|E
