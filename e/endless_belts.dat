Downstream of the nip, the twisted yarn is drawn sequentially across first and second runs of travelling <b>endless</b> <b>belts,</b> such that the yarn wraps about a first convex surface of the first run, then passes {{between the first and second}} runs, before wrapping about a second convex surface of the second run. Friction between each of the first and second convex surfaces and the yarn imparts the false twist in a common direction.

40|$|NASA-Arnes' major {{recommendations}} involved ways {{of extending}} cable {{life in the}} interests of safety and economy. Other recommendations included redesign of the cablegripping device, substitution of modern braking mechanisms, improvements in cable pulleys and other components, and new inspection and repair procedures.

These cables-four of them for four different car routes [...] are <b>endless</b> <b>belts,</b> like ski lift cables, running from the downtown car barn to the end of each line. When a cable is installed, the loop is closed by splicing the ends together in a 72 -footlong splice. The splice is the weakest part of the cable and a source of problems. When the car operator applies his grip while over a splice, the resulting friction sometimes causes the splice to "unbraid" and fail; this means shutting down the line until the splice can be repaired. Even when unbraiding does not occur, gripping a splice shortens cable life by friction wear. Worn cables are a safety hazard and must be replaced, which is expensive at $ 1. 60 a foot for 10, 000 to 20, 000 feet of cable...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{devices were}} designed and manufactured {{to study the}} use of mechanical impact and rubbing (friction and compression) to thresh soybeans pods. Threshing efficiency and seed damage were evaluated. The energy absorbed by pods as they shatter and the energy required to operate both devices were estimated and compared with the energy used by conventional combines to thresh soybeans. ^ The impact device was basically made of two parallel walls which hit the plants in a transverse reciprocating motion. The rubbing device connected pairs of vertical rollers driving two, facing each other, <b>endless</b> <b>belts</b> at different speeds and with adjustable gaps between them. The plants were fed either between the walls or belts to simulate the movement of both devices over a row of plants. ^ The impact device threshed 92. 5 % of the soybeans. Threshing efficiency increased significantly with decreasing levels of pod moisture content. The seed damage was within acceptable levels despite the trend to increase with increasing impact speeds and decreasing pod moisture content. The estimated energy absorbed per pod at 10 % moisture content was 0. 0127 J. The energy used by conventional combines was 20 % higher than that required by the impact device, and around 30 {{times higher than the}} total energy absorbed by pods during shattering. ^ The rubbing device threshed over 92. 5 % of the soybeans from 10 % moisture pods at any belt speed. There was no significant seed mechanical damage. The energy absorbed per pod was 0. 0123 J. The energy used by conventional combines was over 100 times higher than that absorbed by pods as they shattered, 12 times higher than that required by plants (pods and stems), and more than 4 times that required by the rubbing device. ^ Both devices performed satisfactory threshing with little seed mechanical damage and a relatively low level of energy consumption. These results support the conclusion that there is potential to improve soybean harvesting equipment. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} an {{electrostatic}} generator in which charge is mechanically transported in small amounts into {{the interior of a}} high voltage electrode originated with the Kelvin water dropper, invented during 1867 by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), in which charged drops of water fall into a bucket with the same polarity charge, adding to the charge. In a machine of this type the gravitational force moves the drops against the opposing electrostatic field of the bucket. Kelvin himself first suggested using a belt to carry the charge instead of water. The first electrostatic machine that used an <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> to transport charge was constructed during 1872 by Augusto Righi. It used an india rubber belt with wire rings along its length as charge carriers, which passed into a spherical metal electrode. The charge was applied to the belt from the grounded lower roller by electrostatic induction using a charged plate. John Gray also invented a belt machine about 1890. [...] Another more complicated belt machine was invented during 1903 by Juan Burboa [...] A more immediate inspiration for Van de Graaff was a generator W. F. G. Swann was developing during the 1920s in which charge was transported to an electrode by falling metal balls, thus returning to the principle of the Kelvin water dropper.|$|R
