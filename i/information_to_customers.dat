2500|$|Blagojevich {{issued an}} {{executive}} order during 2004 requiring pharmacists {{in the state to}} dispense [...] "morning-after" [...] birth control, even if they object on moral or religious grounds. This order was legally challenged. Later in 2007, opponents of the governor's executive order reached a settlement with the state in one case, causing partial removal of the order. The settlement, which followed the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in September 2007 to hear an appeal of a lawsuit challenging the executive order, allowed pharmacists to decline to dispense birth control, so long as they provided <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> about pharmacists who did. In another case, Morr-Fitz v. Blagojevich (later Morr-Fitz v. Quinn), the Illinois Court of Appeals ruled against Blagojevich's order.|$|E

"We {{doubt that}} the village's {{restriction}} on the manner of marketing appreciably limits Flipside's communication of information—with one obvious and telling exception," [...] Marshall wrote. In a footnote, {{he pointed out that}} the record store had testified at trial that it placed many of those items near the cash register because they were either likely to be impulse purchases best placed at the point of sale or because they were small and likely to be shoplifted, not because it had wanted to communicate any particular <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers.</b> [...] "The ordinance is expressly directed at commercial activity promoting or encouraging illegal drug use," [...] Marshall said. [...] "If that activity is deemed 'speech,' then it is speech proposing an illegal transaction, which a government may regulate or ban entirely." [...] The overbreadth doctrine not only did not apply, it could not apply since it did not cover commercial speech, something the Court had implied in another case two years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Interviews with {{strippers}} {{have revealed}} that the customers are generally viewed as [...] "suckers" [...] for giving the dancers money just for their physical attraction. Dancers, {{in an attempt to}} acquire a tip or monetary reward, may be selling more than just attractiveness and fantasy. [...] They portray feelings of intimacy and emotional connectedness for their customers {{and most of the time}} these portrayals are overstated or false. The stage persona is different from who they are backstage, even if it does mirror aspects of their true personality. Within the context of the strip club, dancers might sometimes give the impression that they are revealing private (or backstage) <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> in order to play a confidence game for increased profit. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their [...] "front" [...] while in the club. Customers rarely, if ever, see the preparation of these props, since they are denied access to the backstage of a dancer's performance space by the layout of the club. A customer often wants a dancer to [...] "drop the act", which makes them feel special and desired. This girlfriend experience can involve increased intimacy up to and including sex acts. Dancers are commonly aware of this customer desire for increased confidence, and may allow the impression that a customer is seeing their true selves. In reality, it is often just part of the act with little to no emotional attachment for the dancer.|$|E
