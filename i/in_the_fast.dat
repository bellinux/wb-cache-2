5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E

5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the metabolic substrate pool for energy production during exercise when fed carbohydrates is shifted from fat to carbohydrates. The magnitude of the shift towards increased carbohydrate oxidation versus decreased fat oxidation is highly dependent on the timing of <b>the</b> carbohydrate intake. <b>In</b> this respect, {{it has been shown}} that pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion limits fat oxidation through both inhibition of peripheral lipolysis and inhibition of intramuscular fat oxidation, whereas glucose intake during exercise only marginally blunts peripheral lipolysis without affecting total fat oxidation. It has thus been argued that the presence of a high insulin concentration already at the onset of exercise is of major importance in promoting decreased rates of fat oxidation. Carbohydrate intake before and during endurance exercise is a standard ‘ergogenic’ procedure. Still, the vast majority of literature studies that have looked at muscle metabolism in endurance exercise, have used <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state as <b>the</b> ‘standard’ dietary condition, while <b>in</b> fact <b>the</b> carbohydrate-fed state is recommended as the optimal nutritional state for endurance exercise. Thus, it was the primary aim of this dissertation to evaluate the acute and short term metabolic properties of exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> (F) versus carbohydrate fed (CHO) state. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> effect of acute metabolic state and training on intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content will be specificially highlighted. Indeed, IMCL have been shown to be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis of peripheral insulin resistance. The development of exercise strategies that increase IMCL breakdown can therefore increase the effect of non-pharmacological strategies on insulin sensitivity. <b>In</b> first study, <b>the</b> acute effect of exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state versus exercise with carbohydrate intake was evaluated. We could show that IMCL breakdown during prolonged submaximal exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state takes place in type I fibres predominantly. Furthermore, IMCL breakdown during exercise was prevented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carbohydrate-fed state. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> combination of both glucose intake both before and during exercise decreased glycogen breakdown in type IIa fibres. Exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasting</b> state enhances <b>the</b> post-exercise insulin response to glucose ingestion which in turn likely contributes to stimulation of post exercise muscle glycogen resynthesis. Finally, carbohydrate ingestion, either before, during or after exercise is a potent inhibitor of <b>the</b> exercise-induced increase <b>in</b> metabolic gene expression. Thus, exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state stimulates fat oxidation and glycogen breakdown when compared with exercise after the intake of a breakfast and with additional carbohydrate intake. It was however unclear whether exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state could affect training adaptations. Therefore, a second study investigated the effect of a short-term endurance training period (6 weeks, 3 days/week, 1 - 2 h, 75 % VO 2 peak) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state or with carbohydrate intake on training adaptations and substrate utilisation during a standardised exercise bout with carbohydrate intake. Regular exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state did not affect <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> exercise capacity. Training adaptations in muscle (enzyme activity, GLUT 4, HKII, UCP 3) were basically similar between both experimental conditions. However, gene expression, as measured via mRNA content, was markedly different between groups. Training did not affect IMCL content whereas glycogen content increased after training with carbohydrate intake but not after training <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state. During exercise, fat oxidation rates nor IMCL breakdown was influenced by training. On the opposite, regular exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state decreased glycogen breakdown versus an increase in blood glucose oxidation. Although a decrease in glycogen breakdown after exercise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fasted</b> state can have major implications on performance, we could not show major differences in overall training adaptations. status: publishe...|$|R
