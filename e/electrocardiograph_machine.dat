40|$|Power transistors, {{such as the}} vertical, double-diffused, metal-oxide {{semiconductor}} (VDMOS), are used extensively in the amplifier circuits of medical devices. The aim {{of this research was}} to construct a VDMOS power transistor with an optimized structure to enhance the operation of medical devices. First, boron was implanted in silicon by implanting unclamped inductive switching (UIS) and a Faraday shield. The Faraday shield was implanted in order to replace the gate-field parasitic capacitor on the entry part of the device. Also, implanting the UIS was used in order to decrease the effect of parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) of the VDMOS power transistor. The research tool used in this study was Silvaco software. By decreasing the transistor entry resistance in the optimized VDMOS structure, power losses and noise at the entry of the transistor were decreased, and, by increasing the breakdown voltage, the lifetime of the VDMOS transistor lifetime was increased, which resulted in increasing drain flow and decreasing Ron. This consequently resulted in enhancing the operation of high-frequency medical devices that use transistors, such as Radio Frequency (RF) and <b>electrocardiograph</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

50|$|After World War II, {{health care}} {{facilities}} received increased attention {{because of the need}} for care of veterans wounded in the war. Government money was distributed to ensure improved access to health care, and technological advances in cardiovascular and pulmonary surgery techniques, better diagnostic methods, and extended care for critically ill patients received attention. In 1953, the Memorial Pavilion was completed, with a post-anesthesia recovery room, expanded physical therapy facilities, a new classroom, and an <b>electrocardiograph</b> <b>machine.</b> The next year, though, a severe shortage of hospital beds in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area spurred hospital organizers to organize a United Hospital Fund drive. It raised $17 million for hospitals around the Twin Cities.|$|E

40|$|THE resting {{electrocardiogram}} {{is normal}} or "borderline " {{in at least}} 50 per cent of patients with ischemic heart disease and an-gina pectoris. ' In {{the great majority of}} such cases, however, tracings taken after exercise manifest diagnostic changes. A widely em-ployed, standardized method of eliciting such electrocardiographic abnormalities is the Mas-ter two-step test, 2 3 whose value in the diag-nosis of ischemic heart disease is established. The development of electronic devJices that permit the radio transmission of electrophysio-logic data from a distance i has stimulated interest in monitoring the two-step test during its actual performance. One technic for doing so with the patient remaining attached to the <b>electrocardiograph</b> <b>machine</b> has also been de-scribed. '; Since 1961, we have been evaluating several methods for recording the electrocardiogram during exercise. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to report some of the theoretical and prac-tical problems encountered in radioelectro-cardiography, and to describe a simple, inex-pensive technic for recording the electrocardi-ogram during the two-step test, with only conventional electrocardiographic equipment. Methods Differenit monitoring technics, types of equip-ment, electrodes, pastes, and electrode positioIns were employed in 80 healthy medical and nursin...|$|E
