5|$|Hurricane Gladys was the {{farthest}} tropical cyclone from the United States {{to be observed}} by radar in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Carla in 1961. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season, Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> southwest of Cape Verde on September22. Initially, the tropical depression failed to strengthened significantly, but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September24. Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> east of the northern Leeward Islands, Gladys became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scaleon September28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. Eventually, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery.|$|E

5|$|The season's eleven known storm {{identified}} several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> south of Mexico on October17. Quickly tracking northwestward, the storm attained an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its existence.

5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, {{likely in}} association with a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing a low-level circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, German {{settlers}} {{from the}} Barossa Valley travelled upstream {{to settle in}} the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious distinctiveness as Lutherans, they preferred to form clustered German settlements. In 1867 and 1868 several land parcels were taken up in the Jindera area. 56 German farmers, in 1869, took six weeks to travel six <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> in covered wagons to establish the town of Walla Walla.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was first identified as a tropical storm several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> southeast of Hawaii on September9. The storm quickly attained winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. By September11, the system weakened to a tropical depression. Later that day, the system entered an area with no ships available for reporting. However, no ships reported a storm in the region for several days, signifying the depression's dissipation.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone to form or enter the central Pacific was first identified on September25 several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> {{south of the}} Hawaiian Islands. Traveling nearly due west, the storm attained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. By September27, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated on September28 over open waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> to the east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17 a few <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> {{east of the}} Leeward Islands.

The previous times were for Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. In subsequent seasons, 'P' names would be given to Paloma in 2008, Paula in 2010, Philippe in 2011, and Patty in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} its peak intensity, Zeke began to weaken once more due to increasing westerly wind shear. By {{the early morning}} of October30, the center of circulation became devoid of thunderstorm activity and the system had turned eastward. Later that day, Zeke weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low pressure system. The NHC continued to monitor the low-level swirl of clouds associated with Zeke for several more days as the system meandered several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> south of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|On June13, 1974, a {{tropical}} disturbance was identified several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> south of Mexico. Tracking westward, rapid development ensued {{the following day}} and the system was classified {{a tropical}} depression around 12UTC. Shortly thereafter, satellite intensity estimates indicated further strengthening and the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores. Development temporarily slowed on June 15 as the structure gradually organized. Enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a band of deep convection wrapped into the storm. A banding eye-feature developed later that day, indicating Dolores to be near hurricane strength.|$|E
