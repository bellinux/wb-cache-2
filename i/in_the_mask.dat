5|$|Ballard {{went on to}} tally 34 {{points during}} his first {{campaign}} with Florida in 2008–09. The following season, on November 30, 2009, Ballard was involved in an on-ice incident that injured his own teammate, goaltender Tomáš Vokoun. After being on the ice for a goal during {{a game against the}} Atlanta Thrashers, Ballard aimed to smash his stick in frustration against the post and mistakenly hit Vokoun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Vokoun was taken from the ice on a stretcher and suffered a cut on his ear that required stitches; he missed two games before returning to the lineup. Ballard, who apologized to Vokoun following the game, was not disciplined by the Panthers or NHL. He went on to match his career-high eight goals and added 20 assists for 28 points in his second season with the Panthers. He also ranked third in the league in blocked shots with 201. Ballard had played parts of the season with a hip injury. After completing the campaign, he underwent the second hip surgery of his career in May 2010 to repair a stress fracture and remove a cyst.|$|E

She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre.

In 2005, she became the ambassador of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse.

5|$|Three days later, on March 28, goaltender Steve Mason {{was injured}} in the morning skate when a shot from Colton Gillies hit him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> With Sanford again injured, York made an {{emergency}} start. Playing against the Detroit Red Wings, York made 29 saves, including 17 in the third period, helping Columbus to a 4–2 victory and giving York his first career NHL win. York remained the starter and led the Blue Jackets to a second three-game winning streak. In his fourth start, Columbus was shut out by the Coyotes despite a franchise-record 54 shots on goal, losing 2–0. The 54 saves by Phoenix goaltender Mike Smith set an NHL record for a regulation shutout. Mason returned to the starter's role for the final two games, winning both. The two victories gave Columbus 65 points for the year, their third-lowest total in franchise history.|$|E

Blue-footed booby parents, meanwhile, build nests with steeper sides, thus preventing some older chicks from engaging in siblicidal behaviour.|$|R

More specifically, <b>the</b> problem lies <b>in</b> an unfortunate choice of values for <b>masks.</b> An unbalance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>masking</b> scheme leads to a first order leakage.

However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> condition.

2500|$|Bale had initial {{concerns}} about playing Batman, {{as he felt}} more ridiculous than intimidating in the Batsuit. He dealt with this by depicting Batman as a savage beast. To attain {{a deeper understanding of}} the character, Bale read various Batman comic books. He explained his interpretation of the young boy: [...] "Batman is his hidden, demonic rage-filled side. The creature Batman creates is an absolutely sincere creature and one that he has to control but does so in a very haphazard way. He's capable of enacting violence— and to kill— so he's constantly having to rein himself in." [...] For Bale, the most gruelling part about playing Batman was the suit. [...] "You stick it on, you get hot, you sweat and you get a headache <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> ... But I'm not going to bitch about it because I get to play Batman", he said. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie. When promoting the film in interviews and public events, Bale retained an American accent to avoid confusion. Batman Begins was released in the U.S. on 15 June 2005 and was a U.S. and international triumph for Warner Bros., costing approximately US$135 million to produce and taking in over US$370 million in returns worldwide. Bale's performance was well received by critics and fans alike, earning him the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Best Hero award at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards.
