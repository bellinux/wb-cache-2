40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The role of CAD within an overall Product Design {{teaching}} framework, at Higher Education level, is explored and reviewed. This is considered from three perspectives: Student- their expectations {{in terms of}} theoretical knowledge and competence. Academic- theory based requirements for successful achievement of learning outcomes. Employer- vocational competence requirements for <b>Product</b> Design <b>graduates.</b> With emphasis on the experiences of undergraduate and <b>graduate</b> <b>Product</b> Design students at the University of Derby, and prospective or actual graduate employers, the unique expectations and requirements within each category are considered. The overall means of resolving these, often conflicting, requirements into the CAD teaching framework of a Product Design degree, operating within a modular scheme, are then explored. The implications of these demands on teaching and assessment strategies with the subsequent resource issues are also reviewed. A teaching strategy with a well linked combination of both theory and competence with, where possible, cross-modular innovative assessment strategies {{is considered to be}} an effective approach...|$|R

50|$|In 2008, the University of Melbourne {{introduced}} the Melbourne Model, whereby Law is only {{available as a}} graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible. Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2-3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for graduate-entry into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the University of New England, Australian Catholic University, Australian National University, La Trobe University, Flinders University, Bond University, Macquarie, Monash, Deakin, UNSW, University of Tasmania, Adelaide, Victoria University, Sydney, Melbourne, Queensland University of Technology, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia and the University of Canberra.It is argued that the proliferation of Law Schools over {{the last forty years}} has greatly diminished the quality of legal education. In 1960 there were only half a dozen institutions producing no more than 1500 graduates per year in a country of then less than nineteen million. As of 2015 there are more than fifty institutions producing more than 5000 graduates per year for a population of just 21 million. This has had a double impact. The teaching faculties of institutions granting law degrees have been decreased in quality because talented teachers are spread through so many more institutions. The quality of the student intake, especially to the less recognized institutions, is greatly diminished. The <b>graduate</b> <b>product</b> has grown increasingly less acceptable to the profession and the public alike.|$|R

By examining time sheet data reported by professional student teams from a <b>graduate</b> level <b>product</b> design course, we found that emphasis on user involvement during the early stages of development actually has no correlation to the total amount of time a team had spent during their product development process.

Students in both courses are encouraged {{to participate in the}} IBL program, where six to twelve months are spent working in a relevant industry placement. This occurs one year prior to completion of the undergraduate degree. The IBL program provides students with exposure to a range of different professional practices, including project management, interpersonal skills, schedules and budgets. These are activities and aptitudes developed as a specific response to a professional context that can not be replicated in the university environment. Value of the industry experience is evident in the attitudes and work ethic demonstrated by students when they return in their final year of study. This will be substantiated by contrasting outcomes of students who have and have not completed an IBL program in addition to graduate employment. Higher levels of interpersonal skills in relation to peers, staff and external stakeholders is also consistently observed by teaching staff in students who have completed IBL. The paper both validates and evaluates the IBL program at Swinburne in PDE and ID, looking at how the program can improve in ID to increase the proportion of students who participate.

This integrated academic program consists of Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees in the Comprehensive Design Program. Bringing the students through models and experiments of the what, how, and why innovations occur in emerging technologies, the program prepares students at all degree levels to bring value to the organizations they belong to.

This model assumes that a product exists {{at the beginning of the}} life cycle. The work of the designer begins well before Moore’s model. The engineer is part of a team that transitions technology from the R&D centers into product architectures. There is a similar life cycle for this transition of technology into an innovative product. There is also an analogous gap to the Chasm referred to here as the Innovation Fence. The Innovation is the hurdle technology must jump before it is ready to be integrated into a product or service.

Weaknesses were found in the areas of art, music, physical education, reading, and science. In the teaching competencies major strengths were found in the areas of positive personality traits, capturing interest and attention, encouraging creative activity, collecting and using media and materials, and gaining trust and building student self-concept. Major weaknesses were found in the areas of helping students of varied ethnic backgrounds, correlating curriculum with that in the grades preceeding and following, making interest centers and learning stations, caring for health, safety, and muscle coordination, helping students to use inductive and deductive thinking, and helping students develop visual and auditory perception.

Surveys conducted by this committee of the membership (PT, PDD and BT sections) and a representative group of pharmaceutical executives validated this concern and provided insight into its nature and depth. For example, the executives reported that 50 % or less of product development staff have undergraduate degrees in pharmacy and that 50 % or less have advanced degrees in pharmaceutics/industrial pharmacy/pharmaceutical technology, yet entry-level PhDs in these specialties bring a better mix of skills to the product development table than their counterparts from other science disciplines, and that this advantage persist even after 4 – 6 years experience on the job. And the great difficulty in finding candidates with the, right mix of experience and education was also made clear by the surveys.
