5000|$|The creek {{is part of}} a $67 million Chinook salmon {{restoration}} project, a PG&E Battle Creek Hydroelectric Project. Many adjacent properties hold conservation easements {{protecting them}} from development. In addition to the Chinook salmon, the creek has steelhead, rainbow, and brown trout. Counterintuitively, first-year data from a post-wildfire soil erosion study funded by Sierra Pacific Industries, a large <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> company, show that control sites disturbed only by fire produced substantially more water runoff and soil erosion than did sites that received post-wildfire salvage logging. However, given this document was written by an employee of the large timber company which has extensively salvage logged the watershed, the results are questionable. Furthermore, two hydrologists' reviews of the document found substantial flaws in it. The industrial timberland in the Battle Creek watershed is upstream of the restoration project. The clearcutting and post-fire salvage logging which has been occurring since 1998 is the subject of the documentary film [...] "Clearcut Nation", produced by local residents. A Citizen’s Water Monitoring Project has been collecting water quality data both upstream and downstream of the industrial timberland since 2009.

5000|$|Despite today’s {{sophisticated}} and expensive fire-spotting and fire-fighting techniques, forest fires in Canada still burn, on average, about 28,000 square kilometres of boreal and other forest area annually. That average annual burn area {{is equivalent to}} {{more than three times}} the current annual <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> harvest. It can be many more times that in intense fire years. [...] However, although logging also removes trees, fire is not the same as logging, since fire has been a part of coniferous forests for millennia. [...] Fire not only stimulates regeneration of many plant species, it recycles phosphorus and removes accumulated organic matter. Fire is increasingly used as a management tool to maintain forest health in some parts of North America (see fire ecology). Different parts of the boreal have different burn cycles. The drier western region, which receives lower average rainfall, had higher natural fire frequencies. Hence, more area is burned annually on average in the west than in central and eastern Canada. When natural burn cycles are interrupted by fire suppression, natural renewal is obstructed and species composition is changed. In addition, fire suppression causes fuel loads to increase so that fires, when they do occur, become more intense. One can argue that fire suppression actually creates a positive feed back loop, where ever more expensive fire suppression generates the conditions for ever larger fires. The negative effects of fire suppression are still under study, and not fully measured, but they need to be considered when making decisions about the future health of boreal forests.|$|E

40|$|Degradation of {{tropical}} peats {{is a global}} concern due to large Carbon emission and loss of biodiversity. The degradation {{of tropical}} peats usually starts when the government drains and clears peat forests into open peats used for food crops, oil palm and <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> plantations. Major properties of tropical peat forests are high in Water Contents (WC), Loss on Ignition (LOI) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and low in peat pH, Dry Bulk Density (DBD), and Total Nitrogen (TN). In this study, we investigated impacts of drainage and land use change on these properties. We collected peat samples from peat forests, logged over peat forest, <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> plantation, community agriculture, and oil palms. We used independent t-tests and oneway ANOVA to analyze mean differences of the research variables. We found that peat pH, DBD, and TN tend to increase. A significant decrease of C/N ratio in oil palm and agriculture sites importantly denotes {{a high rate of}} peat decompositions. Water contents, LOI, and TOC are relatively constants. We suggest that changes in pH, DBD, TN and atomic C/N ratio are important indicators for assessing tropical peat degradation. We infer that land use change from tropical peat forests into cleared and drained peats used for intensive timber harvesting, oil palms and <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> plantations in Indonesia has greatly degraded major ecological function of tropical peats as Carbon storage...|$|E

The smallholder timber industry of the Amazon’s estuarine floodplain provides an outstand-ing example of local patterns of resource management and economic activities transformed from within by smallholder farmers {{who participated in}} the <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> boom of the 1970 s and 1980 s. These farmers of eastern Amazonia have developed a vertically integrated local industry based on expertise reflecting profound locally developed knowl-edge of specific forests and management of ecological processes, individual observation and experimentation, as well as concepts and practices derived from temporary employment by large-scale <b>industrial</b> <b>timber</b> firms. At each stage of the smallholder forestry process—from managing natural regeneration to running small sawmills and market-ing lumber—local managers apply an innovative set of practices reflecting their diverse experiences. This combi-nation of technical, market, and ecological knowledge results in forests, timber markets, and economic patterns that do not correspond to many of the widely-held generalizations concerning either local or industrial tropical timber exploitation.
