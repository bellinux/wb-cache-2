25|$|The earning to give {{strategy}} has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating {{large sums of money}} to charity. Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill have argued that the marginal impact of one's potentially unethical actions in such a lucrative career would be small since someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done them regardless, while the impact of donations would be large.|$|E
25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's father {{insists that}} Arthur {{has to get}} the play {{published}} so that Arthur, Dana, and their mother can profit immensely from it. He wants Arthur to claim the quarto was found by Sil in an attic in the 1950s, and to verify that nobody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a claim to the text (namely, the estates of the printer and publisher, William White and Cuthbert Burby). A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|E

500|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark {{frontman}} Andy McCluskey {{recalled a}} great many people [...] "who thought that the equipment wrote the song for you", and asserted: [...] "Believe me, if there was a button on a synth or a drum machine that said 'hit single', I would have pressed it as often as anybody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> – but there isn't. It was all written by real human beings, and it was all played by hand".|$|E
500|$|Prisoners on the master's side rarely {{ventured to}} the common side. John Baptist Grano went there just once, on 5 August 1728, writing in his diary: [...] "I thought it would have kill'd me." [...] There {{was no need for}} other prisoners to see it, John Ginger writes. It was enough that they knew it existed to keep the rental money, legal fees and other gratuities flowing from their families, fees that {{anywhere}} <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen them living in the lap of luxury, but which in the Marshalsea could be trusted merely to stave off disease and starvation.|$|E
500|$|Gore {{has said}} that his other reason for enlisting {{was that he did}} not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, {{recalled}} Gore saying that [...] "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go in his place". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, [...] "that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that [...] "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|However, manager Chris O'Donnell {{said the}} album was 75% live, with overdubs {{restricted}} to backing vocals and a few guitar solos to [...] "clean the sound up". Lynott {{said that there were}} a few necessary overdubs, but [...] "anything <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ruined the atmosphere on those recordings and made a mockery of putting out a live album". Robertson has been particularly critical over Visconti's view. He has said the album is almost all live, and the sound levels on stage would make overdubbing impossible {{due to the lack of}} acoustic separation between instruments. He claims a recording of [...] "Still In Love With You", featuring a guitar solo he felt was better than the one at the gig that was eventually released, could not be used due to phaser noise on the bass. From this, he concluded that if the bass could not be overdubbed, nothing else could either.|$|E
500|$|But after Fuller {{heard the}} demo, {{he felt it}} was wrong for S Club 7 and {{rejected}} it; English singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor also turned down the offer to record it. Davis then met with Minogue's A executive, Jamie Nelson. After hearing the demo cassette of the song, Nelson booked it for Minogue to record later that year. Nelson was impressed by the [...] "vibe" [...] of the song and felt it would please the [...] "danceheads." [...] Although Davis was initially under the impression that the recording deal would be called off later, Minogue became enthusiastic to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo. The whole song, including Minogue's vocals, were recorded at Davis's home studio in Surrey. The music, excluding the guitar part, was programmed using Korg Triton workstation via a MIDI. Dennis later remarked: [...] "Even though Kylie wasn't the first artist to be offered the song, I don't believe it was meant to go to anyone other than Kylie, and I don't believe anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done the incredible job she did with it, with the video, looking super-hot!" ...|$|E
500|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC {{operated}} {{a de facto}} ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering {{her to be a}} [...] "second-rater" [...] whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to [...] "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out [...] "mediocre material", noting that [...] "her capacity to do so amounts to genius... anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died of boredom long ago". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that [...] "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." [...] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the [...] "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" [...] associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from [...] "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books".|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contract}} {{allowed her}} to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking that nobody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her, she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was [...] "A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye," [...] which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not [...] "records" [...] per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason. This somewhat eased her [...] "stifled" [...] feeling.|$|E
2500|$|At trial Duško Vučković {{admitted}} {{he had been}} a member of the Serb Radical Party (SRS). He said that he joined the SRS because no one <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken him because of his mental health problems. [...] He had made plans to go to the frontline with SRS colleagues Zoran Dražilović, Ljubiša Petković and Zoran Rankić and received military training under supervision of Rankic and his brother. He had been arrested on 15 April 1992 after an incident in Zvornik but was released a few days later thanks to the efforts of the president of the SRS in Loznica and a lawyer hired by the party.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, two {{scenes from}} the first season of Breaking Bad were put under {{scrutiny}} in a Mythbusters Breaking Bad Special. Despite several modifications to what {{was seen in the}} show, both the scenes depicted in the show were shown to be physically impossible. In the [...] "Crazy Handful of Nothin'" [...] episode, Walt produces a batch of fulminated Mercury, ostensibly in crystalline form, and threatens to raze Tuco Salamanca's office to the ground. Although the compound is unstable, MythBusters has shown that Walt would have needed a much greater quantity of the compound along with a much faster throwing velocity, and that he and everyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died from the concussive blast.|$|E
2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Godric Gryffindor, {{one of the}} four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took off his hat, enchanted it, and let it choose. Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears [...] "patched and frayed and extremely dirty." [...] Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in Order of the Phoenix. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.|$|E

I, I shot the boy, killed him and it's—I'd like to think of it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed him in the end, but it wasn't right."
