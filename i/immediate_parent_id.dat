However, research suggests that they face {{an increased risk of}} having their children freed for adoption. Although parenting interventions {{have been found to be}} effective for <b>parents</b> with <b>ID,</b> such services are rarely offered. Research suggests that multiple factors impact upon child and family social workers decision making in this area, including personal experiences and attitudes. It was therefore thought that exploring social workers’ experiences of <b>parents</b> with <b>ID</b> might enable a greater understanding of why <b>parents</b> with <b>ID</b> face this increased risk. Interviews were carried out with seven child and family social workers who had experience of working on safeguarding cases where at least one <b>parent</b> had an <b>ID.</b> Data were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis and five super-ordinate themes were identified. These were: ‘feeling torn’ between parents and their children; experiencing a ‘power imbalance’ between themselves, parents and the local authority; feeling ‘hopeless’; having a sense of ‘pride’ in their work; and experiencing ‘barriers’. The results are discussed in the context of the increased risk <b>parents</b> with <b>ID</b> face of losing custody of their children.

Depending on the station network configuration and lead time at each station, some of the WIPI do not contribute to reducing the manufacturing lead time of the final product at all. Therefore, it is important to identify the optimal set of stations to hold WIPI such that the total inventory holding cost is minimized, while the required due date for the final product is met.

The advantages are significant in highly mobile scenarios such as intra-vehicular networks. However, mobile nodes in these networks suffer from long authentication delays, which adversely affect the goodput. In this work, we propose two techniques to shorten the initial authentication delay without compromising the authentication process and overall security. One of the techniques, called fast au-thentication, admits data traffic temporarily through the network to the gateway and the <b>immediate</b> <b>parent</b> node of the joining node presents network-side authentication. The other technique, called prefetch-assisted authentication, allows the authenticated wireless nodes to prefetch and store the authentication vectors of the potential mobile clients.

40|$|Background: Parents with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) are at {{risk for}} high levels of parenting stress. The present study evaluated resources, including parental adaptive functioning, financial resources and access to a support network, as moderators of the association between child behaviour problems and parenting stress. Method: A total of 134 <b>parents</b> with <b>ID</b> and their children (ages 1 - 7 years) were recruited from 10 Dutch care organisations. Questionnaires were administered to the parents to obtain information on parenting stress in the parent and child domain, financial resources and their support network. Teachers and care workers reported on child behaviour problems and parental adaptive functioning, respectively. Results: Parents experienced more stress with regard to their children than towards their own functioning and situation. Parenting stress was less in parents who were not experiencing financial hardship. Child behaviour problems were associated with high child-related parenting stress, not parent-related parenting stress. Large support networks decreased the association between child behaviour problems and child-related parenting stress. Financial resources did not significantly moderate the association. Conclusions: Parenting stress among <b>parents</b> with <b>ID</b> is focused on problems with the child, especially when little social support is available...|$|R
