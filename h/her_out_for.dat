5|$|In 1934, {{she began}} writing In a German Women's Prison, recounting her {{experience}} in jail with political prisoners and petty criminals. The French newspaper Le Monde published excerpts of the book, {{and it was}} soon translated and published in English, German, Russian, Spanish and Chinese, making her a celebrity. In the summer of 1934 the Soviet luminary Maxim Gorky invited her to attend the First Congress of Russian Writers, and reportedly singled <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise.

5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right hand as she was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the entire 2005 season.

Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E

25|$|Kallur {{suffered}} a stress fracture in September 2007 {{and missed the}} 2008 season. It had not healed by February 2008 and she opted for surgery, which eventually ruled <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the 2009 season as well. Her sister Susanna also had a similar injury, raising the suspicion {{that it may have}} been caused by their training programme. Kallur's injuries continued to persist and when a separate foot problem emerged in 2011 she decided to call an end to her athletics career at the age of thirty. Following her track career, she focused on training to be an advertising copywriter.|$|E
25|$|She faced strong {{competition}} on the European circuit: Jones took third at the London Grand Prix behind Sally McLellan and Perdita Felicien, and {{a run of}} 12.61seconds was only enough for third again at Herculis. She ran her second fastest time of the season (12.51) at the DN Galan meeting, but she was beaten to the line by Lopes-Schliep. She re-injured her hamstring at Weltklasse Zürich, ruling <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} season. Having missed the major championships and suffered injuries, the 2009 season was largely disappointing for Jones, although she took solace from having run the second fastest time that season.|$|E

25|$|In 1808 William Balfour {{replaced}} Balderston. He {{wrote to}} his uncle {{and some of his}} letters were later published. He described her as a leaky and that she should be taken out of service. He reported that the owners had hired <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 15s/month/ton (or £1795 per annum, based on a burthen of 195 tons). The owners also had agreed to provide 45 men at a rate of £5 10s each, per month. However, Balfour further reported that the owners were rarely able to provide half that many. At the time of writing, Cockatrice had a crew of 30 including Balfour and his servant. Lastly, Balfour reported that it was his understanding that Balderston had, in his 16 months in command, amassed some £2000 in prize money.|$|E
25|$|Playing {{her first}} clay tennis match {{in three years}} at the Andalucia Tennis Experience as the third seed, Clijsters {{advanced}} to the second round after beating Alexandra Dulgheru in three sets. However, in the second round, Clijsters lost to the world no. 258 Beatriz García Vidagany. Clijsters played in Belgium's Fed Cup tie against Estonia, easily defeating Maret Ani, 6–4, 6–2, in her opening singles match. However, {{it was discovered that}} she had torn a muscle in her left foot, causing her to pull out of her next match against Kaia Kanepi. Doctors ruled <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> six weeks, but Clijsters hoped to make an early recovery. She later announced in a press conference {{that she would have to}} withdraw from the rest of the clay-court season, including the French Open.|$|E
25|$|After her imprisonment, Bembenek filed three {{unsuccessful}} appeals of her conviction citing police {{errors in}} handling of key {{evidence and the}} fact that one of the prosecution's witnesses, Judy Zess, had recanted her testimony, stating it was made under duress. Bembenek and her supporters also alleged that Milwaukee police may have singled <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> prosecution because of her role as a key witness in a federal investigation into police corruption. Bembenek's supporters suggested that Fred Schultz may have arranged to have someone else murder his ex-wife. One possible candidate was Frederick Horenberger, a career criminal who briefly worked with Schultz on a remodeling project and was a former boyfriend of Judy Zess. A disguised Horenberger had robbed and beaten Judy Zess several weeks prior to Christine Schultz's murder and would later serve a ten-year sentence for that crime.|$|E

25|$|The 2001 season held {{significant}} career {{highs and}} lows for the athlete. She started the year by taking her third U.S. Indoor title in the long jump. She was chosen to compete at the 2001 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Lisbon, Portugal. Burrell gave the greatest performance of her career with a jump of 7.03m – her first time over the seven-meter mark. This was enough to win the gold medal some five centimeters ahead of the defending champion, Russian athlete Tatyana Kotova. The jump brought Burrell into the top ten long jumpers on the all-time indoor lists and made her the second best American indoors, behind Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She began preparing for the outdoor season, but suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury to her knee in April which ruled <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the entire season. The injury effectively ended her career as she competed sparingly thereafter but never again won a national title.|$|E

[...] The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the project.
