[...] If they refused, as often happened, the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted. [...] Hence the French expression [...] "se faire tirer l’oreille", of which the literal meaning is [...] "to have one's ear pulled" [...] and the <b>figurative</b> <b>meaning</b> [...] "to take a lot of persuading". We use the expression [...] "to tweak [...] (or pull) someone's ears" [...] to mean [...] "inflict a punishment"." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} English language uses of [...] "conscious" [...] and [...] "consciousness" [...] date back, however, to the 1500s. [...] The English word [...] "conscious" [...] originally {{derived from}} the Latin conscius (con- [...] "together" [...] and [...] "to know"), but the Latin word {{did not have the}} same meaning as our word—it meant [...] "knowing with", in other words [...] "having joint or common knowledge with another". [...] There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as [...] "knowing with oneself", or in other words [...] "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". [...] This phrase had the <b>figurative</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word [...] "conscious" [...] does. [...] In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word [...] "conscious" [...] retained the meaning of the Latin conscius. [...] For example, Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan wrote: [...] "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another." [...] The Latin phrase conscius sibi, whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as [...] "conscious to oneself" [...] or [...] "conscious unto oneself". [...] For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of [...] "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness". [...] Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.|$|E

2500|$|The related form of {{the verb}} [...] (mueó or myéō) appears in the New Testament. As {{explained}} in Strong's Concordance, it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its <b>figurative</b> <b>meaning</b> is to be initiated into the [...] "mystery revelation". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries.

[...] The term means [...] "anything hidden", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary.

40|$|As {{shown by}} {{research}} {{conducted in the}} fields of corpus linguistics, psycholinguistics and second language acquisition (SLA), formulaic sequences (e. g. collocations, idioms, phrasal verbs, lexical bundles etc.) form a crucial part of second language learners’ language competence. One of the main characteristics of some of these multi-word combinations is their idiomatic nature and idioms have been widely researched as being the most compositional type. However, little is known whether collocations can be idiomatic too. Therefore, this thesis aims to fill that gap with a specific focus on statistically-derived collocations. Three studies have been carried out to this end. The first study examined the extent of collocations whose meanings were the sums of their component parts, those that were figurative (compositional or idiomatic) and finally, collocations that were polysemous, i. e. had both literal and <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings.</b> A corpus search was performed to find the most common V+N and Adj+N combinations and results showed that the majority of them had additive meanings (as reflected in traditional definitions of collocations), very few were completely opaque and a substantial percentage were those that allowed both literal and figurative interpretation. The second study was conducted in the Chilean classroom context and it focused on the knowledge of the <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings</b> of collocations. A meaning-recall test was used as a measurement instrument and variables such as corpus frequency, semantic transparency and language use factors were manipulated. The findings demonstrated rather weak figurative knowledge and a positive relationship between this knowledge and the amount of outside engagement. The last study investigated the same type of collocations, namely how non-native speakers acquired <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings</b> incidentally through reading. An authentic novel was used as a means to manipulate one single variable, frequency of exposure. Results showed that the <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings</b> could be acquired incidentally from reading and that the point at which a substantial amount of learning occurred varied greatly among individuals. Overall, results of the studies presented in this thesis stress the importance of researching the acquisition, use and knowledge of collocations with <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings</b> as they have important implications for instructed SLA...|$|R

6000|$|The doctors of self-love are {{misled by}} a wrong {{use of the}} words,--"We love ourselves!" [...] Now this is {{impossible}} for a finite and created being in the absolute meaning of self; and in its secondary and <b>figurative</b> <b>meaning,</b> self signifies only a less degree of distance, a narrowness of moral view, and a determination of value by measurement. Hence the body is in this sense our self, because the sensations have been habitually appropriated to it in too great a proportion; {{but this is not}} a necessity of our nature. There is a state possible even in this life, in which we may truly say, [...] "My self loves,"--freely constituting its secondary or objective love in what it wills to love, commands what it wills, and wills what it commands. The difference between self-love, and self that loves, consists in the objects of the former as given to it according to the law of the senses, while the latter determines the objects according to the law in the spirit. The first loves because it must; the second, because it ought; and the result of the first is not in any objective, imaginable, comprehensible, action, but in that action by which it abandoned its power of true agency, and willed its own fall. This is, indeed, a mystery. How can it be otherwise?--For if the will be unconditional, it must be inexplicable, the understanding of a thing being an insight into its conditions and causes. But whatever is in the will is the will, and must therefore be equally inexplicable.|$|E

The first page should contain the Epistle of St. Jerome to the reader. It will be observed that there is nothing of the nature of a title-page, but I have often seen title-pages supplied by some ignorant imitator in the last century, with the idea that the book was imperfect without one. The books of the Bible follow in order--but the order not only differs from ours, but differs in different copies. The Apocryphal books are always included. The New Testament usually follows on the Old without any break; and the book concludes with an index of the Hebrew names and their signification in Latin, intended to help preachers to the <b>figurative</b> <b>meaning</b> of the biblical types and parables. The last line of the Bible itself usually contains a colophon, in which sometimes the name of the writer is given, sometimes the length of time it has taken him to write, and sometimes merely the [...] "Explicit. Laus Deo," [...] which has found its way into many modern books. This colophon, which comes as a rule immediately before the index, often contains curious notes, hexameters giving the names of all the books, biographical or local memoranda, and should always be looked for by the collector. One such line occurs to me. It is in a Bible written in Italy in the thirteenth century - ...|$|E

While a dichotomous distinction between literal and figurative language is difficult to maintain, we suggest that the notion of coded meaning is a useful one, and argue that coded meanings {{play an important role in}} the construction of conceptual integration networks for literal and <b>figurative</b> <b>meanings</b> alike. In addition, we explore various notions of context as it pertains to literal and figurative interpretation of language, focusing on Langacker's concept of ground.
