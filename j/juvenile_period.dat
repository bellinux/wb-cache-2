5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The <b>juvenile</b> <b>period</b> for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

40|$|UA Open Access Publishing FundWhich factors select {{for long}} <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods</b> in some species {{is not well}} understood. One {{potential}} reason to delay the onset of reproduction is slow food acquisition rates, either due to competition (part of the ecological risk avoidance hypothesis), or due to a decreased foraging efficiency (a version of the needing to learn hypothesis). Capuchins provide a useful genus to test the needing to learn hypothesis because they are known for having long <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods</b> and a difficult-to-acquire diet. Generalized, linear, mixed models with data from 609 fruit forage focal follows on 49, habituated, wild Cebus capucinus were used to test two predictions from the needing-to-learn hypothesis {{as it applies to}} fruit foraging skills: 1) capuchin monkeys do not achieve adult foraging return rates for difficult-to-acquire fruits before late in the juvenile period; and 2) variance in return rates for these fruits is at least partially associated with differences in foraging skill. In support of the first prediction, adults, compared with all younger age classes, had significantly higher foraging return rates when foraging for fruits that were ranked as difficult-to-acquire (return rates relative to adults: 0. 30 – 0. 41, p-value range 0. 008 – 0. 016), indicating that the individuals in the group who have the most foraging experience also achieve the highest return rates. In contrast, and in support of the second prediction, {{there were no significant differences}} between age classes for fruits that were ranked as easy to acquire (return rates relative to adults: 0. 97 – 1. 42, p-value range 0. 086 – 0. 896), indicating that strength and/or skill are likely to affect return rates. In addition, fruits that were difficult to acquire were foraged at nearly identical rates by adult males and significantly smaller (and presumably weaker) adult females (males relative to females: 1. 01, p = 0. 978), while subadult females had much lower foraging efficiency than the similarly-sized but more experienced adult females (subadults relative to adults: 0. 34, p = 0. 052), indicating that skill, specifically, is likely to have an effect on return rates. These results are consistent with the needing to learn hypothesis and indicate that long <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods</b> in capuchins may be the result of selection for more time to learn foraging skills for difficult-to-acquire fruits...|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} was to simplify the ALLINT column to three classifications: short (≤ 5 yr), {{moderate}} (6 yr to 9 yr), and long (≥ 10 yr) fire return intervals. The number of classifications and the range they encompass can all be dictated by the user, though our method allows for a maximum of ten as we use single numbers (0 to 9) for the classifications. For example, very short and very long intervals could be included. To define our short fire return intervals, we investigated <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods</b> of floristic taxa (Burrows et al. 2008), and to define our long return intervals, we investigated the time-since-fire at which fuels will carry an intense fire under normal (not extreme) weather conditions (Gould et al. 2007).|$|R
500|$|Cabbage is {{generally}} grown for its densely leaved heads, produced {{during the first}} year of its biennial cycle. Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves. Temperatures between [...] prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the <b>juvenile</b> <b>period.</b> The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about [...] Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.|$|E
500|$|The {{species is}} a {{prolific}} flowerer, and this, {{combined with the}} very high outcrossing rates, results in massive seed output. In one study, {{the average number of}} seeds produced per B.sessilis plant was 622, compared with an average of 2 for B.dallanneyi. This exceptionally high fecundity can be understood as an adaption to regular bushfire. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark; reseeders are killed by fire, but populations are rapidly re-established through the recruitment of seedlings. B.sessilis is a reseeder, but it differs from many other reseeders in not being strongly serotinous: the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in autumn, {{even in the absence of}} fire. The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in the scientific literature: it has been treated as [...] "serotinous", [...] "weakly serotinous" [...] and [...] "non-serotinous". Regardless of the terminology used, the massive spontaneous seed output of B.sessilis is its primary survival strategy, and is so effective that the species has a reputation as an excellent coloniser. However, this strategy, together with its relatively long <b>juvenile</b> <b>period,</b> makes it vulnerable to overly frequent fire.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{breeding}} of temperate fruit trees is constrained by their extensive reproductive cycle with long <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods,</b> complex reproductive biology, and {{high degree of}} heterozygosity. As the commercial production of transgenic annual crops becomes a reality {{in many parts of}} the world, the question remains whether genetically engineering fruit trees will find commercial application. Gene transfer for fruit tree improvement has several inherent advantages. Once a useful transformant is isolated, vegetative propagation, which is the normal method of multiplying fruit trees, provides unlimited production of the desired transgenic line. Fixation through the sexual cycle is unnecessary and inconvenient if commercially-accepted cultivars are transformed. Since production of most fruit tree species is based on a few cultivars, the impact of transforming one of them would be significant.

40|$|The human larynx descends during infancy and {{the early}} <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods,</b> and this greatly {{contributes}} to the morphological foundations of speech development. This developmental phenomenon {{is believed to be}} unique to humans. This concept has formed a basis for paleoanthropological studies on the origin and evolution of human speech. We used magnetic resonance imaging to study the development of three living chimpanzees and found that their larynges also descend during infancy, as in human infants. This descent was completed primarily through the rapid descent of the laryngeal skeleton relative to the hyoid, but it was not accompanied by the descent of the hyoid itself. The descent is possibly associated with developmental changes of the swallowing mechanism. Moreover, it contributes physically to an increased independence between the processes of phonation and articulation for vocalization. Thus, the descent of the larynx and the morphological foundations for speech production must have evolved in part during hominoid evolution, and not in a single shift during hominid evolution...|$|R
40|$|Dietary niches have {{widespread}} {{effects on}} individuals’ life histories, behaviors, and morphologies. Capuchin monkeys inhabit a complex dietary niche that often entails hunting of relatively large vertebrate prey, tool-use, and extraction of embedded resources that other closely related and sympatric species do not exploit. In this dissertation I examine, a) how juvenile capuchins overcome {{the challenges of}} reliance on a difficult-to-acquire diet, b) at what age juveniles achieve maximum foraging return rates for difficult-to-acquire foods, and c) what nutritional benefits capuchins obtain from exploitation of these foods. In the process of addressing these questions I test two prominent hypotheses regarding reliance on a difficult-to-acquire diet. First, I test two predictions form the food scarcity/difficulty hypothesis which posits that species who rely more heavily on foods that are either rare or difficult to acquire should exhibit higher rates of food transfers, because juveniles in these species face greater foraging challenges. Second, I test two predictions from the ecological complexity hypothesis which proposes that species that rely on more difficult-to-acquire foods require longer <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods,</b> {{in order to learn}} the skills necessary to exploit these foods. Foraging return rates and rates of food transfers were calculated for individuals in three groups of wild capuchin monkeys inhabiting the Pacuare Nature Reserve in Costa Rica. Foraging return rates were measured in terms of bites ingested per forage time. In addition, food items were analyzed for nutritional content which enabled calculations of nutrient return rates. The major results include: 1) food transfer rates were highest in infants, and food items that were more difficult to acquire and had more nonstructural carbohydrates were transferred more frequently; 2) juvenile foraging strategies for difficult-to-acquire foods can be distinguished from adult strategies; 3) maximum foraging efficiency was not achieved until well into adulthood for difficult-to-acquire fruits. These findings support the food difficulty hypothesis regarding food transfers and the ecological complexity hypothesis regarding long <b>juvenile</b> <b>periods.</b> A final goal for this study was to evaluate the benefits of foraging for difficult-to-acquire foods. Results imply the most likely benefit accrued from difficult-to-acquire foods is as a source of fallback nutrients. AnthropologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

The incursion of most exotic species to Japan has been historically recent. The lack of quarantine for plants (apart from parasitic plants and plants infected with disease) coupled with large importations of wheat and soybeans from north America and contaminated grain and fodder for farm animals has led to an exponential rate of plant invasion in Japan.
