However, more complex tools require multiple steps from the programmed robot. For instance, some complex tools can have multiple conventional side pulls that mate with the core to add rigidity to the core and reduce the core mass. After the core is loaded and the press closed the plastic is shot.|$|E

500|$|According to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, Naylor {{makes the}} {{statement}} that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: [...] Naylor believes {{that there is much}} [...] "gray area between right and wrong". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times-Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that [...] "nothing <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as it seems". Entertainment Weekly Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that Shiloh is a [...] "strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life".|$|E
500|$|Its plot {{received}} mixed reviews. GameTrailers {{said that}} God of War IIIs storyline makes Greek mythology more interesting. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw {{said it had}} an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. According to Donlan, the story <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as it can get. McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it [...] "becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale." [...] Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot [...] "doesn't have any standout revelations or developments".|$|E

500|$|The redshifts {{of galaxies}} include both a {{component}} related to recessional velocity from {{expansion of the}} Universe, and a component related to peculiar motion (Doppler shift). The redshift due to expansion of the Universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe {{the expansion of the}} Universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said, [...] "Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as that..." [...] Steven Weinberg clarified, [...] "The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of [...] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of [...] in the whole period from emission to absorption." ...|$|E

2500|$|Behavior-based {{treatment}} options {{can be useful}} for developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals with pica. These may involve using positive reinforcement normal behavior. Many use aversion therapy, where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often treatment {{is similar to the}} treatment of obsessive compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases treatment <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it. A recent study classified nine such classes of behavioral intervention: [...] Success with treatment is generally high and generally fades with age, but it varies depending on the cause of the disorder.
