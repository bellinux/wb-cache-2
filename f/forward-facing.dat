5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large <b>forward-facing</b> eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a {{conspicuous}} circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{typical owls}} are small to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large <b>forward-facing</b> eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a {{conspicuous}} circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk. One species {{has been recorded}} in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Typical owls {{are small}} to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large <b>forward-facing</b> eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak and a {{conspicuous}} circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disc. There are about 199 species worldwide, with four recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Typical owls {{are small}} to large solitary nocturnal birds of prey. They have large <b>forward-facing</b> eyes and ears, a hawk-like beak, and a {{conspicuous}} circle of feathers around each eye called a facial disk. Eight {{species have been}} recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units, each featuring one <b>forward-facing</b> low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, K5054, {{was fitted}} with ejector type exhausts. Later {{marks of the}} Spitfire used a {{variation}} of this exhaust system fitted with <b>forward-facing</b> intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three <b>forward-facing</b> weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are <b>forward-facing,</b> which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way that}} facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The <b>forward-facing</b> reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E
5|$|The rider's {{experience}} {{is dependent upon}} the location of her or his seat on the train. Screens are located {{on both sides of}} the track but the only continuous screen on the track is on the right-hand side. The train makes several tight turns during the ride; riders facing forward experience all the animations while riders facing backward miss some scenes because of the lack of screen space. The cars rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face the screens; <b>forward-facing</b> riders rotate toward the continuous screen.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (<b>forward-facing)</b> lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give <b>forward-facing</b> firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it would be sufficient in the night fighter role, which is where they intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the highly specialized toothcomb, an arrangement of four or six long, <b>forward-facing</b> teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like teeth on a comb. Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated a mat of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had <b>forward-facing</b> eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to <b>forward-facing</b> surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a <b>forward-facing</b> surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might be {{representative}} of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and the giraffe in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and the T. obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of pathologic old males. His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, <b>forward-facing</b> horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a helmet. The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as {{the inspiration for the}} university's vision. The chief of the shield bears an open book, a common symbol of learning, with a maple leaf on each side, signifying that McMaster's charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. The helmet, above the shield, has the open visor and <b>forward-facing</b> style typically used by universities. The mantling surrounding the shield and helmet represents the cloak worn over a knight's armour as protection from the sun. The crest, located above the helmet, is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian Senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias. The motto is located above the crest, as is common in Scottish heraldry.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and <b>forward-facing</b> eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as <b>forward-facing</b> as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E
25|$|HW2 {{includes}} eight {{cameras and}} twelve ultrasonic sensors, {{in addition to}} <b>forward-facing</b> radar.|$|E
25|$|The other twenty-two {{figures have}} their {{profiles}} turned to Moses, {{which is the}} only <b>forward-facing</b> bas-relief.|$|E
25|$|In California, {{emergency}} vehicles must display {{at least one}} <b>forward-facing</b> steady-burn red light. Some exceptions are occasionally made for individual vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Updated {{version of}} the TBM 850, {{including}} four cabin seats in a <b>forward-facing</b> configuration, allowing for an increased cargo area aft of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|The {{point of}} impact is usually any <b>forward-facing</b> edge of the vehicle such as a wing leading edge, nose cone, jet engine cowling or engine inlet.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species are}} capable of {{spraying}} their venom from <b>forward-facing</b> holes at the tips of their fangs using pressure, and this {{can act as a}} means of defense.|$|E
25|$|This seating arrangement, while {{accepted}} on the TranzAlpine, Coastal Pacific, and Bay Expresses, proved unsuccessful on the Southerner, so one {{car from}} each set had seating re-arranged to a <b>forward-facing</b> layout.|$|E
25|$|Red The Swedish police use a <b>forward-facing</b> {{red light}} to {{indicate}} that a driver must pull over and stop. Fire vehicles use a red light to designate the command post.|$|E
25|$|A near {{universal}} {{exception to}} this rule is school buses which are allowed to use rear and <b>forward-facing,</b> usually alternatively phased flashing red lights just before, during, and after passenger loading & unloading as a signal for all other traffic to stop.|$|E
25|$|Small {{technical}} {{changes have}} been made {{in order for them to}} be used in the area. These include <b>forward-facing</b> CCTV and saloon CCTV installation and electronic LED destination displays and automatic GPS based announcing system (as per the Class 321/9 units).|$|E
25|$|Steady {{checkered}} lights denote {{command and}} control vehicles - these are red and white for fire (one of the few situations where a <b>forward-facing</b> red light may be shown), blue and white for police and green and white for ambulance, and are often fitted {{in the middle of}} the light bar.|$|E
25|$|It was {{anticipated}} that Irish forces would resist the initial invasion. Landing craft and vessels transporting the German troops {{were to be}} equipped with <b>forward-facing</b> guns, and invading troops were instructed to assume defensive positions {{as soon as they}} came under fire, considering retreat only in the most dire emergency.|$|E
25|$|Brendan McMonigal, Geraint F. Lewis, and Philip O'Byrne {{have argued}} that when an Alcubierre-driven ship decelerates from superluminal speed, the {{particles}} that its bubble has gathered in transit would be released in energetic outbursts akin to a sonic boom shockwave; {{in the case of}} <b>forward-facing</b> particles, energetic enough to destroy anything at the destination {{directly in front of the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, captains {{operating}} ships in icebound waters discovered that {{sometimes it was}} easier to break through ice by running their vessels astern. Although not known at the time, this was because the <b>forward-facing</b> propellers generated a lubricating water flow that lowered the ice resistance by reducing friction between the ship's hull and ice. However, as the steering ability of a ship is greatly reduced when running astern, it could not be considered a main operating mode. These findings resulted in the adoption of bow propellers in older icebreakers operating in the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, but in the more severe Arctic ice conditions they could not be used because the risk of the bow propellers being damaged by multi-year ice floes was too great. Furthermore, <b>forward-facing</b> propellers have a very low propulsion efficiency and they considerably increase the ship's open water resistance, making them unsuitable for merchant ships.|$|E
