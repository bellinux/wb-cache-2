50|$|A closed soft {{seated valve}} {{is much less}} liable to leak when shut while hard seated valves are more durable. Gate, globe, and check valves are usually hard seated while butterfly, ball, plug, and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> are usually soft seated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> (or {{membrane}} valves) {{consists of}} a valve body with two or more ports, a diaphragm, and a [...] "weir or saddle" [...] or seat upon which the diaphragm closes the valve. The valve is constructed from either plastic or metal.|$|E
50|$|Diaphragm valve: A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> {{is used in}} {{pneumatic}} cannons {{where the}} barrel is within the air chamber. It is a disk of flexible material mounted directly behind the barrel that seals it when pressure is increased behind the disk. The design is such that air leaks past the diaphragm from behind it to the chamber around the barrel, sealing the soft rubber against {{the butt of the}} barrel. Once the chamber is fully pressurised the compressed air behind the diaphragm is quickly vented, causing the centre of the diaphragm to flex backwards, exposing the butt of the barrel to the compressed air inside the chamber, which rapidly exhausts through the barrel, launching the projectile. Sprinkler valves have also been modified to act in the same manner a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> operates; changing the triggering of the valve to a release of air controlled by a blowgun valve, rather than electronically.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of diaphragm valves: one type seals over a [...] "weir" [...] (saddle) and the other (sometimes called a [...] "full bore or straight-way" [...] valve) seals over a seat. The weir or saddle type {{is the most common}} in process applications and the seat-type is more commonly used in slurry applications to reduce blocking issues but exists also as a process valve. While <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> usually come in two-port forms (2/2-way diaphragm valve), they can also come with three ports (3/2-way <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> also called T-valves) and more (so called block-valves). When more than three ports are included, they generally require more than one diaphragm seat; however, special dual actuators can handle more ports with one membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> can be manual or automated.

When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of controllers, {{electric}} and hydraulic. Most automatic irrigation valves are <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> in which the water above the diaphragm must be discharged for the valve to open.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a method for fabricating a microfluidic device with integrated large-scale all-glass valves and constructed an actuator system to control each of the valves on the device. Such a microfluidic device has advantages that allow its use in various fields, including physical, chemical, and biochemical analyses and syntheses. However, it is inefficient and difficult to integrate the large-scale all-glass valves in a microfluidic device using conventional glass fabrication methods, especially for the through-hole fabrication step. Therefore, we have developed a fabrication method for the large-scale integration of all-glass valves in a microfluidic device that contains 110 individually controllable <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> units on a 30 mm × 70 mm glass slide. This prototype device was fabricated by first sandwiching a 0. 4 -mm-thick glass slide that contained 110 1. 5 -mm-diameter shallow chambers, each with two 50 -μm-diameter through-holes, between an ultra-thin glass sheet (4 μm thick) and another 0. 7 -mm-thick glass slide that contained etched channels. After the fusion bonding of these three layers, the large-scale microfluidic device was obtained with integrated all-glass valves consisting of 110 individual <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> units. We demonstrated its use as a pump capable of generating a flow rate of approximately 0. 06 – 5. 33 μL/min. The maximum frequency of flow switching was approximately 12 Hz...|$|R

50|$|Piston valve: The gold {{standard}} of pneumatic spudgunning is the piston valve, {{due to its}} extremely high rate of flow and opening speed. It works in an almost identical fashion to a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> but replaces the flexible diaphragm with a hard rubber-faced piston. The valve opening is generally as wide as or wider than the barrel diameter, so {{there is very little}} constriction of airflow. Piston valves also open much faster than either ball or solenoid valves. However, construction of this type of valve is inherently complex, and some choose to order pre-built valves through the internet.|$|R
40|$|Recent work on fully opened rubber-lined <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> {{showed that}} {{due to the lack}} of {{geometric}} similarity, dynamic similarity could not be established. The laminar flow loss coefficient constant therefore becomes diameter dependent as is the case of turbulent flow loss coefficients. The purpose of this work was to establish if this is the case for all types of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves,</b> by testing <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> from a different manufacturer. Accurate loss coefficient data is critical for energy efficient hydraulic design. Saunders type straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> ranging from 40. mm to 100. mm were tested in the fully open, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % open positions, using a range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. It was found that the laminar flow loss coefficient constant suggested by Hooper (1981) is sufficient for all valve diameters at Reynolds numbers below 10. However, for transitional and turbulent flow the same loss coefficients cannot be applied for more accurate designs for <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> from different manufacturers.

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} use of straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> in many diverse industrial applications, very few studies of frictional pressure loss for straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> {{have been reported in}} the open literature. The few that are available are for fully opened valves based on the tacit assumption that different sized <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> are geometrically similar. In this study, the pressure drops across five straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> were measured in four aperture positions. Resistance coefficients were determined by experimentally establishing pressure gradients upstream and downstream of the valves. The experiments were carried out using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids over a wide range of Reynolds numbers with the emphasis on obtaining laminar flow data. The Hooper 2 -k correlation was corroborated and found to be valid at Reynolds numbers < 10 for straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> At higher Reynolds numbers the resistance coefficient is shown to be dependent on the size and the opening of the valve. Three different approaches (domain separation, simple summation, and selective combination) using a two-constant model to predict the experimental resistance coefficients were explored. Comparison of the correlations with experimental data and existing models has shown that the simple summation two-constant model approach has substantial merit. Considering the complexities of accounting for the valve size, the valve opening position, the type of fluid over a Reynolds number range of 0. 1 - 100 000, this model gives pipeline design engineers a simple, semi-empirical correlation for the estimation of resistance coefficients of straight-through diaphragm control valves...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{requirements for}} the degree Master Technology: Chemical Engineering in the FACULTY OF ENGINEERING at the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 2009 The prediction of the energy losses when designing pipeline and pumping systems requires accurate loss coefficient data. But the loss coefficient data found in the open literature was not adequate for predicting the loss coefficient for Saunders straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> As more accurate loss coefficient data to enable more efficient pipeline designs are scarce in the open literature, it is problematic to predict the head loss due to the pipeline fittings, and particularly for <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> Most of the data given in the literature are for turbulent flow based on water. Due to water shortages mining operations are forced to increase their solids concentrations and to operate in laminar flow (Slatter, 2002). Consequently {{there is a need}} to determine loss coefficient data in laminar flow for valves used in these industries to ensure energy efficient designs (Pienaar et al., 2001; 2004) or if needed, to derive a new correlation to predict losses through Saunders <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> However, a systematic study of various sizes of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> of different manufacturers to ascertain, if the same loss coefficient can be applied, has never been done. Therefore a comparison will be made between the data produced in this work and the existing correlations. The objective of this research was to determine loss coefficient data in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow for the Saunders type straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> ranging from 40 mm to 100 mm in the fully open, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % open positions, using a range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

These complicated components can be machined by employing NC machine tools. TIle motion commands for NC machine tool {{are determined by the}} path of the cutter. Obtaining optimal cutter path length is vital important in reducing the machining time.

Hence, this project has presented the development of the process planning for machining <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valve</b> with Y - valve body (prismatic parts) with regard an optimum machining time. An effective process planning was developed with considering two major influences over machining time which are cutter path and machining operation sequence.

The machining operation is assumed to be carried out by 3 -axis CNC vertical milling machine and has five setups for machining completion. The process planning developed comprises of six phases. They are fcature recognition, machining operation selection, machine selection, cutting tool sclection, cutting parameters selection and finally sequencing of the machining operation.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{prediction}} of head losses in a pipe system {{is very important}} because head losses affect the performance of fluid machinery such as pumps. In a pipe system, two kinds of losses are observed: major losses and minor losses. In Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow, major losses {{are those that are}} due to friction in straight pipes and minor losses are those that are due to pipe fittings such as contractions, expansions, bends and valves. Minor losses must be accurately predicted in a pipe system because they are not negligible and can sometimes outweigh major losses (Edwards et al., 1985). There is presently little data for the {{prediction of}} non-Newtonian head losses in pipe fittings in the literature and little consensus amongst researchers (Pienaar et al., 2004). In the case of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves,</b> usually, only one loss coefficient value is given in turbulent flow or in laminar flow with no reference to a specific size of the valve, assuming geometrical similarity that would lead to dynamic similarity. However, no one has done a systematic study of various sizes of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> from the same manufacturer to establish if this is true. This could be the main reason for discrepancies found in the literature (Hooper, 1981; Perry & Chilton, 1973; Miller, 1978 and Pienaar et al., 2004). This work addresses this issue. A literature revIew on the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids has been presented. The work of Hooper (1981) on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> and the works of Edwards et al., (1985), BaneIjee et aI., (1994) and Turian et al., (1997) for non-Newtonian fluids in globe and gate valves were found to be relevant to this work...|$|E
40|$|There is a world-wide {{emphasis}} on energy reducing technologies. Accounting accurately for the losses {{that arise from}} pipe fittings, such as valves, can result in cost and energy savings. Efficient designs, using (for example) correctly sized pumps, are only possible if reliable loss coefficient data are available. There are currently limited loss coefficient data available for predicting pressure losses in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> for Newtonian fluids, and even fewer for non-Newtonian fluids. This is an urgent industrial problem, {{as the use of}} these valves is widespread in the mineral processing industries and consequent oversizing of pumps is common practice. In this paper, pressure losses were therefore measured for five Natco rubber-lined, straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> of diameters ranging from 40 mm to 100 mm, using both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids for Reynolds numbers spanning laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. The measurements have confirmed that the diameter does affect the loss coefficient. Geometric - and therefore dynamic - similarity does not exist for these valves. This is contrary to the data found in the literature where only one value is provided, with no indication of the valve diameter. It was shown that the non-Newtonian behaviour can be accounted for by using the appropriate Reynolds number. Empirical correlations were derived to calculate the loss coefficient for each valve for laminar, transitional and turbulent flow. In conclusion, the laminar flow loss coefficient constant provided by Hooper (1981) was confirmed and can be used for conservative designs. Accurate design, however, demands that the actual valve data should be used...|$|E

A wide variety of valves are used throughout the industrial world, but those used for semiconductor manufacturing require special features such as external leak-free, particle-free and dead space-free, because the extremely fine patterns formed on the high grade wafers are made with ultrapure process gases.
