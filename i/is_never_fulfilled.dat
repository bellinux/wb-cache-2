2500|$|At {{the next}} {{shot of the}} battle, the White Witch has exited her chariot and is walking. She has petrified a satyr and pushes its petrified form to the ground. Then two gryphons attack her, but she wounds the first gryphon by cutting its wing and kills the other by turning it into stone in mid-flight, sending it to crash into the ground with some of its debris hitting the soldiers. At the sight of this, Peter warns Edmund to leave the battle quoting [...] "get the girls, and get them home." [...] But Edmund sees the Witch petrifying a faun and a jaguar as she is {{approaching}} Peter, intending to petrify him to ensure the prophecy <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> Edmund brings out his sword as Mr. Beaver tries to pull Edmund away saying [...] "Peter said get out of here!" [...] Edmund escapes saying [...] "Peter's not king yet" [...] and he runs to duel the Witch. Edmund is then pursued by two minotaurs. Fauns distract the first one while a gorilla intercepts the other minotaur making the road clear for Edmund. Along the way, Ginarrbrik is overwhelming {{and is about to}} kill a Red Dwarf, but Edmund wounds him by pushing him off the cliff. Edmund is about to face the White Witch, who was still on her way to petrify Peter. He manages to break her wand in half, making it useless as means of petrification. However, she disarms him and plunges the sharp end into his stomach, leaving him to fall to the ground, mortally wounded. Peter sees this and runs to fight the Witch face-to-face.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} "Cosmos Project" {{observation}} of dark-matter concentrations with no ordinary matter in the same place, we study {{the question of the}} existence of compact objects made of pure dark matter. We assume that the dark matter is neutralino, and compare its elastic and annihilation cross sections. We find that the two cross sections are of the same order of magnitude. This result has a straightforward and important consequence that neutralinos comprising a compact object can not achieve thermal equilibrium. To substantiate our arguments, by solving Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation we constructed a model of the star made of pure neutralinos. We explicitly showed that the condition for the thermal equilibrium supported by the Fermi pressure <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>fulfilled</b> inside the star. This neutralino state can not be described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Thus, a stable neutralino star, which is supported by the Fermi pressure, can not exist. We also estimated that a stable star can not contain more than a few percents of neutralinos, most of the mass must be {{in the form of the}} standard model particles.

40|$|The {{study and}} control of the {{locomotion}} of a biped robot has always been a challenging problem. The mechanical complexity of biped robots, the existence of an unpowered degree of freedom, and the peculiarity of their motion due to the repeatability of movements and a permanent change of situations during one step, synthesize a complex problem. At the same time, undesired collisions with its environment, transport of unknown loads, or simplification of some dynamic characteristics, cause uncertainty (structured or not) which makes worse the control problem since an accurate model of the biped robot is not available. In this paper a nine link planar biped model is studied. It is a biped robot that includes not only the main links: legs, thighs and trunk, but also a two segments foot. For this biped robot, the kinematic and dynamic equations which describe completely the locomotion of the robot during the different phases of walking, are defined. Furthermore, a continuous walking pattern on a flat terrain is designed and the corresponding desired trajectories of the robot joints are calculated. Then, a nonlinear robust control technique is adopted, {{based on the fact that}} the control which has to ensure the stability of the biped robot must take into account the nonlinear dynamics of the system. This requires the knowledge of an accurate model of the biped robot, a condition that <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>fulfilled</b> because of the existence of disturbances and modelling inaccuracies such as parametric uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. Thus, for the case there is not available a priori information about the unknown parameters, the parametric uncertainty has to be gradually reduced on-line by an adaptation or estimation mechanism. Here, rapidly time-varying unknown parameters are assumed, and a kind of robust-adaptive controller is designed which achieves robustness in the face of such modelling imprecisions, while at the same time ensures that all signals in the closed-loop robot system are bounded and the tracking error is of the order of the parameter variations. Extensive simulation experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed robust-adaptive control scheme...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on fatigue crack growth {{experiments}} and assessments of fatigue crack growth rates. Both constant and variable amplitude loads {{in two different}} materials are considered; a nickel based super-alloy Inconel 718 and a stainless steel 316 L. The considered load levels extend from small scale yielding (SSY) to large scale yielding (LSY) for both materials. The effect of different load schemes on the fatigue crack growth rates is investigated on Inconel 718 and compact tension specimens in Paper A. It is concluded that load decreasing schemes give a to high Paris law exponent compared to constant or increasing load amplitude schemes. Inconel 718 is further analyzed in Paper B where growth rates at variable amplitude loading in notched tensile specimens are assessed. The predictions {{are based on the}} fatigue crack growth parameters obtained in Paper A. The crack closure levels are taken into consideration and it is concluded that linear elastic fracture mechanics is incapable of predicting the growth rates in notches that experience large plastic cyclic strains. Even if crack closure free fatigue parameters are used and residual stresses due to plasticity are included. It is also concluded that crack closure free and nominal fatigue crack growth data predict the growth rates equally well. However, if the crack closure free parameters are used, then it is possible to make a statement in advance on the prediction in relation to the experimental outcome. This is not possible with nominal fatigue crack growth parameters. The last three papers consider fatigue crack growth in stainless steel 316 L. Here the load is defined as the crack tip opening displacement parameter. Paper C constitutes an investigation on the effect of plastic deformation on the potential drop and consequently the measured crack length. It is concluded that the nominal calibration equation obtained in the undeformed geometry can be used at large plastic deformations. However, two conditions must be met: the reference potential must be taken in the deformed geometry and the reference potential needs to be adjusted at every major change of plastic deformation. The potential drop technique is further used in Paper D and Paper E for crack length measurements at monotonic LSY. Constant amplitude loads are considered in Paper D and two different variable amplitude block loads are investigated in Paper E. The crack tip opening displacement is concluded in Paper D to be an objective parameter able to characterize the load state in two different geometries and at the present load levels. Furthermore, if the crack tip opening displacement is controlled in an experiment and the local load ratio set to zero, then only monotonic LSY will appear due to extensive isotropic hardening, i. e. elastic shake-down. This is also the reason why the linear elastic stress-intensity factor successfully could merge all growth rates, extending from SSY to monotonic LSY along a single line in a Paris law type of diagram, even though the generally accepted criteria for SSY <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> For the variable amplitude loads investigated in Paper E, the effect of plastic deformation on measured potential drop is more pronounced. However, also here both the crack tip opening displacement parameter and the linear elastic stress-intensity factor successfully characterized the load state. QC 20130108 </p...|$|E
