40|$|Network users {{today have}} to {{remember}} one username/password pair for every service they are registered with. One solution to the security and usability implications of this situation is Single Sign-On, a mechanism by which the user authenticates only once to an entity termed the `Authentication Service Provider' (ASP) and subsequently uses disparate Service Providers (SPs) without necessarily re-authenticating. The information about the user's authentication status is handled between the ASP and the desired SP in a manner transparent to the user. This paper demonstrates a method by which the <b>end-user's</b> <b>computing</b> platform itself {{plays the role of}} the ASP.

30|$|The TAM is a {{theoretically}} justified and parsimonious {{model that}} makes a good ground theory for studying usersâ€™ beliefs in using LMS technologies (De Smet et al. 2012). The model is capable of explaining behaviour across {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>end-users</b> <b>computing</b> technologies with two key determinants that serve as motivation for technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (Davis 1989). Perceived usefulness describes the belief that using a particular technology will improve job performance, while perceived ease of use refers to the belief that using a target technology will be free of effort (Davis 1989). Teachers will most likely use a technology if it is easy to use and its operation is free of effort (Moses et al. 2013). In the present study, perceived usefulness describes the degree to which teachers believe that using cloud-based VLE can improve their teaching performance, while perceived ease of use refers {{to the extent to which}} teachers believe such systems can be used easily (Wang and Wang 2009). As the Frog VLE is not a new technology and had been implemented earlier, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are grounded on actual experience of use and hence reflect the realised utility of the technology (Bhattacherjee 2001).|$|R
