5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

500|$|Otis Phillips Lord, {{an elderly}} {{judge on the}} Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from Salem, in 1872 or 1873 became an {{acquaintance}} of Dickinson's. After the death of Lord's wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, {{especially in terms of}} shared literary interests; the few letters which survived contain multiple quotations of Shakespeare's work, including the plays Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Hamlet and King Lear. In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's Complete Concordance to Shakespeare (1877). Dickinson wrote that [...] "While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?" [...] She referred to him as [...] "My lovely Salem" [...] and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that [...] "Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day".|$|E

Chad {{told him that he}} must keep it to himself for the time being: angels had come to call him to his heavenly reward, and in seven days they would return to fetch him. So it was that Chad weakened and died after seven days– on 2 March, which remains his feast day. Bede writes that: [...] "he had always looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day– or rather his mind had always been on the Day of the Lord". Many years later, his old friend Egbert told a visitor that someone in Ireland had seen the heavenly company coming for Chad's soul and returning with it to heaven. Significantly, with the heavenly host was Cedd. Bede was not sure whether or not the vision was actually Egbert's own.|$|E
