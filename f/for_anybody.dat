5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Hartnett hit 24 {{home runs}} in 1925, {{breaking}} the single-season home run record for catchers set by Jack Clements in 1893. He finished second overall in the National League behind the 39 home runs hit by Rogers Hornsby. Although he led National League catchers in errors, he also led in range factor and in putouts, while his strong throwing arm helped him lead the league in assists and caught stealing percentage. Leo Durocher, who played against Hartnett and was a National League manager during Johnny Bench's career, stated that the two catchers had similarly strong throwing arms. During the major league baseball winter meetings in December 1925, it was rumored that Hartnett might be traded to the New York Giants for catcher Frank Snyder and outfielder Irish Meusel; however, Cubs president Bill Veeck, Sr., squelched the rumors saying that Hartnett would not be traded <b>for</b> <b>anybody.</b>|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing <b>for</b> <b>anybody.</b> It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|Tongan {{males were}} often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: {{because he was}} too high ranked <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> to touch him. Later it became the habit that a young Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.|$|E
5000|$|The Toy Wife was {{dismissed}} as a tearjerker and the plot was heavily criticized.

The critic also noted she was being [...] "too feminine". Neither she nor the studio was happy with the results.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970-71 season {{brought new}} {{additions}} to the cast include tall, lanky, sad-eyed Dennis Allen, who alternately played quietly zany characters and straight man <b>for</b> <b>anybody's</b> jokes; comic actress Ann Elder, who also contributed to scripts, tap dancer Barbara Sharma, who later appeared on Rhoda, and beefy Johnny Brown, who later played the superintendent Nathan [...] "Buffalo Butt" [...] Bookman on Good Times.|$|R

25|$|The {{incident}} also {{spurred the}} installation of security measures now common in most office buildings. Prior to the attack, it was possible <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> to enter a building and travel to any floor without question. After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} and fascinating dive <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> who ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one only has to have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a wonderful and popular dive.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{there are}} still {{considerable}} remains of the Clan Ranald left on the site. Almost the entire hull has collapsed, except for a portion that is held up by the port side boiler. The double hulled bottom of the bow is standing vertical and the bow section has collapsed forwards and downwards into two parts. There are still enormous boilers that remain on site, approximately 2-3 {{times the size of}} a diver and provide a spectacular site <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> who visits the site and the port main boiler has rolled out and is free of the hull remains. Underneath the collapsed hull, the engine still remains relatively intact.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to raise her spirits in the {{confined}} and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share with Susan. The smallness of the rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and staircase, struck her beyond her imagination.

25|$|To {{discourage}} Poles {{from giving}} shelter to Jews, the Germans often searched houses and introduced ruthless penalties. Poland {{was the only}} occupied country during World War II where the Nazis formally imposed the death penalty <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> found sheltering and helping Jews. The penalty applied {{not only to the}} person who did the helping, but also extended to his or her family, neighbors and sometimes to entire villages. In this way Germans applied the principle of collective responsibility whose purpose was to encourage neighbors to inform on each other in order to avoid punishment. The nature of these policies was widely known and visibly publicized by the Nazis who sought to terrorize the Polish population.|$|E
25|$|Meucci {{intended}} {{to develop his}} prototype but {{did not have the}} financial means to keep his company afloat in order to finance his invention. His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> to invest. Meucci then published his invention in the New York Italian-language newspaper L'Eco d'Italia, although no copy of such reports have ever been located dating back to searches prior to his court case in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras {{based on the}} iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system {{on the air in}} February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

60|$|Of {{the later}} Victorian novelists, {{chief among them}} being Meredith, Hardy and Stevenson, little may be said here, as they are much too near us to judge of their true place in the long {{perspective}} of English literature. Meredith, with the analytical temper and the disconnected style of Browning, is for mature readers, not for young people. Hardy has decided power, but is too hopelessly pessimistic <b>for</b> <b>anybody's</b> comfort,--except in his earlier works, which have a romantic charm that brightens the obscurity of his later philosophy.|$|R

It has been claimed to give rise to somewhat interesting and exciting games, where Black will have counterplay but has to be cautious about playing too passively. According to Garry Kasparov, the Pirc Defence is [...] "hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category", as it gives White [...] "too many opportunities <b>for</b> <b>anybody's</b> liking".|$|R
25|$|Peter Herdic {{used his}} wealth to gain {{political}} power in Williamsport and Lycoming County, and led the drive to have Williamsport chartered as a city in 1866. He spent $20,000 to get elected mayor of Williamsport in 1869. Local saloon keepers reported that Herdic would leave $10 and $20 bills among the bottles of their taverns <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> that would vote {{for him in the}} election. Prior to Herdic's arrival, the Newberry section of Williamsport was known as Jaysburg and had vied with Williamsport to be the county seat of Lycoming County. Herdic saw to it that the rival community on the west bank of Lycoming Creek would no longer compete with Williamsport by leading the cause to annex the community to Williamsport. Herdic had such influence {{that he was able to}} have the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad move their passenger station from the Pine Street area to his Herdic Hotel on West Fourth Street. Herdic was able to profit from this since the trains would now deposit their passengers at the door of his opulent hotel.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey just to see what England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E

50|$|When other negating {{words such}} as never, nobody, etc. appear in a sentence, the negating not is omitted (unlike its {{equivalents}} in many languages): I saw nothing or I didn't see anything, but not (except in non-standard speech) *I didn't see nothing (see Double negative). Such negating words generally have corresponding negative polarity items (ever <b>for</b> never, <b>anybody</b> <b>for</b> nobody, etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).|$|R
500|$|In 2009, Hazelwood {{offered a}} [...] "heartfelt apology" [...] {{to the people}} of Alaska, but {{suggested}} he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: [...] "The true story is out there <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story," [...] he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake. The apology appears in an interview in the book The Spill: Personal Stories from the Exxon Valdez Disaster by Sharon Bushell.|$|E
500|$|A two-disc [...] "deluxe edition" [...] was {{released}} by MCA on June 25, 2002. The first disc contains the remastered original album, while the second contains several radio edits and remixes. It was presented as a foldout double-disc set enhoused in a slipcase, with an extensive booklet with liner notes and rare photographs. AllMusic suggest that although the album deserves the attention, [...] "the extra disc of material is [...] worth the time of anyone outside of fanatics... it doesn't really offer any revelations, curiosities, or an interesting listen <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> else (and {{it may not be}} that interesting to those collectors, either)." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Tyler {{played the}} object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's.

Maybe it's not hard <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection." ...|$|E
