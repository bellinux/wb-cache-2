40|$|Abstract A {{substantial}} amount of research has investigated the influence of physical exercise during pregnancy on certain maternal and foetal parameters. Regarding the behaviour of the foetal heart rate (FHR) during the maternal exercise certain controversy exists; as several investigations have studied this parameter obtaining varied results. To test the hypotheses that the foetal heart rate (FHR) increases during maternal exercise, performed on a static bicycle during the third trimester. To know if {{the magnitude of the}} increase is related to gestational age or parity. This research involved a collaboration with the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Service of “Severo Ochoa” Hospital (Madrid) and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). The approval of the Committee of Investigation {{as well as of the}} Ethical Commission of the Hospital was obtained. Twenty healthy pregnant women have been studied, in the last trimester. No women showed any medical complications in their pregnancy or contraindications for the practice of physical exercise. Informed consent was obtained. The exercise protocol consisted in the first part (rest), followed by a session of 20 minutes of moderate work (static bicycle exercise) and then rest until the FHR returned to the pre-exercise levels. Data for the evaluation of the FHR was obtained using an Electronic <b>Foetal</b> <b>Monitor,</b> Philips FM 20; and an Accurex Plus, Polar Electro OY was used for the control of the maternal heart rate. The clinical history of the pregnant women provided data about medical and personal factors. For the statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and Student’s t test for unpaired data were used. Our results show increases (11 - 36 beats/min, mean= 24 beats/min) of the FHR in all the studied cases. The gestational age shows no correlation with increments of FHR (Pearson 0. 06) and there are larger increments of FHR in secundigravid (mean= 152 ± 6. 0 beats/min) than in primigravid (mean= 147 ± 4. 6 beats/min). maternal aerobic and moderate exercise developing during last trimester increments FHR without harmful effects. These increments do not depend on the maternal age. Parity has influence on the level of increments of the FHR. Resumen Una cantidad importante de investigaciones han valorado la influencia del ejercicio físico durante el embarazo en ciertos parámetros fetales. En relación al comportamiento de la frecuencia cardiaca foetal (FCF) durante la realización del ejercicio existe cierta controversia, muchas investigaciones han estudiado este parámetro con resultados variados. Comprobar la hipótesis de un aumento de la FCF durante la realización de ejercicio en bicicleta estática en el tercer trimestre de embarazo. También conocer si esos aumentos se relacionan con la edad gestacional o la paridad de la gestante. Este estudio se ha desarrollado mediante una colaboración entre el Servicio de Ginecología y Obstetricia del Hospital Severo Ochoa de Leganés y la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Se obtuvo la aprobación del Comité de Investigación así como de la Comisión Ética. Fueron estudiadas 20 gestantes en el último trimestre, sin complicaciones ni contraindicaciones médicas para el ejercicio, cada mujer firmó un consentimiento informado. El protocolo de ejercicio consistió en una primera parte de reposo, una sesión de 20 minutos de trabajo moderado en bicicleta estática y el reposo final con retorno a los niveles normales de FCF. Los datos correspondientes a la FCF se obtuvieron por medio de un Monitor Foetal Electrónico Philips FM 20, y un pulsómetro Accurex Plus, Polar Electro OY, fue usado para el control de la frecuencia cardíaca materna. La historia clínica de cada gestante aportó datos relativos a características médicas y personales. Para el análisis estadístico se utilizaron mecanismos descriptivos, el índice de correlación de Pearson y la t de Student para comparación de medias. Nuestros resultados muestran aumentos de la FCF de 11 - 36 lat/min (media de 24 lat/min). Los días de gestación no presentaron una correlación positiva con el nivel de los incrementos (Pearson 0. 06). Hubo mayores aumentos en gestantes secundigrávidas (media= 152 ± 6. 0 lat/min) que en primigrávidas (media= 147 ± 4. 6 lat/min). El ejercicio aeróbico y moderado materno desarrollado durante el tercer trimestre de embarazo incrementa la FCF sin efectos perjudiciales. Los aumentos no dependen de la edad gestacional de la madre. La paridad de la gestante tiene influencia en el nivel de los incrementos. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the basis for}} the clinical suspicion of foetal distress, the instituted managements and delivery outcome in a tertiary hospital in sub-Saharan Africa with limited capability for advanced <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Methods: It is a 3 -year retrospective analysis of all the obstetrics cases with intrapartum foetal distress. Results: There were 301 cases reviewed. The birth asphyxia incidence rate was 233 / 1000 live births and the perinatal death rate was 47 / 1000 live births. Suspicion of foetal distress was premised on the presence of persistent tachycardia or bradycardia during intermittent auscultation. Main resuscitative measures were left lateral repositioning of patient, fast saline infusion, intranasal oxygen administration and discontinuation of oxytocin infusion, if any. Only 124 (41. 2 %) of all the cases had delivery achieved within 2 ?h of diagnosis. Mean decision-delivery interval by caesarean section was 2. 93 ?±? 2. 05 ?h. Socio-demographic factors (p=? 0. 001) and pregnancy risk category (p?=? 0. 002) influenced incidence of birth asphyxia. Conclusion: To reduce subsisting high perinatal morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, it is best that at the least referral hospitals should have advanced facilities for <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> and shortened surgical intervention time...|$|R
40|$|Objective: A {{perinatal}} audit has {{the intention}} of quality of care improvement based on analysis of perinatal death, with our without analysis of maternal morbidity and/or mortality. Additional analysis of cases of intrapartum asphyxia could provide more insight into ways to improve quality of perinatal care. Methods: Analysis of cases of perinatal death and asphyxia in Jan Yperman Hospital, Ieper, Belgium, in 2012. Results: Three perinatal deaths occurred, none were preventable. Nineteen cases of proven metabolic acidosis have been identified. Three cases are considered possibly preventable, four cases are considered preventable. In three (possibly) preventable cases, <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> was absent during the active second stage of labour. In two preventable cases, intervention following a significant ST event in {{the second stage of}} labour was delayed. In one case intervention was delayed in the first stage of labour, while in another, indicated operative delivery in the second stage was not conducted. Conclusions: Integrating intrapartum asphyxia in the perinatal audit gives an opportunity to identify and eliminate weak points in the perinatal care chain, thereby optimizing quality of care.

40|$|International audienceSince its {{inception}} {{forty years ago}} as a way to control birth process, the cardiotocograph (CTG) has emerged over time and became the undisputed leader worldwide of noninvasive intrapartum <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems.

Thereby, many features appeared in the literature, ranging from the most common ones to artificially generated features, and computed using a wide variety of signal processing-based analysis tools: time scale, spectral or non-linear analysis, to name but a few. This survey paper, presents in a hierarchical order the most common processing steps of a CTG signal and focuses primarily on the feature extraction methods for foetal heart rate (FHR) analysis reported in the literature during the last decade.

40|$|Many {{midwives}} {{continue to}} use Continuous Electronic <b>Foetal</b> <b>Monitoring</b> (CEFM) on low risk women in labour, despite overwhelming clinical evidence that it is unnecessary. The use of CEFM on low risk labouring women {{has been linked to}} rising rates of medical intervention during labour and birth with no improvement in long term neonatal outcomes. This study examined the decision-making processes of midwives who used CEFM on low risk labouring women. Whilst a number of previous studies have examined various aspects of CEFM, none specific to midwives 2 ̆ 7 decision-making and CEFM on low risk labouring women. This study contributes to the literature in this specific area. The theoretical origins of Symbolic Interactionism and Grounded Theory (GT) methods underpin this study. SI, a sociological theory that emphasises meaning in human interactions and behaviours is used in this study to focus on the behaviours and interactions of five midwives 2 ̆ 7 when deciding to use CEFM on low risk labouring women. Primary data were collected by conducting unstructured interviews and systematic analysis was undertaken using GT methods to generate a substantive theory of: Midwives 2 ̆ 7 CEFM decision-making despite evidence based guidelines. The midwives made the decision that led to CEFM at two key points in the woman 2 ̆ 7 s labour care. Firstly, during the initial assessment of the woman and foetus, some midwives decided to use a baseline CTG rather than intermittent auscultation (IA). Secondly, following initial assessment, the midwives made an individualised assessment and decided whether to use CEFM as the method to monitor the foetus during labour. Trust was identified as the core variable, having a profound effect on the midwives 2 ̆ 7 decision-making at these two points. Another significant factor that impacted on decision-making was staff workload.;Recommendations relating to these findings promote that labouring women be central and intimately involved in decisions about <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Workplace reforms, such as the introduction of midwifery led models of care for women within a community setting are recommended to address professional trust and workload issues. Through the implementation of these recommendations it is expected that midwives will embrace the notion of woman centred care and that the unnecessary use of CEFM on low risk labouring women will be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The foetal {{heart rate}} {{variability}} {{is one of the}} most important parameters to monitor the health of the foetus. There are so many studies, both in time and frequency domain, which analyze the foetal {{heart rate variability}} and showed its significant diagnostic value. However, these studies have shown some limitations in highlighting some of the dynamics potentially relevant in controlling of heart rate. Therefore, methods of non-linear analysis have obtained a growing interest to analyze the chaotic nature of heart activity and they have already been successfully used in adults. As for <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring,</b> much less works are available. Recently, symbolic dynamics has been used to quantify the regularity of foetal heart rate, showing that its use can lead to a more complete and thorough understanding of normal physiological development of the foetus.

40|$|Among {{diagnostic}} {{techniques for}} <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring,</b> phonocardiography is gaining {{more and more}} interest for its low cost, passive nature and capability to detect some cardiac diseases. In spite of these characteristics, its use in clinical routine is still limited due to different troubles; for example, signals recorded through maternal abdomen show generally a quite low signal-to-noise ratio, so that detection and analysis of foetal heart sounds result very difficult. In this scenario, the availability of artificial phonocardiographic signals, simulated with conditions resembling different foetal conditions, week of gestation and noise amount, to name someone, {{can be a very}} useful tool to train medical staff. In this paper a software for phonocardiography simulation, updated to take account also of the split is presented.

The widespread use of ECG analysis has been hindered by the difficulties with poor signal quality and the difficulties in applying the specialised knowledge required for interpreting ECG patterns, in association with other events in labour, in an objective way. A fundamental investigation and development of optimal signal enhancement techniques that maximise the available information in the ECG signal, along with different techniques for detecting individual waveforms from poor quality signals, has been carried out. To automate the visual interpretation of the ECG waveform, novel techniques have been developed that allow reliable extraction of key features and hence allow a detailed ECG waveform analysis. Fuzzy logic is used to automatically classify the ECG waveform shape using these features by using knowledge that was elicited from expert sources and derived from example data. This allows the subtle changes in the ECG waveform to be automatically detected in relation to other events in labour, and thus improve the clinicians position for making an accurate diagnosis. To ensure the interpretation is based on reliable information and takes place in the proper context, a new and sensitive index for assessing the quality of the ECG has been developed. New techniques to capture, {{for the first time in}} machine form, the clinical expertise / guidelines for electronic <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> have been developed based on fuzzy logic and finite state machines, The software model provides a flexible framework to further develop and optimise rules for ECG pattern analysis.

Very few studies directly compared CTG with foetal scalp blood (FBS) and CTG only. Only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) was published in the 1970 s and had limited power to assess neonatal outcome. Direct and indirect comparisons conclude that FBS could reduce the number of caesarean deliveries {{associated with the use of}} continuous CTG. The main drawbacks of FBS are its invasive and discontinuous nature and the need for a sufficient volume of foetal blood for analysis, especially for pH measurement, resulting in failure rates reaching 10 %. FBS for lactate measurement became popular with the design of test-strip devices, requiring < 0. 5  mL of foetal blood. RCTs showed similar outcomes with the use of FBS for lactates compared with pH in terms of obstetrical interventions and neonatal outcomes. In conclusion, there is some evidence that FBS reduces the need for operative deliveries.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of cardiotocography in <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring,</b> the evaluation of foetal status suffers from a considerable inter and intra-observer variability. In order to overcome the main limitations of visual cardiotocographic assessment, computerised methods to analyse cardiotocographic recordings have been recently developed. In this study, a new software for automated analysis of foetal heart rate is presented. It allows an automatic procedure for measuring the most relevant parameters derivable from cardiotocographic traces. Simulated and real cardiotocographic traces were analysed to test software reliability. In artificial traces, we simulated a set number of events (accelerations, decelerations and contractions) to be recognised. In the case of real signals, instead, results of the computerised analysis were compared with the visual assessment performed by 18 expert clinicians and three performance indexes were computed to gain information about performances of the proposed software. The software showed preliminary performance we judged satisfactory in that the results matched completely the requirements, as proved by tests on artificial signals in which all simulated events were detected from the software. Performance indexes computed in comparison with obstetricians' evaluations are, on the contrary, not so satisfactory; in fact they led to obtain the following values of the statistical parameters: sensitivity equal to 93 %, positive predictive value equal to 82 % and accuracy equal to 77 %.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} Caesarean section rates {{being observed}} in most facilities will ultimately {{result in a}} larger proportion of women with previous scar. Choices need to be made by both the patient and the health worker between attempted vaginal birth after Caesarean section (VBAC) and Elective Repeat Caesarean section (ERCS). Both practices are associated with perinatal risks and benefits that call for certain objectivity and prudence in decision making especially where resources are scarce. Objective: To determine perceptions on the practice of vaginal birth after Caesarean section among maternity service providers in East Africa. Design: A semi-qualitative cross sectional survey using self-administered questionnaires. Setting: The study was undertaken among delegates attending a regional obstetrics and gynaecology conference in Mombasa, Kenya. Subject: Sixty-three consenting delegates were interviewed Results: A majority (69. 8 %) of the respondents were consultants and midwives working in government facilities. Fifty-eight out of the 63 respondents offered VBAC in their institutions despite acknowledging sub-optimal antenatal preparation. The main concerns identified were; deficiencies in healthcare delivery systems, inadequate human resources, lack of unit guidelines, inappropriate maternal education and inappropriate <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> tools. Conclusion: The practice of vaginal birth after Caesarean section was perceived to be sub-optimal with many existing deficiencies that need urgent action {{to ensure the safety of}} mothers and newborns.

The research was designed to provide a deeper understanding of the integration of technology into midwives' practice and to identify and examine aspects of training needs. Methods. Over 400 midwives responded to a questionnaire seeking information on their experiences and perceived competence with labour ward technology, with a particular focus on the use of cardiotocograph machines (CTGs) for electronic <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The survey sought views on the extent to which midwives trust the technology, their perceived levels of training and competence, their awareness of policy relating to technological intervention and the issue of women's choice in whether the progress of their delivery is technologically monitored. Findings. The majority of midwives in this survey trust the use of technology but have concerns about issues of safety in relation to potential faults, and to their perceived lack of training in technology usage. The majority also indicated that they prefer a nontechnological birth although many point to the benefits of technological support when difficulties are encountered. The use of technology is seen as multi-professional and there was much support among the respondents for multi-disciplinary training in the use of technologies in future curricula. Conclusions. If the various findings of this sample survey were to be consolidated for midwives as a whole, they suggest that provisions for continuing professional development may need to address technological awareness and competence in a more focused manner than is discernible at present...|$|R

5000|$|The legal {{debate on}} fetal rights {{sometimes}} invokes {{the notion of}} fetal viability. Its primary determinant is fetal lung capacity which typically develops at twenty-three to twenty-four weeks. The twenty-three weeks is usually regarded as the lower bound of fetal viability because technology {{has been unable to}} surpass the limit set by lung development. It was nonetheless stated that technology has made it possible to regard the fetus as a patient independent of the mother. In Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. G., the judges argued that [...] "technologies like real-time ultrasound, <b>foetal</b> heart <b>monitors</b> and foetoscopy can clearly show us that the foetus is alive" [...] and thus the born alive rule is [...] "outdated and indefensible".|$|R

[...] It was established by the American medical duo Pat and Marian Kennedy {{at the invitation of}} Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who was then the Governor of Al Ain. At the time of its establishment, Al Ain had very high infant and maternal mortality rates, with as many as one in two infants and one in three women dying for want of adequate medical care. So drastic was the impact of the hospital in reducing mortality that a simple wooden <b>foetal</b> heart <b>monitor</b> was chosen in 2011 as one of the 40 objects that shaped modern UAE by the National newspaper.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Waterbirth {{has been}} {{increasing}} in popularity in Asia (Lea W. Water babies. The Straits Times 17 February 2011. Available at [URL] National University Hospital, Singapore, is the pioneer hospital offering waterbirths to women since 2006 in a unique setting of a consultant-led service and continuous <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> To date, no {{studies have been done}} on the conduct of waterbirths in an Asia. This study aims to evaluate if water immersion during delivery is associated with increased rates of adverse maternal and foetal outcomes as compared with conventional vaginal deliveries. Materials and Methods: Clinical records of women who birthed underwater at National University Hospital between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes of interest were estimated blood loss, third- or fourth degree tears, incidence of postpartum infections or haemorrhage, neonatal Apgars at 1 and 5 min, and neonatal complications requiring intensive care unit admission. Outcomes were compared against a matched control group of women who had conventional vaginal deliveries within ≤ 1 month. Results: Records of 118 women who birthed underwater were accrued. There {{was no significant difference in}} estimated blood loss and postpartum haemorrhage between groups, and there were no cases of maternal infection, third- or fourth-degree perineal tears, or adverse neonatal outcomes in either group. Women in the control group were more likely to have episiotomies (63. 6 % vs. 0. 85 %; p < 0. 01). Three cases of retained placenta were reported in the waterbirth group (0. 03 %). Conclusion: Waterbirth at our centre does not appear to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. The results of this study supported waterbirth as a birthing option to groups of low-risk women in an obstetrician-led setting with good midwifery support...|$|R
40|$|Four {{pregnant}} women, aged 29, 32, 36 and 36 years, respectively, {{were diagnosed}} with Human parvovirus B 19 (B 19 V) infection. Only the first woman had exanthema and fever. In the first three cases, the source of infection appeared to be another child; two of these children were infected during a school outbreak. All four foetuses were infected, but the first foetus was asymptomatic and healthy at birth. The second foetus had anaemia and increased blood flow in the middle cerebral artery; it received an intrauterine transfusion and was healthy at birth. The third foetus was almost immobile and had cardiomegaly and hydrops fetalis; it was dead upon induced birth. In the fourth case, pregnancy was uneventful until two days before parturition, when the mother reported a decrease in foetal movement. The infant was born and developed respiratory insufficiency after 8 hours. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral lesions in frontal, occipital and parietal white matter consistent with infarction. The infant died after 5 days. Infection with B 19 V {{is associated with a}} wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes. Effects may range from an uncomplicated pregnancy to severe hydrops fetalis or intrauterine foetal death. Maternal symptoms may be aspecific, which complicates early diagnosis. When maternal B 19 V infection is suspected, immediate investigation for recent B 19 V infection should be performed. Quantitative B 19 viral load measurements may provide insight into the stage of infection and may guide <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Referral to a foetal therapy unit is essential for hydrops fetalis or severe foetal anaemia. Intrauterine transfusion with erythrocytes significantly improves foetal outcome. Despite a successful transfusion procedure, long-term neurodevelopment may be affected, and developmental follow up is advise...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in medical intervention {{has had a}} significant influence {{over the last century}} in western and developed countries, and such practices continue to increase despite efforts to encourage normal childbirth. The aim of this project is to explore the use of interventions during the second stage of labour among healthcare professionals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and determine what factors may be influencing their use. It builds on the findings of my Master’s dissertation, which identified a high rate of routine interventions. To fulfil this aim, the research includes data from an exploratory qualitative study, conducted using an ethnographic approach. Data collection methods included participant observations of 19 labours and births (11 in HA and 8 in HB) and semi-structured interviews with 29 healthcare professionals (16 in HA and 13 in HB) comprising obstetricians [n= 10], midwives [n= 12], nurses [n= 6] and nurse-midwife [n= 1] from two government hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In addition, the hospital labour and delivery ward policies and guidelines from those hospitals were also collected. Data were collected between October 2011 and September 2012 in Jeddah, after seeking ethical approval from City University London and from each of the hospitals involved in the study. All participant observations, interviews, field diary, and hospital documentation was recorded using a word processing package (Word 2010) and then transferred into qualitative data analysis software (QDAS) (Atlas. ti 7), which was used for the data analysis. My first impressions of these data are that there are many interventions used during labour and births, which are influenced by many factors mentioned by the healthcare professionals during the interviews or observed during birth. These factors are likely, however, to cluster into a smaller number of broad themes. One of the major themes that I am currently analysing is the routine use of the Electronic <b>Foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> (EFM) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore {{reported}} hospital {{policies and}} practices during normal childbirth in maternity wards in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to assess and verify whether these practices are evidence-based. Design: Quantitative design, {{in the form of}} a descriptive questionnaire, based on a tool extracted from the literature. Setting: Nine government hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. These hospitals have varied ownership, including Ministry of Health (MOH), military, teaching and other government hospitals. Participants: Key individuals responsible for the day-to-day running of the maternity ward. Measurements: Nine interviews using descriptive structured questionnaire were conducted. Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 16. 0). Findings: The surveyed hospitals were found to be well equipped to deal with obstetric emergencies, and many follow evidence-based procedures. On average, the Caesarean section rate was found to be 22. 4 %, but with considerable variances between hospitals. Some unnecessary procedures that are known to be ineffective or harmful and that are not recommended for routine use, including pubic shaving, enemas, episiotomy, electronic <b>foetal</b> <b>monitoring</b> (EFM) and intravenous (IV) infusion, were found to be frequently practiced. Only 22 % of the hospitals sampled reported allowing a companion to attend labour and delivery. Key Conclusions: Many aspects of recommended EBP were used in the hospitals studied. However, the results of this study clearly indicate that there is wide variation between hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in some obstetric practices. Furthermore, the findings suggest that some practices at these hospitals are not supported by evidence as being beneficial for mothers or babies and are positively discouraged under international guidelines. Implications for practice: This study has specific implications for obstetricians, midwives and nurses working in maternity Units. It gives an overview of current hospital {{policies and practices}} during normal childbirth. It is likely to contribute to improving the health and well-being of women, and have implications for service provision. It could also help in the development of technical information for policy-makers, and health care professionals for normal childbirth care...|$|R
