50|$|The Air Force closed Graham AB in late 1960, despite {{efforts of}} {{influential}} Florida Congressman Robert L. F. Sikes {{to keep it}} running. As the installation was being scaled down as a military facility, the industrial committee of the Junior Chamber of Commerce worked to adapt the air base into a combination industrial park and civilian airport. The 3300th Training Squadron was inactivated on 1 February 1961 and the base's air traffic control tower permanently closed. ATC wanted to close the base in March, but an Air Force <b>imposed</b> <b>freeze</b> on shipping property delayed its final closure. However, on 31 August 1961 the base was inactivated as a military installation and turned over to civil control.|$|E
50|$|WAKR {{also started}} Akron's first {{television}} station WAKR-TV in 1953. Originally {{intended as a}} VHF licensee on channel 11, it wound up on channel 49 after an FCC <b>imposed</b> <b>freeze</b> on future VHF stations, {{as well as a}} merging of the Cleveland and Akron markets into one single market. The station moved to channel 23 in 1967, and was affiliated with ABC despite Cleveland's WEWS also holding an ABC affiliation. Many of WAKR's personalities shared airtime on the TV side throughout this time period; current afternoon host Tim Daugherty was a weatherman on WAKR-TV for many years. The TV station changed its callsign to WAKC-TV in 1986 when Group One was broken up, and it now known as Ion Television owned & operated station WVPX-TV, targeted to the Cleveland market.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research {{was to examine the}} response of woody plant tissues to freezing stress by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nonsupercooling species red osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera Michx.), weeping willow (Salix babylonica L.), and corkscrew willow (Salix matsudana Koidz. f. tortuosa Rehd.) survived freezing stress as low as − 60 °C. Cell collapse of ray parenchyma cells of these species was expected but did not occur. It was concluded that ray parenchyma cells of these species do not fit into either the supercooling or extracellular freezing classifications. Tissues from flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv “Starking III”), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muench.), and red ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh) were confirmed as supercooling species, and did not survive exposures below − 40 °C. Ray parenchyma cells of these species did not collapse in response to freezing stress, as was expected. Cell collapse along the margins of voids were observed in bark of all seven species. Voids were the result of extracellular ice crystals formed in the bark during exposure to freezing stress. Tissues prepared by freeze substitution techniques were found to be adequately preserved when compared to those prepared by conventional fixation and low temperature SEM techniques. A <b>freezing</b> protocol for <b>imposing</b> <b>freezing</b> stress at temperatures lower than experienced naturally in the area where the study was conducted was developed that produced responses comparable to those observed in specimens collected in the field during natural freezing events...|$|R
