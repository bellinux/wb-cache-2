[...] For I <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you."

60|$|These, my friends, are {{the holy}} and thankful {{thoughts}} which {{ought to be}} in your hearts every day and hour. This is the thought which God meant to put into your hearts when He made sailors of you, and brought you into the world, by the sea-side, to take up your business in great waters. You might have been born in Bristol or Liverpool or London, and never seen anything but streets and houses, and man's clumsy work. But God has been very good to you. He has brought you up here, in this happy West country, where you may see His wonderful works day and night; where you ought never to forget that you have a Father in heaven who made the sea, and who keeps you safe at sea by night and day. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a great deal. He <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> two books to read--the book of God's Word, the Bible, and the book of God's earth, the sky and sea and land, which is above you and below you and around you day and night. If you can read and understand them properly, you will find in them everything which you want; you may learn from them to be holy in this world and happy in the next. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you,</b> too, fathers, mothers, wives, children, a comfortable home, a holy trade--the same which the apostles followed. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> England for your country, and the West country--the best place in England for your home. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a good Queen, and good magistrates and landlords. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>you</b> health and strength, and seamanship, and clear heads and stout hearts. And God has made you seamen and fishermen, and <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a business in which you can see God's mighty power and wisdom day and night, and feel Him taking care of you when you cannot take care of yourselves.|$|R

True, it is painful now, sorrowful now, penitent now, grieved now; now it is broken, now it bleeds, now, now it sobs, now it sighs, now it mourns and crieth unto God. Well, very well; all this is because he hath a mind to make thee laugh; he has made thee sorry on earth that thou mightest rejoice in heaven.
