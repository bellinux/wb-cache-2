5000|$|Suppose that an IQ {{test has}} three subtests: vocabulary, arithmetic, and picture analogies. The scores {{on each of}} the subtests are {{normalized}} (see standard score) and then added together to produce a composite IQ score. Now suppose that Joe obtains the maximum score of 20 on the arithmetic test, but gets 10 out of 20 on the vocabulary and analogies tests. Is {{it fair to say that}} Joe's total score of 20+10+10, or 40, represents his total ability? The answer is no, because Joe achieved the maximum possible score of 20 on the arithmetic test. Had the arithmetic test included additional, more difficult items, Joe might have gotten 30 points on that subtest, producing a [...] "true" [...] score of 30+10+10 or 50.
