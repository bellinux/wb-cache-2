40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} of second-generation high-temperature superconductors (HTS) made from YBCO coated conductors in accelerator magnet technology was demonstrated by a consortium under {{the lead of}} Danfysik. A 3 T demonstrator dipole magnet was designed, built and tested by the consortium. In total 2. 5 km HTS tape was manufactured and tested by SuperPower. The tape was <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> <b>spool</b> lengths 0 varying from 93 m to 172 m and had a minimum Ic of 115 A or more. The tape was insulated with a 0. 025 mm thin epoxy film before winding in total 14 saddle coils and 4 racetrack coils and subsequent impregnation with epoxy. All coils were azimuthally arranged in an ellipse configuration {{in order to achieve}} a cosine-theta-like current distribution around a circular good field with a diameter of 52 mm and a magnetic field length of 250 mm. The cold-mass consisting of the coil arrangement clamped in between a steel substrate and an aluminum collar and a surrounding laminated iron yoke, was mounted in a cryostat. The cold-mass is contact-cooled by two GM cryocooler...|$|R
