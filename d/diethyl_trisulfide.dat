40|$|Alk(en) yl trisulfides (R-SSS-R′) are {{organosulfur}} compounds {{produced by}} crushed garlic and other Allium vegetables. We {{found that these}} compounds exhibit potent anticancer effects through the reaction with microtubules, causing cell cycle arrest. Nine alk(en) yl trisulfides including dimethyl trisulfide, <b>diethyl</b> <b>trisulfide,</b> dipropyl trisulfide (DPTS), dibutyl trisulfide, dipentyl trisulfide, diallyl trisulfide (DATS), dibutenyl trisulfide, dipentenyl trisulfide and allyl methyl trisulfide were synthesized and added to cultures of HT- 29 human colon cancer cells at a concentration of 10 μM. The trisulfides with alkenyl groups such as DATS, but not those with alkyl groups, induced rapid microtubule disassembly at 30 – 60 min as well as cell cycle arrest during the mitotic phase approximately at 4 h after the treatment. Both DATS-induced microtubule disassembly and the cell cycle arrest were cancelled by the simultaneous treatment of the cancer cells with 2 mM L-cysteine, glutathione (GSH) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Reciprocally, L-buthionine-(S,R) -sulfoximine (500 μM), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, enhanced the power of DATS in inducing the cell cycle arrest. These results indicate that alk(en) yl trisulfide react with sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues of cellular proteins such as microtubule proteins. Thus, the present study provides evidence that trisulfides with alkenyl groups have potent anticancer activities, at least in part, directed toward microtubules. These findings suggest that alkenyl trisulfides and their structurally related compounds may provide novel and effective anticancer agents...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern with air and odor {{emissions}} from agricultural facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement the U. S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, <b>diethyl</b> disulfide, dimethyl <b>trisulfide,</b> hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|R
