40|$|Background : The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{associations}} of physical activity, sport participation, and body composition on the risk of symptoms of mental health problems in a large population-based sample of Norwegian adolescents. Methods : Analyses were based on 4 -year longitudinal data from the Young-HUNT studies in Norway among 2000 adolescents aged 13 - 19 years. We calculated relative risks of anxiety/depression symptoms, as well as of <b>feeling</b> <b>downhearted</b> and dissatisfied with life, in relation to various measures of physical activity, sports participation, anthropometric measures, and body image. Results : Overall, physical activity was inversely associated with the risk for anxiety/depression in boys (Ptrend, 0. 02), but not in girls (P-trend, 0. 34). Girls who considered themselves “very fat/chubby” had a higher risk than those who considered themselves as “about the same as others” (RR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 1. 7), whereas in boys, the risk was highest for those who considered themselves as “thin/very thin” (RR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 2. 7). Analysis of the risk of <b>feeling</b> <b>downhearted</b> <b>or</b> dissatisfied with life showed an inverse association for physical activity, both in girls and boys, and there was also a U-shaped association with body image. Conclusion : Physical activity was inversely related to risk of anxiety/depression in boys, but not in girls, and inversely related to the risk of <b>feeling</b> <b>downhearted</b> and dissatisfied with life in both genders. Body image was strongly associated with symptoms of anxiety/depression and measures of well-being, whereas body size showed no clear associations. These results suggest that self-perception of appearance are more important for mental health in adolescents than the actual body composition, and that being physically active may be beneficial, especially among boys...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectivesThe EuroQol (EQ- 5 D) and SF- 6 D (derived {{from the}} SF- 12) were {{compared}} to assess any ceiling effect in the EQ- 5 D and the SF- 6 D descriptive systems. In addition, the Physical Component Summary (PCS- 12), the Mental Component Summary (MCS- 12) and the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) were compared on their discriminative ability to detect differences among individuals with different morbidities and sociodemographic characteristics. MethodsData from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey {{were used for the}} analysis. A total of 11, 248 individuals that were 18 years or older and had data on all the study variables were included in the analysis. ResultsA total of 5104 individuals (47 %) reported no limitations on all of the EQ- 5 D dimensions and only 683 (5. 8 %) were classified in full health based on the SF- 6 D descriptive system. Approximately 49 % of the respondents that reported no limitations on the EQ- 5 D reported <b>feeling</b> “tense <b>or</b> <b>downhearted</b> and low,” “a little,” (level 2) or “some” (level 3) of the time on SF- 6 D. PCS- 12 scores and EQ-VAS scores among individuals reporting no limitations on the EQ- 5 D descriptive system were significantly lower for respondents reporting coronary heart disease, angina, diabetes, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure or joint pain compared with respondents that reported no medical condition. Effect sizes for medical conditions using the PCS- 12 were larger than the effect sizes using the EQ-VAS. ConclusionsUnlike the EQ- 5 D descriptive system, the SF- 6 D descriptive system derived from the SF- 12 {{does not seem to have}} a ceiling effect. Nevertheless, the SF- 6 D does not discriminate between individuals with different morbidities who report full health on the EQ- 5 D, as does the PCS- 12 and the EQ-VAS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Population studies {{frequently}} {{employ a}} single item dependent variable for overall health. Self-rated mental health {{has been the}} focus of attention less often. The purpose of this project was to investigate the relationship between use of medical care and poor mental health in an elderly population. Methods This study involved a cross-sectional telephone survey of persons over 65 years of age in West Texas, a sparsely-populated 108 -county region. Independent variables included number of medical visits, race/ethnicity, age, gender and ability to pay for care. Mental health was measured by asking subjects how often they felt <b>downhearted</b> <b>or</b> blue. Results Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that more medical visits were made by persons who were <b>downhearted</b> <b>or</b> blue. Females, persons who had difficulty paying for care, Hispanic respondents, and older persons were more likely to report poor mental health. Conclusions Elderly persons in this region who use more medical care are at greater risk of being in poor mental health. Public health agencies that are planning population-based approaches to improving mental health should consider targeting persons who are high users of medical care as well as those of limited means, women, persons of Hispanic ethnicity, and people who are of greater age. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine whether}} the {{prevalence}} of regional and chronic widespread pain (CWP) varies with rurality and to determine the characteristics of persons in rural locations in whom pain {{is found to be}} in excess. Methods: Participants, aged ≥ 55 years, from participating general practices in seven different geographical locations in Scotland were sent a postal questionnaire. The 1 -month prevalence of 10 regional pain conditions plus CWP was identified using body manikins. Differences in {{the prevalence of}} pain with differing rurality were examined using Chi 2 test for trend. Thereafter, among the rural population, the relationships between pain and putative risk factors were examined using Poisson regression. Thus, results are described as risk ratios. Results: There was some evidence to suggest that the prevalence of CWP increased with increasing rurality, although the magnitude of this was slight. No large or significant differences were observed with any regional pain conditions. Factors associated with the reporting of CWP included poor general health, <b>feeling</b> <b>downhearted</b> most of the time and selected measures of social contact. Factors independently associated with CWP included female gender (risk ratio: 1. 24; 95...|$|R

Despite Rassin, Merkelbach and Muris reporting that this finding is moderately robust in the literature, some studies were unable to replicate results.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of emotion regulation strategies on self-reported emotions and 1600  m track running performance. In stage 1 of a three-stage study, participants (N[*]=[*] 15) reported emotional states associated with best, worst and ideal performance. Results indicated that a best and ideal emotional state for performance composed of feeling happy, calm, energetic and moderately anxious whereas the worst emotional state for performance composed of <b>feeling</b> <b>downhearted,</b> sluggish and highly anxious. In stage 2, emotion regulation interventions were developed using online material and supported by electronic feedback. One intervention motivated participants to increase the intensity of unpleasant emotions (e. g. feel more angry and anxious). A second intervention motivated participants to reduce the intensity of unpleasant emotions (e. g. feel less angry and anxious). In stage 3, using a repeated measures design, participants used each intervention before running a 1600  m time trial. Data were compared with a no treatment control condition. The intervention designed to increase the intensity of unpleasant emotions resulted in higher anxiety and lower calmness scores but no significant effects on 1600  m running time. The intervention designed to reduce the intensity of unpleasant emotions was associated with significantly slower times for the first 400  m. We suggest future research should investigate emotion regulation, emotion and performance using quasi-experimental methods with performance measures that are meaningful to participants...|$|R
