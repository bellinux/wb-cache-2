40|$|BACKGROUND: Anti-insulin {{antibodies}} (AIA) {{occur in}} diabetic dogs after insulin therapy, although their clinical significance is unclear. HYPOTHESIS: Treatment of diabetic dogs with heterologous insulin {{is more likely}} to stimulate production of AIA than is treatment with homologous insulin. ANIMALS: Diabetic dogs sampled before insulin therapy (n = 40), diabetic dogs sampled following treatment with porcine (homologous) <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 100), bovine (heterologous) lente <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 100), or bovine protamine zinc (PZI) <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 20), and nondiabetic control dogs (n = 120). METHODS: Prospective observational study. Sera were analyzed by ELISA for antibodies against porcine insulin, bovine insulin, insulin A, B, or C peptides, and control antigens; canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine thyroglobulin (TG). Canine isotype-specific antibodies were used to determine total and anti-insulin IgG 1 : IgG 2 ratios. RESULTS: There was no difference in CDV or TG reactivity among the groups. AIA were detected in 5 of 40 newly diagnosed (untreated) diabetic dogs. There {{was no significant difference in}} AIA (ELISA optical density reactivity) comparing control and porcine insulin-treated diabetic dogs (P >. 05). Anti-insulin reactivity was most prevalent in bovine PZI insulin-treated dogs (90 %; P <. 01), and bovine lente insulin-treated dogs (56 %; P <. 01). AIA induced by treatment were enriched for the IgG 1 isotype. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study indicates that bovine insulin is more immunogenic than porcine insulin when used for treatment of diabetic dogs...|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We surveyed insulin-naïve patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, already treated with two or more oral agents who were recently prescribed insulin. We compared responses for respondents prescribed, but never initiating, <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 69) with those dispensed <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 100). RESULTS Subjects failing to initiate prescribed insulin commonly reported misconceptions regarding insulin risk (35 % believed that insulin causes blindness, renal failure, amputations, heart attacks, strokes, or early death), plans to instead work harder on behavioral goals, sense of personal failure, low self-efficacy, injection phobia, hypoglycemia concerns, negative impact on social life and job, inadequate health literacy, health care provider inadequately explaining risks/benefits, and limited insulin self-management training.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the ability of insulin to modulate the response to beta-adrenergic action on myocardial contractility, assessed as percentage changes of developed tension, in isolated rat papillary muscle. Dose-response curves for isoproterenol, calcium, and forskolin were constructed in an incremental fashion with {{the presence or absence of}} insulin at the dose of 50 muU/mL. Dose-response curves for isoproterenol on insulin background were also assessed in the presence and absence of a selective antagonist for beta(2) -adrenoceptor, ICI, at the dose of 5 x 10 (- 8) mol/L. Insulin did not modify the dose-response curve to calcium (EC(50) : 1. 4 +/- 0. 4 mmol/Lfor <b>insulin,</b> <b>n</b> = 8 v 1. 5 +/- 0. 3 mmol/L for control, n = 8; P = not significant), whereas it was able to shift to the left the dose-response curve and reduce significantly the EC(50) of isoproterenol (EC(50) : 0. 2 +/- 0. 2 nmol/L for <b>insulin,</b> <b>n</b> = 13 v 1. 1 +/- 0. 4 nmol/L for control, n = 12; P <. 01). ICI shifted to the right dose-response curve of isoproterenol and increased about 10 -fold the EC(50) value of isoproterenol, but insulin was still able to shift to the left dose-response curve of isoproterenol and to reduce significantly the EC(50) of isoproterenol also in the presence of ICI (EC(50) : 11. 0 +/- 1. 5 nmol/L for ICI, n = 7 v 1. 9 +/- 0. 8 nmol/L for ICI + <b>insulin,</b> <b>n</b> = 7; P <. 01). Insulin did not modify the dose-response curve to forskolin.

Since IDDM also occurs in older {{patients}} where non-insulin-dependent diabetes is common, we studied GAD 65 Ab at onset to classify diabetes type. Our quantitative immunoprecipitation assay uses recombinant human islet GAD 65 stably expressed in hamster fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility was identical to native islet GAD 65. Like native antigen, recombinant GAD 65 migrated as two bands during electrophoresis, but converted to one under stronger reduction. Immunoprecipitation was linear {{with respect to}} antibody or antigen concentration. In 120 population-based diabetic patients of all ages grouped by treatment at onset and after 18 mo, GAD 65 Ab were present in 70 % on <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 37), 10 % on oral agent (n = 62, P < 0. 0001), 69 % changing from oral agent to <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 16, P < 0. 001), and 1 of 33 controls. 65 % with GAD 65 Ab, versus 8 % without, changed from oral agent to insulin (P < 0. 01). The GAD 65 Ab quantitative index was remarkably stable, and only 2 of 32 patients changed antibody status during follow-up. Concordance between GAD 65 Ab and islet cell antibodies was 93 %.

40|$|Background: We set out {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between different measures of glycemic variability {{and the rate of}} hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects and Methods: Data were pooled from three 24 -week insulin trials including patients on twice-daily (BID) insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 (75 % insulin lispro protamine suspension, 25 % <b>insulin</b> lispro) (<b>n</b> = 805), daily (QD) <b>insulin</b> glargine (<b>n</b> = 1, 019), insulin lispro protamine suspension (n = 353) (QD or BID), and <b>insulin</b> detemir (<b>n</b> = 166) (QD or BID), all with continuation of prestudy oral antihyperglycemic medications. Glycemic variability measures were derived from seven-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles. Results: At baseline, mean (+/- SD) age was 56. 9 +/- 9. 7 years, duration of type 2 diabetes was 9. 5 +/- 6. 1 years, hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) was 8. 9 +/- 1. 1 %, and 51. 9 % were male. Intra-day glucose coefficient of variation (CV), fasting blood glucose, intra-day minimum glucose and inter-day glucose CV at 24 weeks, and intra-day glucose CV at baseline were significantly correlated with the rate of hypoglycemia events between Weeks 12 to 24 (P < 0. 05 for all measures). Conclusions: Intra-day and inter-day glycemic variability is significantly associated with the risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for mean glucose and HbA 1 c. The intra-day glycemic variability before starting insulin is significantly associated with the risk of hypoglycemia during insulin treatment, which points at treatment-and patient-related factors mediating this relationshi...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Derangements of {{posttraumatic}} glucose metab-olism {{have long}} been recognized, with observed changes impli-cating abnormal action of insulin on target tissues. Insulin is important as well in fat metabolism, and "resistance " to insu-lin’s effects on lipid metabolism after injury has been demon-strated. Although fat-derived fuels are the body’s major energy source during starvation and after injury, most studies of post-traumatic insulin "resistance " have focused on carbohydrate metabolism. This study investigated adipose tissue response to <b>insulin</b> <b>n</b> vitro in rats subjected to starvation and/or trauma. Relationships between various parameters, including adipocyte size and weight, plasma glucose, insulin, and glycerol, and basal and insulin-suppressed lipolytic rates, were also studied.

We examined the effect of insulin sensitivity and central adiposity on lipoproteins in 196 individuals (75 men and 121 women) {{with an average age}} of 52. 7 years. Subjects were subdivided into three groups based on BMI and their insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) : lean <b>insulin</b> sensitive (<b>n</b> = 65), lean <b>insulin</b> resistant (<b>n</b> = 73), and obese <b>insulin</b> resistant (<b>n</b> = 58). This categorization revealed that both obesity and {{insulin resistance}} determined the lipoprotein profile. In addition, the insulin-resistant groups had increased central adiposity. Increasing intra-abdominal fat (IAF) area, quantified by computed tomography scan and decreasing S(I), were important determinants of an atherogenic profile, marked by increased triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and decreased HDL cholesterol and LDL buoyancy (Rf). Density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGUC) revealed that in subjects who had more IAF and were more insulin resistant, the cholesterol content was increased in VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and dense LDL fractions whereas it was reduced in HDL fractions. Multiple linear regression analysis of the relation between the cholesterol content of each DGUC fraction as the dependent variable and IAF and S(I) as independent variables revealed that the cholesterol concentration in the fractions corresponding to VLDL, IDL, dense LDL, and HDL was associated with IAF, and that S(I) additionally contributed independently to VLDL, but not to IDL, LDL, or HDL. Thus an atherogenic lipoprotein profile appears to be the result primarily of an increase in IAF, perhaps via insulin resistance. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U.

Oral and intravenous glucose stimulated <b>insulin</b> release (<b>n</b> = 849) and <b>insulin</b> sensitivity (<b>n</b> = 596) estimated from a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were measured in non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients from five European populations. Assuming an additive genetic model the diabetes-associated major C-allele of rs 4607103 near ADAMTS 9 associated with reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0. 002) during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. However, following intravenous and oral administration of glucose serum insulin release was increased in individuals with the C-allele (p = 0. 003 and p = 0. 01, respectively). A meta-analyse combining clamp and IVGTT data from a total of 905 non-diabetic individuals showed that the C-risk allele associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (p = 0. 003) and increased insulin release (p = 0. 002). The major T-allele of the intronic JAZF 1 rs 864745 conferring increased diabetes risk was associated with increased 2 (nd) phase serum insulin release during an IVGTT (p = 0. 03), and an increased fasting serum insulin level (p = 0. 001). The remaining variants did not show any associations with insulin response, insulin sensitivity or any other measured quantitative traits. The present studies suggest that the diabetogenic impact of the C-allele of rs 4607103 near ADAMTS 9 may in part be mediated through decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues...|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is associated with}} a low chronic inflammatory state. In this study we investigated the relationship between impaired insulin sensitivity and selected markers of inflammation and thrombin generation in obese healthy women. We examined 32 healthy obese women (body mass index ≥ 28), with normal <b>insulin</b> sensitivity (NIS, <b>n</b> = 14) or impaired <b>insulin</b> sensitivity (<b>n</b> = 18), and 10 nonobese women (body mass index < 25). Impaired insulin sensitivity patients had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), TGF-β 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), activated factor VII (VIIa), and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) compared with either control subjects or NIS patients. On the other hand, NIS patients had higher CRP, TGF-β 1, PAI- 1, and factor VIIa, but not F 1 + 2, levels than controls. Significant inverse correlations were observed between the insulin sensitivity index and TGF-β 1, CRP, PAI- 1, factor VIIa, and F 1 + 2 levels. Moreover, significant direct correlations were noted between TGF-β 1 and CRP, PAI- 1, factor VIIa, and F 1 + 2 concentrations. Finally, multiple regressions revealed that TGF-β 1 and the insulin sensitivity index were independently related to F 1 + 2. Our results are the first to document an in vivo relationship between insulin sensitivity and coagulative activation in obesity. The elevated TGF-β 1 levels detected in the obese population may provide a biochemical link between insulin resistance and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{studies have}} {{reported}} conflicting effects of insulin on mixed tissue protein synthesis rates. To test the hypothesis that insulin has differential effects on synthesis rates of various protein fractions in different organs, we infused miniature swine (n � 8 per group) with saline, insulin alone (at 0. 7 mU/kg � 1 � min � 1), or insulin plus an amino acid mixture for 8 h. Fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) in muscle, were measured using L-[1 - 13 C]leucine as a tracer. The FSR of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins were highest in liver, followed by heart and then muscle. Mitochondrial FSR in muscle was higher during insulin and insulin plus amino acid infusions than during saline. <b>Insulin</b> had <b>n...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Pharmacological and {{clinical}} differences between insulin glargine and NPH insulin may translate into differences in patient reported outcomes, but existing data are equivocal. Methods: In this 48 -week, open-label, randomized, multi center, crossover phase IV trial, insulin naïve {{type 2 diabetes}} patients with blood glucose not at target on oral hypoglycemic agents had basal insulin added to their treatment regimen. A total of 343 patients were randomized to either receive insulin glargine (n = 176; sequence A) or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 167; sequence B) in period 1 (weeks 1 – 24) and vice versa in period 2 (weeks 25 – 48). The primary objective was to assess patient reported outcomes using a composite Diabetes Related Quality of Life (DRQoL) score based on an unweighted Insulin Treatment Experience Questionnaire (ITEQ) score, a Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire score, and the mental health score in the Short Form (SF) - 12 ® Health Survey, analyzed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

40|$|OBJECTIVEdPatients {{with the}} {{metabolic}} syndrome (MetS) have impaired insulin-induced enhancement of vasodilator responses. The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1), beyond {{its effects on}} blood glucose, has beneficial actions on vascular function. This study, therefore, aimed to assess whether GLP- 1 affects insulin-stimulated vasodilator reactivity in patients with the MetS. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdForearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in MetS patients {{before and after the}} addition of GLP- 1 to an intra-arterial infusion of saline (n = 5) or <b>insulin</b> (<b>n</b> = 5). The possible involvement of oxidative stress in the vascular effects of GLP- 1 in this setting was investigated by infusion of vitamin C (n = 5). The receptor specificity of GLP- 1 effect during hyperinsulinemia was assessed by infusing its metabolite GLP- 1 (9 - 36) (n = 5). Themetabolic actions of GLP- 1 were also tested by analyzing forearm glucose disposal during hyperinsulinemia (n = 5). RESULTSdIn MetS patients, GLP- 1 enhanced endothelium-dependent and-independent responses to ACh and SNP, respectively, during hyperinsulinemia (P, 0. 001 for both), but not during saline (P. 0. 05 for both). No changes in vasodilator reactivity to ACh and SNP wer...|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWomen with gestational diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to metformin or insulin in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes trial. Fasting maternal plasma glucose, lipids, and CRP were measured at randomization, 36 weeks’ gestation, and 6 – 8 weeks postpartum as well as in cord plasma. Women with available cord blood samples (metformin n = 236, <b>insulin</b> <b>n</b> = 242) were included. RESULTSdMaternal plasma triglycerides increased more from randomization to 36 weeks’ gestation in women treated with metformin (21. 93 %) versus insulin (9. 69 %, P, 0. 001). Ma-ternal and cord plasma lipids, CRP, and neonatal anthropometry did not differ between treat-ments.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} whether insulin detemir is equivalent to insulin glargine in controlling hyperglycemia for the adult hospitalized patient on a basal-bolus treatment regimen. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at two acute care hospitals within the same health system. Patients from both facilities who were initiated on a basal-bolus subcutaneous insulin regimen were included in the study. The basal-bolus regimen consisted of three components: basal, bolus, and corrective insulin with only the data from the first seven days analyzed. Once the basal-bolus protocol was initiated, all previous glycemic agents were discontinued. The target glycemic goal of the study was 100 – 180 mg/dL. RESULTS: In both groups, 50 % of the patients had achieved the target glycemic control goal (100 – 180 mg/dL) by day 2 (p = 0. 3). However, on the seventh or last day of basal-bolus treatment, whichever came first, 36. 36 % of patients receiving <b>insulin</b> detemir (<b>n</b> = 88) achieved the blood glucose reading goal compared to 52. 00 % in patients receiving <b>insulin</b> glargine (<b>n</b> = 100) (p = 0. 03). This corresponded to an adjusted odds ratio of 2. 12 (1. 08 to 4. 15), p = 0. 03. The adjusting variables were provider type, whether the patient was hospitalized within 30 days prior and diagnosis of stroke. The mean blood glucose readings for the insulin glargine and the insulin detemir groups while on basal-bolus therapy were 200 mg/dL and 215 mg/dL, respectively (p = 0. 05). The total number of blood glucose readings less than 70 mg/dL and less than 45 mg/dL was very low and there were no differences in number of episodes with hypoglycemia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: There was not a statistical difference between the two groups at 2 days, however there was on the seventh day or the last day of basal-bolus treatment. There were nonsignificant hypoglycemia events between basal insulin groups and the results for the last or seventh day of treatment may not be clinically significant in practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC) is modulated by 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -DPG). Decreases in 2, 3 -DPG concentration within the red cell shift the curve to the left, whereas increases in concentration cause a shift {{to the right of}} the ODC. Some earlier studies on diabetic patients have reported that insulin treatment may reduce the red cell concentrations of 2, 3 -DPG, causing a shift of the ODC to the left, but the reports are contradictory. Three groups were compared in the present study: 1) nondiabetic control individuals (N = 19); 2) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients (on <b>insulin</b> treatment) (<b>N</b> = 19); 3) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients using oral hypoglycemic agents and no <b>insulin</b> treatment (<b>N</b> = 22). The overall {{position of}} the ODC was the same for the three groups despite an increase of the glycosylated hemoglobin fraction that was expected to shift the ODC to the left in both groups of diabetic patients (HbA 1 c: control, 4. 6 %; IDDM, 10. 5 %; NIDDM, 9. 0 %). In IDDM patients, the effect of the glycosylated hemoglobin fraction on the {{position of the}} ODC appeared to be counterbalanced by small though statistically significant increases in 2, 3 -DPG concentration from 2. 05 (control) to 2. 45 µmol/ml blood (IDDM). Though not statistically significant, an increase of 2, 3 -DPG also occurred in NIDDM patients, while red cell ATP levels were the same for all groups. The positions of the ODC were the same for control subjects, IDDM and NIDDM patients. Thus, the PO 2 at 50 % hemoglobin-oxygen saturation was 26. 8, 28. 2 and 28. 5 mmHg for control, IDDM and NIDDM, respectively. In conclusion, our data question the idea of adverse side effects of insulin treatment on oxygen transport. In other words, the shift to the left reported by others to be caused by insulin treatment was not detected...|$|R
40|$|Background: Resuscitation {{following}} bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular collapse {{is difficult}} and often refractory to conventional treatment. This study was performed to assess the effect of insulin on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular collapse in pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits. Methods: Bupivacaine was administered at 0. 75 mg/kg/min until the heart rate decreased to 65 beats/min. A bolus of regular insulin (2 U/kg) was administered intravenously at the bupivacaine infusion endpoint (BIE) in the <b>insulin</b> group (<b>n</b> = 8), and 2 mL of 0. 9 % NaCl was administered to the control group (n = 8). Results: All animals in the insulin group survived and four animals died in the control group. Arrythymia was rare 10 minutes after the BIE in the insulin group. Conclusions: Bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular collapse can be effectively reversed with an insulin injection, probably through facilitation of cardiac conduction and contraction.
