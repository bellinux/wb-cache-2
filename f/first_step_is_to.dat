The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> exclude other obstructive {{conditions of the}} upper airway, especially epiglottitis, an airway foreign body, subglottic stenosis, angioedema, retropharyngeal abscess, and bacterial tracheitis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mark two {{arbitrary}} {{points of}} the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered {{at one of the}} marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E
5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so {{that they have a}} consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} editing the Papers of James Madison is complex. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> verify {{authenticity}} of the documents. The PJM editors then decide how to represent each document. While some bureaucratic and routine correspondence may be omitted or mentioned in footnotes, the majority of Madison's papers are printed or abstracted in full, to illuminate his thinking and his public and personal life.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} {{foundations of}} the large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The {{next step is to}} build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E

30|$|A {{cross-sectional}} questionnaire {{method was}} utilised. Since {{there are no}} pre-existing standard tools in the literature that assess knowledge and attitudes regarding smoking and smoking cessation, the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> design the questionnaire.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} farm animal using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} either excessive cortisol-like medication such as prednisone or a tumor that either produces or results {{in the production of}} excessive cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cases due to a pituitary adenoma are known as Cushing's disease. It is the second most common cause of Cushing's syndrome after medication. A number of other tumors may also cause Cushing's. Some of these are associated with inherited disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex. Diagnosis requires a number of steps. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> check the medications a person takes. The second step is to measure levels of cortisol in the urine, saliva or in the blood after taking dexamethasone. If this test is abnormal, the cortisol may be measured late at night. If the cortisol remains high, a blood test for ACTH may be done to determine if the pituitary is involved.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E

500|$|Henry tells Emma {{that he has}} a {{plan for}} them to break the curse, called [...] "Operation Cobra". The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{associate}} his book's characters with each of the Storybrooke residents, as no one can remember their past. Henry explains to a skeptical Emma that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Concerned about Henry, Emma goes to see his therapist, Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge). She is willingly given Henry's file, only to be arrested when Archie claims she stole it. Regina unsuccessfully tries to use the incident to divide Emma and Henry. Emma retaliates by attacking Regina's apple tree with a chainsaw, provoking another confrontation.|$|E
