25|$|According to a 2002 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report, about 7,000 {{people were}} {{estimated}} to <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year from medication errors - about 16 percent more deaths {{than the number}} attributable to work-related injuries (6,000 deaths). Medical errors affect one in 10 patients worldwide. One extrapolation suggests that 180,000 people <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year {{partly as a result}} of iatrogenic injury. One in five Americans (22%) report that they or a family member have experienced a medical error of some kind.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the roughly}} 150,000 people who <b>die</b> <b>each</b> day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations, the {{proportion}} is much higher, reaching 90%.|$|E

25|$|Inhaling secondhand {{tobacco smoke}} can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that up to 5 million people <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year from preventable waterborne diseases, {{as a result of}} inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. The effects of sanitation has impacted the society of people throughout history. Sanitation is a necessity for a healthy life.|$|E

25|$|Although SARS {{has killed}} far fewer people than <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year from more common {{maladies}} such as pneumonia, influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, it generated significant attention {{and created a}} sense of urgency to respond because it was a mysterious new illness that seemed able to go anywhere and hit anyone.|$|E

50|$|Nosocomial {{infections are}} {{estimated}} to make patients {{stay in the hospital}} four to five additional days. Around 2004-2005, about 9,000 people <b>died</b> <b>each</b> year with a nosocomial infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without this infection.|$|R
25|$|In humans, ageing {{represents}} {{the accumulation of}} changes in a human being over time, encompassing physical, psychological, and social changes. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom may expand. Ageing is among the greatest known risk factors for most human diseases: of the roughly 150,000 people who <b>die</b> <b>each</b> day across the globe, about two thirds die from age-related causes.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1988, Rather {{hosted a}} CBS News special, The Wall Within. In it, he interviewed six former servicemen, {{each of whom}} said he had {{witnessed}} horrible acts in Vietnam.

25|$|Wildlife {{living near}} the Athabasca River have been greatly {{impacted}} due to pollutants entering the water system. An {{unknown number of}} birds <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year. Particularly visible and hard hit are migrating birds that stop to rest at tailing ponds. There have been numerous reports of large flocks of ducks landing in tailing ponds and perishing soon after.

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimate}} that vaccination averts 2-3 million deaths per year (in all age groups), {{and up to}} 1.5 million children <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year due to diseases {{which could have been}} prevented by vaccination. They {{estimate that}} 29% of deaths of children under five years old in 2013 were vaccine preventable. In other developing parts of the world, they are faced with the challenge of having a decreased availability of resources and vaccinations. Countries such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford to provide the full range of childhood vaccinations.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reliable}} reporting system in place and because most victims never report their injury to health care facilities, these numbers are uncertain. One comprehensive study estimates that 91,000 to 420,000 snake envenomings occur in sub-Saharan Africa annually, resulting in anywhere from 4,000 to 30,000 deaths. The same study estimates that 3,000 to 80,000 envenomations occur in North Africa, although far fewer people, less than 100, <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year. The variability of these estimates {{is indicative of the}} difficulty in accurately assessing snakebite morbidity and mortality.|$|E
25|$|There are {{approximately}} 120 million smokers in India. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India {{is home to}} 12% of the world’s smokers. More than 1 million <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year due to tobacco in India. According to a 2002 WHO estimate, 30% of adult males in India smoke. Among adult females, the figure is much lower at between 3–5%. About 24% of {{children under the age}} of 16 years (10th class) have used some form of tobacco in the past, and 14% are still using tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco is more prevalent than cigarettes or bidis in India.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} year of their stay in the camp, from August 1940 to August 1941, roughly 47 women died. During the last year of the camp's existence, about 80 inmates <b>died</b> <b>each</b> day from disease or famine related causes.|$|R
50|$|The report quotes {{media reports}} {{as saying that}} 2.1 million American women on average were {{assaulted}} by men each year. Three females were murdered by their partner each day, and four females <b>died</b> <b>each</b> day {{as a result of}} abuse.|$|R
50|$|Singapore was a {{successful}} trading centre. Large numbers of immigrants came, hoping to make their fortune here. The majority of immigrants were poor and destitute. Malnutrition was common and {{it was estimated that}} about 100 immigrants <b>died</b> <b>each</b> year from starvation.|$|R
25|$|However, many {{challenges}} remain. Only about {{one half of}} the population is connected to sanitary sewers. Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 50,000 children <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year because of diarrhea. Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world. This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs, a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring. Poor operation of facilities, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, as well as limited government accountability and transparency, are also issues.|$|E
25|$|Documented deaths {{resulting}} from snake bites are uncommon. Nonfatal bites from venomous snakes {{may result in}} the need for amputation of a limb or part thereof. Of the roughly 725 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 250 are able to kill a human with one bite. Australia averages only one fatal snake bite per year. In India, 250,000 snakebites are recorded in a single year, {{with as many as}} 50,000 recorded initial deaths. The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.|$|E
25|$|Horseback riding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually. On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses. 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries. Of those, about 60 <b>die</b> <b>each</b> year from their brain injuries. Studies have found horseback riding to be more dangerous than several sports, including skiing, auto racing and football. Horseback riding has a higher hospital admittance rate per hours of riding than motorcycle racing, at 0.49 per thousand hours of riding and 0.14 accidents per thousand hours, respectively.|$|E
