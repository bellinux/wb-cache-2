The oscillators function respectively {{to generate a}} reference frequency, f(r), and to generate an initial frequency, f(0), which when mixed produce a difference equal to zero. Upon connecting an inductor of small unknown value in the LC circuit to change its resonant frequency to f(x), a difference frequency (f(r) -f(x)) is produced that is very nearly a linear function of the inductance of the inductor. The difference frequency is measured and displayed on a linear scale in units of inductance...|$|E

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of partially saturated inductors in Switching Mode Power Supply (SMPS) {{is a key}} strategy for reducing the size of SMPS and increasing their power density [1]. However an accurate characterization and modellization of each inductor is needed for a correct design {{and control of the}} SMPS [2]. Most of inductors’ datasheets only indicate the nominal inductance at low current. Anyway, when the inductor is subjected to a higher current, the value of the inductance is lessened. Moreover, <b>inductance</b> <b>meters</b> often actuate their measurements at no or moderate DC bias. In this work we describe the realization of an automated test bench (Fig. 1) for characterizing an inductor under variable current levels, moving its operating point form the linear region to the partial saturation region [3]. The core of the measurement setup is a simple buck converter, used for applying a square wave voltage to the inductor under test (Fig. 1). The current flowing through the inductor is measured by a Hall-effect current transducer. In order to measure the inductance at different values of the DC bias current, a constant current sink is placed after the LC filter as a variable load. The measurement is carried out by exploiting the inductor constitutive equation VL = L dIL/dt, rewritten as: L = VL / (dIL/dt). For small current variations, the value of L can be considered constant and depending only on the average current. The DC bias current, the frequency and duty-cycle of the switching element can be controlled by a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW, which also takes care of data acquisition and post elaboration (Fig. 2). Several inductors have been tested using the described setup. Figure 3 shows a typical plot of the inductance L versus the inductor current IL. The inductor under test has a rated value of 470 μH. The partial saturation of the inductor is quite evident. Reproducibility tests have been performed on the system, by comparing the results of several measurements on the same inductor. Standard deviation bars, indicated in the plot, show the acceptable precision of the method, the results being well within 1...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{electrical}} properties of graphite materials as the mechanical treatment result with high energy milling (HEM) techniques was carried out. The carbon powder was milled using HEM by varying the milling time from 25 hours to 100 hours, and afterwards the graphite material {{was formed to}} a pellet under compaction up to 20 ton/cm 2. The measurements result {{of electrical}} properties using LCR (<b>Inductance,</b> Capacitance, Resistance) <b>meter</b> showed that milling process to graphite causes the increasing of conductivity and capacitance values and these values were increasing {{with the increase of}} milling times. Before milling, the conductivity value is 3. 5976 Siemens/cm and the value of capacitance is 0. 2223 μF at 100 kHz frequence. Increasing of conductivity value reached 26 % and capacitance value reached 66 % after milling for 100 hours. These incresing are analized due to decreasing of graphite powder particle size causing by longer milling time and result in higher electrical conductivity...|$|R
40|$|Montmorillonite (MMT) -filled {{brominated}} epoxy hybrid composites {{used for}} {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) are successfully prepared by in-situ polymerization by a careful choice of fabrication process. The characteristics of the composite are assessed by <b>Inductance</b> Capacitance Resistance <b>meter</b> (LCR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Thermal Mechanical Analysis (TMA) and a universal tester. The dielectric study reveals that the incorporation of MMT filler into epoxy significantly reduces (i. e. by up to 36 %) the dissipation factor, with a marginal reduction in the dielectric constant. The hybrid composites also exhibit better thermo-mechanical properties. With regard to thermal stability, {{the introduction of a}} small amount of MMT leads to an improvement in the glass transition temperature (T g), a marked decrease in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) at different temperature ranges, particularly above T g, and a slight improvement in the mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and tensile strength. We observe a negligible trend but good resistance for moisture absorption compared with unmodified epoxy resin systems. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

Effects of J-rays on the electrical conductivity of the composite polymer films had been investigated by using <b>Inductance</b> Capacitance Resistance <b>meter</b> (LCR) meter at a frequency ranging from 20 Hz to 1 MHz.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that an electric field (inductance) produced by charged blood components {{passing through the}} many branches of arteries and veins could assess total blood volume (TBV) or plasma volume (PV). Individual (N = 29) electrical circuits (inductors, two resistors, and a capacitor) were determined from bioelectrical response spectroscopy (BERS) using a Hewlett Packard 4284 A Precision LCR <b>Meter.</b> <b>Inductance,</b> capacitance, and resistance from the circuits of 19 subjects modeled TBV (sum of PV and computed red cell volume) and PV (based on 125 I-albumin). Each model (N = 10, cross validation group) had good validity based on 1) mean differences (- 2. 3 to 1. 5 %) between the methods that were not significant and less than the propagated errors (+/- 5. 2 % for TBV and PV), 2) high correlations (r > 0. 92) with low SEE (< 7. 7 %) between dilution and BERS assessments, and 3) Bland-Altman pairwise comparisons that indicated "clinical equivalency" between the methods. Given the {{limitation of this study}} (10 validity subjects), we concluded that BERS models accurately assessed TBV and PV.

40|$|A LCR <b>meter</b> (<b>Inductance</b> (L), Capacitance (C), and Resistance (R)) is a {{piece of}} {{electronic}} test equipment used to measure, among other things, the impedance (inductance, capacitance, resistance) of a component. Currently some models of LRC meters are there. They are very costly but have good precision. But the controversy between the precision and the cost will be the most important consideration if we take it as an instrument. Because this is obvious that if we need a good precision we need more and more complex circuits and also we need more research component to get that much precision. So cost of the instrument will be high according to that precision. But other way we do not more accurate values all the time. If we take an ordinary electronic workshop/lab which is centered at a university or college there are so many practical need much more accurate measurements. So, the major percentage of practical need the matter, which the students should ensure that the vale printed in the label is correct or not before they deploy the component in circuit. Our motivation is to develop a circuit which low cost as well as acceptable precision. So, we think it will be good product for the normal laboratory measurements in a low cost. Every electronic or electrical laboratory should have meter like this to ensure the component values. In the normal LRC meters, usually the device under test (DUT) is subjected to an AC voltage source, then the voltage over, and the current through the DUT are measured. The measured impedance consists of real and complex components. The phase angle (Φ) also is an important parameter, digital instruments are gaining popularity over their analog counterparts due to their high accuracy, high input impedance, small in size and weight, along with this type provide other facilities like auto zeroing, auto ranging as well as auto power off and power down mode in large digital instruments Accurately our end product has the facility to measure the inductance, capacitance and resistance with auto ranging. It takes the normal AC power supply and display the measurements in a LCD display with units...|$|R
