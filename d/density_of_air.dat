5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at sea level).|$|E
25|$|Silica aerogel is {{the most}} common type of aerogel, and the most {{extensively}} studied and used. It is silica-based and can be derived from silica gel or by a modified Stober process. The lowest-density silica nanofoam weighs 1,000g/m3, which is the evacuated version of the record-aerogel of 1,900g/m3. The <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is 1,200g/m3 (at 20°C and 1atm). , aerographene had a lower density at 160g/m3, or 13% the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{issue in}} open circuit scuba diver weighting {{is that the}} breathing gas is used up during a dive, and this gas has weight, so the total weight of the cylinder decreases, while its volume remains almost unchanged. As the diver needs to be neutral {{at the end of}} the dive, particularly at shallow depths for obligatory or safety decompression stops, sufficient ballast weight must be carried to allow for this reduction in weight of gas supply. (the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at normal atmospheric pressure is approximately 1.2kg/m3, or approximately 0.075lb/ft3) The amount of weight needed to compensate for gas use is easily calculable once the free gas volume and density are known.|$|E

25|$|As {{aircraft}} {{began to}} travel faster, aerodynamicists {{realized that the}} <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> began to change as it {{came into contact with}} an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and compressible regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow which included Schlieren photography techniques to visualize the changes in density. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave. Jakob Ackeret led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.|$|E

Most full-sized diving cylinders used for open circuit scuba hold more than [...] of air when full, and as the air is used, the buoyancy of the cylinder increases by the weight removed. The decrease in external volume of the cylinder due to reduction of internal pressure is relatively small, and can be ignored for practical purposes.|$|E

500|$|Cold fronts and {{occluded}} fronts generally {{move from}} west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because {{of the greater}} <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions.

[...] When a front becomes [...] stationary, and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. [...] This is most common over the open ocean.|$|E
500|$|Neon is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>air.</b> It was discovered (along with krypton and xenon) in 1898 {{as one of}} the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered, and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. The name neon is derived from the Greek word, , neuter singular form of [...] (neos), meaning new. Neon is chemically inert and no uncharged neon compounds are known. The compounds of neon currently known include ionic molecules, molecules held together by van der Waals forces and clathrates.|$|E
