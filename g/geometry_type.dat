40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of tibial stem geometry on stress shielding of the tibia for patients with a total knee replacement. Finite element analysis was used to study different tibial stem <b>geometry</b> <b>types,</b> as well as a vast array of different geometric sizes. Both a peg and stem <b>type</b> <b>geometry</b> were analyzed and compared in order to determine what <b>type</b> <b>geometry</b> causes the least amount of stress shielding. A static loading condition with a dynamic loading factor of three was used for the system and the stress responses were analyzed at regions of interest at various depths. Regions of interest include the posterior and medial regions, at depths ranging from the resurfaced tibial surface to 100 mm below the surface. It was found that the smallest stem/peg sizes produced the least amount of stress shielding, indicating that the less amount of foreign material within the tibia, the more natural the bending and stress response of the tibia. It was also concluded that for the loading conditions used in this study, peg <b>type</b> <b>geometry</b> yields a decreased amount of stress shielding when compared to stem <b>type</b> <b>geometry.</b> This is due to the fact that the peg <b>type</b> <b>geometry</b> allowed for more natural bending and a distributed loading transfer between two pegs rather than one long central stem.

The Fukui testing involved both deformation drawing and stretching. The elastic and plastic material properties are testing with plane stress and axis symmetric. There are three types of material aluminium, brass and steel are used to this project. The project begins with die design with AutoCAD and Solidworks. The project is further to modeling finite element with Algor FEA. The simulation started with elastic and plastic material model with plane stress.

40|$|Several {{application}} contexts {{require the}} ability to use together and compare different geographic datasets (maps) concerning the same or overlapping areas. This is for example the case of mediator systems, integrating distinct data sources for query processing, and GISs dealing with multiresolution maps. In both cases, distinct maps may represent the same geographic feature with different <b>geometry</b> <b>type</b> (a road can be a region in one map and a line in another one). An important issue is therefore determining whether two multi-resolution maps are consistent, i. e., they represent the same area without contradictions, and, if not, if they are at least similar. In this paper we consider consistency and similarity of multi-resolution maps with respect to topological information. Existing approaches do not take feature <b>geometry</b> <b>type</b> into account. In this paper, we extend them with two notions of topological consistency, the first requiring the same topological relation between pairs of common features, the second ‘relaxing ’ the first one by considering similarity between topological relations. A similarity function for multi-resolution maps is then provided, taking into account both feature geometry types and topological relations of map objects. We finally discuss how the proposed consistency and similarity concepts can be significantly used in GIS applications. Some experimental results are also reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

The results show that tubes with cor-rugations have a higher mean crushing force which is directly proportional to the number of corrugations and their amplitudes.

Finally, it was found that corrugated tubes are more effective in lateral direction as energy absorbers, as they present suitable force–deflection responses...|$|E
