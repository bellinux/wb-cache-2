25|$|In metal borides, {{the bonding}} of boron varies {{depending}} on the atomic ratio B/M. Diborides have B/M = 2, as in the well-known superconductor MgB2; they crystallize in a hexagonal AlB2-type layered structure. Hexaborides have B/M = 6 and form a three-dimensional boron framework based on a boron octahedron (Fig. 1a). Tetraborides, i.e. B/M = 4, are mixtures of diboride and hexaboride structures. Cuboctahedron (Fig. 1b) is the structural unit of dodecaborides, which have a cubic lattice and B/M = 12. When the composition ratio exceeds 12, boron forms B12 icosahedra (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1c)</b> which are linked into a three-dimensional boron framework, and the metal atoms reside in the voids of this framework.|$|E
25|$|In muscle tissue, 10-100 endomysium-sheathed {{muscle fibers}} are {{organized}} into perimysium-wrapped bundles known as fascicles. Each muscle {{is composed of}} a number of fascicles grouped together by a sleeve of connective tissue, known as an epimysium. In a pennate muscle, aponeuroses run along each side of the muscle and attach to the tendon. The fascicles attach to the aponeuroses and form an angle (the pennation angle) to the load axis of the muscle. If all the fascicles are {{on the same side of}} the tendon, the pennate muscle is called unipennate (Fig. 1A). Examples of this include certain muscles in the hand. If there are fascicles on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate muscle is called bipennate (Fig. 1B). The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical. If the central tendon branches within a pennate muscle, the muscle is called multipennate (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1C),</b> as seen in the deltoid muscle in the shoulder.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{intensive}} research which {{has been carried out}} on the kidney, little is actually known about the ultrastructure of the brush border. This preliminary note refers to a structural detail of the brush border found in the proximal convolution of the nephrons in normal mouse kidney, as studied under the electron microscope. Normal mice were decapitated and immediately afterwards the kidney was exposed, stripped from its capsule, and a thin slice of its cortex was fixed for electron microscopy (Palade, 1952). The rest of the technique was routine. The material was examined at a Siemens electron microscope t~M 100 b model. Micrographs were taken at original enlargements of 1, 200, 7, 200, and 15, 000. The appearance of the brush border of all cells is basically the same as described by different authors (Sj 6 strand and Rhodin, 1953; P, hodin, 1954; Pease, 1955; Policard, 1957; and others), with the exception that in a few digitations (microvilli) of some brush borders, infoldings of the membrane (Fig. 1, A) and vesicles (Fig. 1, B) with an apparently dense content can be visualized. These vesicles, which measure about 200 A, are disposed along the middle of the units of the brush border (<b>Figs.</b> <b>1,C</b> and 1,D). <b>Fig.</b> 3, at A, shows the same aspect in a somewhat less marked form.

50|$|The {{principle}} of the ΔΣ architecture is explained at length in section 2. Initially, when a sequence starts, the circuit will have an arbitrary state which {{is dependent on the}} integral of all previous history. In mathematical terms this corresponds to the arbitrary integration constant of the indefinite integral. This follows from the fact that {{at the heart of the}} method there is an integrator which can have any arbitrary state dependent on previous input, see <b>Fig.</b> <b>1c</b> (d). From the occurrence of the first pulse onward the frequency of the pulse stream is proportional to the input voltage to be transformed. A demonstration applet is available online to simulate the whole architecture.|$|E
50|$|One {{would expect}} that {{enrichment}} of heavy isotopes leads to progressively slower reactions, but the IsoRes hypothesis suggests that there exist certain resonance compositions for which kinetics increases even for higher abundances of heavy stable isotopes. For example, at 9.5% 13C, 10.9% 15N and 6.6% 18O (when all three elements are 10-35 times enriched compared to their natural abundances) and normal deuterium composition (150 ppm or 0.015%), a very strong resonance (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1C)</b> is predicted (“super-resonance”).Yet another nontrivial prediction of the IsoRes hypothesis is that at ≈250-350 ppm deuterium content, the terrestrial resonance becomes “perfect”, and the rates of biochemical reactions and growth of terrestrial organisms further increase. This prediction seems to be matched by at least some experimental observations.|$|E
50|$|A {{circuit diagram}} for a {{practical}} implementation is illustrated, Fig 1b {{and the associated}} waveforms <b>Fig.</b> <b>1c.</b> This circuit diagram is mainly for illustration purposes, details of particular manufacturers implementations will usually be available from the particular manufacturer. A scrap view of an alternative front end is shown in Fig. 1b which has the advantage that the voltage at the switch terminals are relatively constant and close to 0.0 V. Also the current generated through R by −Vref is constant at −Vref/R so that much less noise is radiated to adjacent parts of the circuit. Then {{this would be the}} preferred front end in practice but, in order to show the impulse as a voltage pulse so as to be consistent with previous discussion, the front end given here, which is an electrical equivalent, is used.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Here are two {{relative}} size illusions {{described by}} Italian visual researcher Gianni A. Sarcone in 1997 and 2013. The first relative-size illusion called Sarcone’s Crosses contradicts Ebbinghaus illusion (aka Titchener Circles, 1898) and Obonai square illusion (1954). Sarcone's cross illusion {{consists of a}} cross (the test shape) surrounded by sets of squares of distinct size (the inducing shapes). As shown in the diagram, the three blue crosses in fig. 1.a, 1.b and 1.c {{are exactly the same}} size; {{the one on the left}} (fig. 1.a), however, appears larger. The illusion works even when the small squares completely occlude the blue cross (see <b>fig.</b> <b>1.c).</b> In conclusion, there isn’t always correlation between the size of the surrounding shapes and the relative size perception of the test shape.In fig. 2.a and 2.b, by effect of assimilation, the diagonal red line within the large ellipse seems subjectively longer, but in fact the blue line is objectively the longest of both lines.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{conclude}} that HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) increase histone acetylation and improve synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (Fig 1A). CREB, a cAMP response element-binding protein and transcriptional activator, binds CBP forming the CREB: CBP complex. This complex activates genes involved in synaptic formation and long-term memory.(Fig 1B) TSA treatments in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice increased acetylation levels and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism involved in learning and memory (Fig 1B). However, TSA treatments in CBP mutants lacking KIX domains did not effect LTP in mice (Fig 1D). The KIX domain allows for interaction between CREB and CBP, so knocking out this region disrupts {{formation of the}} CREB: CBP complex. Knock outs of CREB produced similar results to those of mutant CBP mice (<b>Fig</b> <b>1C).</b> Therefore, HDAC inhibition and CREB: CBP association are both necessary for memory development. TSA treatments showed increased expression levels of Nr4a1 and Nra2 genes while other CREB regulated genes were unaffected. HDAC inhibitors improve memory through activation of specific genes regulated by CREB: CBP complex.|$|E
5000|$|Figure 3 is a {{schematic}} {{drawing of a}} travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine. It consists of a resonator tube and a loop which contains a regenerator, three heat exchangers, and a bypass loop. A regenerator is a porous medium with a high heat capacity. As the gas flows {{back and forth through}} the regenerator, it periodically stores and takes up heat from the regenerator material. In contrast to the stack, the pores in the regenerator are much smaller than the thermal penetration depth, so the thermal contact between gas and material is very good. Ideally, the energy flow in the regenerator is zero, so the main energy flow in the loop is from the hot heat exchanger via the pulse tube and the bypass loop to the heat exchanger at {{the other side of the}} regenerator (main heat exchanger). The energy in the loop is transported via a travelling wave as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1c,</b> hence the name travelling-wave systems. The ratio of the volume flows at the ends of the regenerator is TH/Ta, so the regenerator acts as a volume-flow amplifier.Just like in the case of the standing-wave system, the machine [...] "spontaneously" [...] produces sound if the temperature TH is high enough. The resulting pressure oscillations can be used in a variety of ways, such as in producing electricity, cooling, and heat pumping.|$|E
50|$|Under natural {{conditions}} {{a prerequisite for}} an optimal tissue development is a cell-specific interaction with the extracellular matrix, while under in vitro conditions {{a substitute for the}} extracellular matrix has to be selected. However, the crucial problem is that a biomaterial can influence the development of functional features within a maturing tissue in a good and in a bad sense. In consequence, the suitability of a decellularized extracellular matrix, newly developed synthetic polymers, biodegradable scaffolds, ceramics or metal alloys cannot be predicted but must be tested. To meet parameters positively influencing cell adhesion and communication, the technical concept is based on a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1). By the help of this tool cell adhesion and development of tissue can be tested with individually selected biomaterials. These experiments can be performed first under static (Fig. 2) and then under dynamic (Fig. 3) culture conditions 6. In both cases a Minusheet tissue carrier prevents damage but supports development of contained cells or tissues during experimentation. To stay compatible with a conventional 24 well culture plate a selected biomaterial must be punched in a diameter of 13 mm. In this format many materials are also commercially available. Further materials can be applied in form of filters, foils, nets, fleeces and scaffolds (Fig. 1a). For an easy handling and to prevent damage during development the selected specimens are placed in the base part of a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1b). Pressing down a tension ring the biomaterial is held in position (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1c).</b> After mounting a tissue carrier is enveloped in a bag and sterilized.|$|E
