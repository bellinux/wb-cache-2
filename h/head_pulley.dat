50|$|A {{centrifugal}} discharge elevator may be vertical or inclined. Vertical elevators depend {{entirely on}} the action of centrifugal force to get the material into the discharge chute and must be run at speeds relatively high. Inclined elevators with buckets spaced apart or set close together may have the discharge chute set partly under the <b>head</b> <b>pulley.</b> Since they don't depend {{entirely on the}} centrifugal force to put the material into the chute, the speed may be relatively lower.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside bucket elevators, floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside bucket elevators can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the <b>head</b> <b>pulley</b> section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These bucket elevators must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a one-hour fire resistance rating and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the various methods available to predict the discharge angle of material as it leaves the <b>head</b> <b>pulley</b> of a conveyor belt. This discharge angle prediction is a vital component in the overall determination of the discharge trajectory of material and as a result will dictate the design of a transfer chute to adequately feed downstream components in a system. The discharge angle will also dictate the location of a stockpile if this is the desired application of the conveyor belt. Included in this paper are numerical comparisons of the methods presented to quantify similarities and differences between individual approaches by using a range of belt speeds and pulley diameters. Observations made on the various methods will be discussed, including advantages, disadvantages and limitations...|$|E

40|$|From {{transportation}} of bulk materials in underground and open-cut mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to name but a few, belt conveyors {{are widely used}} as an economical continuous conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on conveyor transfers to divert material from one conveyor to another {{at some point in}} their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being made and the incorrect conveyor transfer being installed with flow-on effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement. There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise, dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining the material discharge and trajectory from the <b>head</b> <b>pulley</b> is the first step in this design process. This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory as it leaves the belt conveyor <b>head</b> <b>pulley.</b> This process will also determine the point at which the material leaves the belt, referred to as the discharge angle. There are numerous methods available in the literature focusing on the modelling of material discharge and trajectory, including C. E. M. A. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], M. H. E. A. [6, 7], Booth [8], Golka [9, 10], Korzen [11], Goodyear [12] and Dunlop [13]. These methods have been evaluated for both horizontal and inclined belts for a range of belt speeds and pulley diameters to evaluate both low and high-speed conditions. The results of these evaluations have been compared to allow comment on their ease of use, completeness and potential accuracy...|$|E
40|$|We {{are rapidly}} {{approaching}} {{the time when}} zero carryback will be demanded by the environmentalists and OSHA. The carryback in reference is the fines that cling to the conveyor belt after the belt's cargo has been discharged over the <b>head</b> <b>pulley.</b> Having resisted the centrifugal force to be thrown off with the cargo, these fines are sticky enough {{to remain on the}} belt. As the belt returns to the tail pulley, the idlers that support the belt and the pulleys that bend the belt, dislodge this carried back material, causing it to fall and collect in piles and the very fine particles to become airborne. Recently I visited a plant that had a 42 " wide conveyor belt carrying lignite from storage into the plant. An engineer was assigned to make a study determining if the fugitive material that was creating the "DURT" " problem was coming from the belt, and if it was, what to do about it. He was undecided if it was fugitive because of carryback or because of wind effect as the wind swept across the conveyor. If indeed the problem was from wind effect, a gallery would have to be built to enclose the conveyor. Assisting in this investigation, 1 placed a carryback gauge against the bottom of the return strand of the conveyor belt near the <b>head</b> <b>pulley.</b> This gauge is a measuring device with blades that will scrape a one inch wide area when pressed against the moving belt. Any particles clinging to the belt are scraped off and collected in the container of the device. The carryback gauge was placed against the belt at three different locations across the width of the belt; in the center and 10 inches left and right of center. The removed carryback material was measured. It was found to be an average of. 08 ounces in a 10 second period. The belt was traveling at 592 feet per minute...|$|E
40|$|Bucket {{elevators}} outwardly {{appear to}} be simple devices. However having a bucket bolted to a flexible belt creates difficulties at the interface of the belt, bucket and <b>head</b> <b>pulley.</b> At the point where a bucket's connection line becomes tangent to the pulley, {{the tip of the}} bucket must undergo a very rapid acceleration phase; theoretically infinite. In reality, as the point of tangency is reached, the tip of the bucket lags behind its theoretical position before accelerating and overshooting its nominally correct position. The motion of an empty bucket is a decaying damped oscillation. When the bucket is transporting bulk material then more complex motion occurs. This paper presents preliminary results of an investigation utilising Discrete Element modelling tools to better understand the impact of the transition point on the discharge pattern from the bucket. We anticipate that this will lead {{to a better understanding of}} structural fatigue of the belt carcass and provide a better understanding of the interacting mechanisms at work in bucket elevator systems...|$|E
40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} {{are commonly}} used in a multitude of industries to transport material from one location to another. Belt conveyors can be configured in many ways, from a single run which might form a stockpile, to many interconnected belt conveyors, necessitating the use of transfers to successfully deliver material through the system. Whichever method applies, {{the way in which}} material leaves the head of a conveyor will dictate the path the flow of material takes to {{the next step in the}} process. Many installations run successfully with systems that have been in operation for many years, however not all have been ‘engineered’, instead relying on a rule-of-thumb approach by experienced and long serving staff. The research presented in this paper focuses on the material trajectory as it leaves the <b>head</b> <b>pulley</b> of a belt conveyor, from: an experimental perspective; predictions made by applying a variety of numerical trajectory models; and the use of the discrete element method (DEM). Comparisons will be made between these three methods to establish whether the numerical models or the DEM simulations can successfully predict the experimental particle trajectories...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} seven material discharge trajectory {{methods and}} explains {{the differences between}} them. Most of these methods involve a series of equations to determine first whether low-speed or high-speed conveying condition apply, then the material discharge angle for low-speed conditions and finally the X and Y coordinates of the trajectory profile. There are also simplified methods which rely on graphical determination of the trajectory profiles. The methods have been analysed to investigate which included parameters can be declared as variables for a given conveying condition and then evaluated to determine {{the impact of the}} variations. These parameters include, adhesive stress, coefficients of static and kinetic friction, air drag, particle shape and size, divergent coefficients and material bulk density.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of discrete element simulations applied to a bucket elevator model with particular reference to the <b>head</b> <b>pulley</b> transition zone. This is the first stage in a larger study to better understand the mechanics of bucket elevator operation with reference to the discharge of particles at the head end. At the head end two issues arise; mechanically, the buckets are bolted to the conveying media (typically a fabric reinforced belt) and at the point of belt to headpulley tangency, the tip of the bucket undergoes a theoretical step change in velocity. This theoretical step change results in a classical under-damped response in the buckets tip velocity. In undergoing this motion, there are stresses that are passed to the carcass of the conveying media; understanding the magnitude of these stresses is one longer term goal of this research allowing a quantitative basis for the existing qualitative design guidelines such as (Handbook for conveyor and elevator belting, Apex Belting Pty Ltd). The discharge of the bulk material from the bucket has been addressed Beverly et al. (Bulk Solids Handling, 1983) but this analysis is dependent on simple, but common, bucket geometry and ignores the initial transition to the headpulley. Ignoring the transition with a low speed discharge elevator is not likely to impact on the predicted discharge pattern, however with high speed discharge elevators, the destabilising effect of the transition is expected to promote premature discharge of bulk material from the bucket. Depending on the design of the elevator casing this early discharge may or may not impact on the overall conveying efficiency...|$|E
