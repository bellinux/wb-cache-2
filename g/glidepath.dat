25|$|Flight 910 had {{canceled}} its IFR clearance earlier, flying VFR {{during its}} final flight segment, and received landing clearance for Runway 13. The First Officer, {{seated on the}} right, was flying the aircraft, and was guiding it down the ILS <b>glidepath</b> and localizer, while maintaining visual contact with the ground. The crew could hear the tower give instructions to a light aircraft nearby.|$|E
25|$|Delta Air Lines Flight 723 was a Douglas DC-9 {{twin-engine}} jetliner, {{operating as}} a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, with an intermediate stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. On July 31, 1973 at 11:08AM, while on an ILS instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the <b>glidepath,</b> struck a seawall with a landing gear and crashed, killing {{all but two}} of its 89 occupants. Both survivors later died of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make control inputs to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the <b>glidepath</b> to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
2500|$|The BS-1 is {{constructed}} entirely from fiberglass and features an [...] wing with flaps and dive brakes. For further <b>glidepath</b> control the BS-1 has a tail-mounted parachute. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 779 {{took off}} from Anchorage at 19:40 en route to Shemya on an {{instrument}} flight plan. [...] At 00:45 the flight radioed Shemya air traffic control; reporting their position as 55° 46' North and 179° 08' East {{at an altitude of}} 10,000 feet. [...] The flight was 100 miles from Shemya 43 minutes later. [...] At 01:45 the flight made radar contact with the airport, at an altitude of 5,500 feet and 18 miles north-northeast of the destination. [...] The air traffic controller reported that the flight entered the <b>glidepath</b> and stayed on the correct approach for runway 10, but two miles from touchdown the flight was 10–15 feet below the ideal <b>glidepath,</b> so he instructed the crew to [...] ""ease the aircraft up"; but the crew failed to correct the position. [...] One mile from touchdown the aircraft was 30–40 feet below the <b>glidepath,</b> to which the controller again instructed the flight crew to [...] "bring the aircraft up." [...] Despite the warnings the flight still maintained the current path with no corrections to the altitude. [...] The flight was still above the minimum safe altitude, and when the flight began to descend rapidly the controller assumed that the pilots switched to a visual approach. [...] At 02:11 Alaska time the flight crashed 200 feet short of the runway in Shemya, killing all six crew members on board.|$|E
2500|$|The SF-24 is {{constructed}} with a welded steel tube fuselage that mounts the monowheel landing gear, {{with a small}} tail wheel for ground maneuvering. The wings and tail surfaces are built with wooden structures and covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing has a [...] span, employs an Mu 14% airfoil and mounts spoilers for <b>glidepath</b> control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction, with a welded steel tube fuselage covered in doped aircraft fabric covering, wooden framed tail surfaces covered in fabric and wooden wings. The [...] span wing uses a NACA 63-616 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a NACA 63-614 section at the wing tip. The wing uses dive brakes for <b>glidepath</b> control. The nose {{is covered with}} fibreglass. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|Another major {{difference}} was {{a conclusion that}} Russian air traffic control {{played a part in}} the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position. ATC gave distance callouts on average [...] in advance, and told the aircraft it was on the correct <b>glidepath</b> when it actually was not. Furthermore, the controllers gave the [...] "Level 101" [...] command ten seconds after the aircraft passed the [...] altitude where such call was supposed to be given.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controls}} are conventional, {{with a stick}} for ailerons and elevator and rudder pedals. The aircraft uses flaps for <b>glidepath</b> control, which function as airbrakes when set to 45-70 degrees. A ballistic parachute with an area of [...] is also fitted. The aircraft can be rigged for flight by one person in 15 minutes. It has been launched by foot, aero-tow, bungee launch, auto-tow and winch-launch and has been landed on its wheel and foot-landed as well.|$|E
2500|$|The 604 is {{constructed}} from fibreglass. The wing employs a modified Wortmann FX 67-K-170 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a Wortmann FX 67-K-150 at the wing tip. The wing features six flaps, with the outer pair {{moving at a}} 2:1 differential ratio with the ailerons. For <b>glidepath</b> control the 604 has wing top-surface spoilers and a tail-mounted drag chute. The aircraft can carry [...] of water ballast. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from wood {{and covered in}} doped aircraft fabric covering. The glider has a detachable pod to cover the pilot or can be flown open cockpit. It has a constant chord wing with a [...] chord and a [...] span. The wing features dual parallel struts and jury struts, but has no spoilers or other <b>glidepath</b> control devices. The tailplane is also strut-braced. Unlike most earlier primary glider designs that land on a fixed skid, this aircraft has a fixed monowheel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{the first}} full year of operation, the airport handled 133,000 passengers. The {{earliest}} scheduled flights were operated to and from Plymouth, Paris, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. With a runway of only [...] in length, and a slope of the <b>glidepath</b> of 7.5° (for noise abatement reasons), the airport could only be used by a very limited number of aircraft types, principally the Dash 7 and the smaller Dornier Do 228. In 1989 the airport submitted a planning application to extend the runway, allowing {{the use of a}} larger number of aircraft types.|$|E
2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway {{and whether or not they}} were on the <b>glidepath.</b> The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the <b>glidepath</b> when it was not.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the probable cause for the accident was excessive flight speed and the steep angle of the <b>glidepath</b> (7 degrees, {{as opposed to the}} 3 degrees normally used for both visual and instrument approaches), and the flight crew's failure to abort the approach when conditions were not met for a stable approach and landing. The action of the flight controller was listed as a contributing factor in the accident: [...] "Contributing to the accident was the controller's positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flight crew other than a go-around maneuver." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{final report}} into the crash was {{released}} on June 24, 2014. The NTSB found that the [...] "Mismanagement of Approach and Inadequate Monitoring of Airspeed led to the Crash of Asiana flight 214". The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired <b>glidepath.</b> In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode, which, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired glide path with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} design was simplified for homebuilt construction, retaining {{the wood and}} fabric wing construction, but the fuselage was changed to a fiberglass structure. The wingspan was shortened to [...] to allow the wings {{to be built in}} a standard [...] deep garage. Unlike on the {{original design}}, roll control was changed to ailerons, with upper surface spoilers paired with lower surface dive brakes for <b>glidepath</b> control. Because the aircraft is tailless the centre of gravity range is very narrow. To simplify weight and balance considerations the monowheel landing gear is located on the desired C of G and the pilot's seat is adjustable fore-and-aft. The pilot simply moves the seat until the aircraft balances on the wheel to ensure that the balance is within the center-of-gravity range. The empty weight is [...] with a gross weight of [...] The aircraft manages a 35:1 glide ratio and a minimum sink of [...]|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of IAPs: {{precision}} approach (PA), approach with vertical guidance (APV), and nonprecision approach (NPA). A PA uses a navigation system that provides course and <b>glidepath</b> deviation. Examples include precision approach radar (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), and GBAS landing system (GLS). An APV also uses a navigation system for course and <b>glidepath</b> deviation, just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include baro-VNAV, localizer type directional aid (LDA) with <b>glidepath,</b> LNAV/VNAV and LPV. An NPA uses a navigation system for course deviation but does not provide <b>glidepath</b> information. These approaches include VOR, NDB and LNAV. NPAs are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).|$|E

50|$|The HP-14 {{features}} a folding V-tail and 90-degree flaps for <b>glidepath</b> control. The fuselage and wings are of all-aluminum riveted construction.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{determined}} {{the cause of}} Indian Airlines Flight 440 crashing to be crew error in letting the aircraft descend below <b>glidepath.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{aviation}} a {{ground-controlled approach}} (GCA), {{is a type}} of service provided by air-traffic controllers whereby they guide aircraft to a safe landing, including in adverse weather conditions, based on primary radar images. Most commonly a GCA uses information from either a Precision Approach Radar (PAR, for precision approaches with vertical, <b>glidepath</b> guidance) or an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR, providing a non-precision Surveillance radar approach with no <b>glidepath</b> guidance). The term GCA may refer to any type of ground radar guided approach such as a PAR, PAR without glideslope or ASR. When both vertical and horizontal guidance from the PAR is given, the approach is termed a precision approach. If no PAR <b>glidepath</b> is given, even if PAR equipment is used for lateral guidance, it is considered a non-precision approach ...|$|E
50|$|This is one {{in which}} a {{controller}} provides highly accurate navigational guidance inazimuth and elevation to a pilot. Pilots are given headings to fly, to direct them to, and keep their aircraft alignedwith the extended centerline of the landing runway. They are told to anticipate <b>glidepath</b> interceptionapproximately 10-30 seconds before it occurs and when to start descent. The published decision height will be givenonly if the pilot requests it. If the aircraft is observed to deviate above or below the <b>glidepath,</b> the pilot is giventhe relative amount of deviation by use of terms “slightly” or “well” and is expected to adjust the aircraft rateof descent/ascent to return to the <b>glidepath.</b> Trend information is also issued with respect to the elevation ofthe aircraft and may be modified by the terms “rapidly” and “slowly” (e.g., “well above <b>glidepath,</b> comingdown rapidly”). Range from touchdown is given at least once each mile. If an aircraft is observed by thecontroller to proceed outside of specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation and continue to operateoutside these prescribed limits, the pilot will be directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a specifiedcourse unless the pilot has the runway environment (runway, approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigationalguidance in azimuth and elevation is provided the pilot until the aircraft reaches the published decision height. Advisorycourse and <b>glidepath</b> information is furnished by the controller until the aircraft passes over the landingthreshold, at which point the pilot is advised of any deviation from the runway centerline. Radar service isautomatically terminated upon completion of the approach.|$|E
5000|$|Descent : The descent {{during the}} final leg is {{typically}} flown at 1.3 times the stall speed of the aircraft, and usually with the flaps extended. Large [...] "airline" [...] (transport) type aircraft, are flown on a 3 degree slope or <b>glidepath.</b> Smaller light aircraft will typically be flown on a 4 to 6 degree <b>glidepath.</b> Typical power settings are 3/4 full power. The rate of descent typically ranges from approximately 300 ft/min (100 m/min) for light aircraft to 700 ft/min (200 m/min) for transport category.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theoretical}} underpinnings to <b>glidepath</b> design {{are based}} on combining modern portfolio theory, with the theory of [...] "Human Capital", {{the present value of}} expected future earnings.|$|E
50|$|The GW-5 was {{designed}} for the standard class and as such it features a constant-chord 15 m wing with a Wortmann FX 61-184 airfoil and flaps for <b>glidepath</b> control.|$|E
50|$|When the {{glideslope}} is unserviceable, the localizer element {{can often}} be conducted as a separate non-precision approach, abbreviated to 'LOC'. A standalone instrument approach installation without an associated <b>glidepath</b> carries the abbreviation 'LLZ'.|$|E
50|$|The BS-1 is {{constructed}} entirely from fiberglass and features an 18.0 m wing with flaps and dive brakes. For further <b>glidepath</b> control the BS-1 has a tail-mounted parachute. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel.|$|E
50|$|During the Berlin Blockade of 1948-1949, planes {{headed for}} Tempelhof in West Berlin tuned their radios to AFN-Berlin because the station's {{transmission}} tower {{was in the}} <b>glidepath</b> to the airfield and was not jammed by the Soviets.|$|E
5000|$|Control system: conventional, split elevator/horizontal {{stabiliser}} for {{longitudinal control}} and top surface Schempp-Hirth air brakes for <b>glidepath</b> control, ailerons with marked differential occupying the outer 50% of the wing’s trailing edge. Controls via pushrods with automatic coupling during rigging.|$|E
50|$|Each {{light unit}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} more light sources, red filters and lenses. Each light unit emits a high-intensity beam. The lower segment of the beam is red, and the upper part is white. The transition between the two colours must take place over an angle not greater than three minutes of arc. This characteristic makes the color change very conspicuous, a key feature of the PAPI signal. To form the PAPI guidance signal, the color transition boundaries of the four units are fixed at different angles. The lowest angle is used for the unit furthest from the runway, the highest for the unit nearest to the runway. The designated glideslope is midway between the second and third light unit settings. Depending on the position of the aircraft relative to the specified angle of approach, the lights will appear either red or white to the pilot. The pilot will have reached the normal <b>glidepath</b> (usually 3 degrees) when there is an equal number of red and white lights. If an aircraft is beneath the <b>glidepath,</b> red lights will outnumber white; if an aircraft is above the <b>glidepath,</b> more white lights are visible.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} steel tubing and aluminium, with fiberglass fairings. Its 13 m span wing employs a Somers-Maughmer SM701 airfoil and features balanced top and bottom DFS-style air brakes for <b>glidepath</b> control. A ballistic parachute was to be standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|The control {{surfaces}} include an all flying tail fitted with an anti-servo tab and full-span ailerons of very short chord {{that act as}} flaps when drooped for <b>glidepath</b> control. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel that is faired to reduce drag.|$|E
