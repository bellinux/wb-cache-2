5|$|Liu Bei then attacks <b>either</b> Wei or Wu, {{depending}} on if the fire attack at Chi Bi succeeds or not. <b>Either</b> Wei or Wu {{will be the}} final battle where you attack their capital; the battles are the same.|$|E
5|$|Mloukhiyeh is a stew {{made from}} Corchorus. The Corchorus is picked during harvest time, and is <b>either</b> frozen or dried. It is widely {{popular in the}} middle east, as it is {{commonly}} grown in dry climate areas. The stew is cooked with lemon juice and water, and served with cut lemons and rice. The meal can be served with <b>either</b> chicken or lamb however it can be served without <b>either</b> (unlike many other Palestinian meals).|$|E
5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has <b>either</b> {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in <b>either</b> discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in <b>either</b> countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} pressed {{vegetable}} oils are <b>either</b> not edible, or not {{used as an}} edible oil.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the third}} legend, Horodecki had cur it in 1913 (due to his {{inability}} to repay his creditors); all of the house's tenants would be <b>either</b> unhappy or would meet some sort of financial misfortune. There {{is a story that}} all the businesses who rented a portion of the building <b>either</b> went bankrupt, had their funds stolen or were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|All of the German gun turrets {{initially}} {{allowed for}} elevation to 13.5degrees, although {{after the battle}} of Jutland, they were modified to allow elevation to 16degrees. The centerline turrets on the warships could train 150degrees in <b>either</b> direction, though the wing turrets on the Helgoland and Kaiser classes were limited to an arc of 80degrees in <b>either</b> direction.|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{performed}} by George Harrison and produced <b>either</b> by himself or with Phil Spector.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating <b>either</b> STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require <b>either</b> catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E

5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), who could be <b>either</b> a native nobleman, who would {{probably}} be granted Roman citizenship for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship probably by serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a Roman, <b>either</b> of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose <b>either</b> behavior. The numbers choosing <b>either</b> producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E

5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than <b>either</b> word alone. Coordinate compounds join <b>either</b> two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean <b>either</b> an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Dengue can {{occasionally}} affect {{several other}} body systems, <b>either</b> in isolation or {{along with the}} classic dengue symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is attributable <b>either</b> to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly {{as a result of}} impairment of vital organs, for example, the liver.|$|E
5|$|Each {{circle is}} {{supervised}} by a Knights of Columbus council or assembly, {{and has an}} advisory board made up of <b>either</b> the Grand Knight, the Deputy Grand Knight and Chaplain, or the Faithful Navigator, the Faithful Captain, and Faithful Friar. Circles are <b>either</b> council based, parish based, or school based, depending on {{the location of the}} circle and the Knight counselors.|$|E
5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes {{were to be}} carried. Four {{of these}} would be mounted inside the hull below the {{waterline}}, two at <b>either</b> side of the bow; the others would be above the waterline at the stern, two at <b>either</b> side.|$|E

5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck on <b>either</b> side of the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned on <b>either</b> side of the centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema {{had to rely on}} its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for <b>either</b> the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it <b>either</b> before or during implant placement.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok's {{schools are}} <b>either</b> {{run by the}} state {{government}} or by private and religious organizations. Schools mainly use English and Nepali as their medium of instruction.

Notable schools include the Tashi Namgyal Academy, Paljor Namgyal Girls School, Taktse International School and Kendriya Vidyalaya.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4a was {{released}} on March 4, 2010, and adds two additional mandatory 3D formats for broadcast content, which was deferred with HDMI 1.4 {{in order to see}} the direction of the 3D broadcast market. HDMI 1.4a has defined mandatory 3D formats for broadcast, game, and movie content. HDMI 1.4a requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at <b>either</b> 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24, side-by-side horizontal at <b>either</b> 1080i50 or 1080i60, and top-and-bottom at <b>either</b> 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views <b>either</b> animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase <b>either</b> one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having <b>either</b> animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
5|$|In 21 {{years on}} the federal bench, Parker tried 13,490 cases; more than 8,500 {{defendants}} <b>either</b> pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial.

5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, {{they were able to}} find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as <b>either</b> 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was <b>either</b> 260105 or 261105.|$|E
5|$|In {{materials}} science, {{surface tension}} {{is used for}} <b>either</b> surface stress or surface free energy.|$|E
5|$|In other words, {{a country}} that imports more than it exports must <b>either</b> {{decrease}} its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must <b>either</b> increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries {{to allow them to}} buy German goods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} armies, cavalry units {{were known as}} vexillationes palatini and vex. comitatenses; {{infantry}} units as <b>either</b> legiones palatini, auxilia palatini, leg. comitatenses, and pseudocomitatenses. Auxilia were only graded as palatini, emphasising their elite status, while the legiones are graded <b>either</b> palatini or comitatenses.|$|E
