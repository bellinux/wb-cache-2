Typically terms for prior-art queries are extracted from the claim fields of query patents. However, due to the complex technical structure of patents, and presence of terms mismatch and vague terms, selecting relevant terms for queries is a difficult task. During evaluating the patents retrievability coverage of prior-art queries generated from query patents, a large bias toward {{a subset of the}} collection is experienced. A large number of patents either have a very low retrievability score or can not be discovered via any query. To increase the retrievability of patents, in this paper we expand prior-art queries generated from query patents using query expansion with pseudo relevance <b>feedback.</b> <b>Missing</b> terms from query patents are discovered from feedback patents, and better patents for relevance feedback are identified using a novel approach for checking their similarity with query patents. We specifically focus on how to automatically select better terms from query patents based on their proximity distribution with prior-art queries that are used as features for computing similarity. Our results show, that the coverage of prior-art queries can be increased significantly by incorporating relevant queries terms using query expansion. ...|$|E
40|$|Permafrost stores {{globally}} {{significant amounts}} of carbon (C) which may start to decompose and be released to the atmosphere in form of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) as global warming promotes extensive thaw. This permafrost carbon feedback to climate is currently {{considered to be the}} most important carbon-cycle <b>feedback</b> <b>missing</b> from climate models. Predicting the magnitude of the feedback requires a better understanding of how differences in environmental conditions post-thaw, particularly hydrological conditions, control the rate at which C is released to the atmosphere. In the sporadic and discontinuous permafrost regions of north-west Canada, we measured the rates and sources of C released from relatively undisturbed ecosystems, and compared these with forests experiencing thaw following wildfire (well-drained, oxic conditions) and collapsing peat plateau sites (water-logged, anoxic conditions). Using radiocarbon analyses, we detected substantial contributions of deep soil layers and/or previously-frozen sources in our well-drained sites. In contrast, no loss of previously- frozen C as CO 2 was detected on average from collapsed peat plateaus regardless of time since thaw and despite the much larger stores of available C that were exposed. Furthermore, greater rates of new peat formation resulted in these soils becoming stronger C sinks and this greater rate of uptake appeared to compensate for a large proportion of the increase in CH 4 emissions from the collapse wetlands. We conclude that in the ecosystems we studied, changes in soil moisture and oxygen availability may be even more important than previously predicted in determining the effect of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C balance and, thus, it is essential to monitor, and simulate accurately, regional changes in surface wetness...|$|E

The main aim of the research is to explore both the short and long term effects of a collection scheme of portable waste batteries on the environment. To this end, a system dynamics model has been built to examine how the physical processes and information flows interrelate in the structure of a dynamic system, and how this structure generates dynamic behaviour over time. A collection scheme in operation in Belgium was used as the case study. The model developed sheds light on the structure of the system and shows that important <b>feedback</b> is <b>missing</b> compared to other types of battery collection models.

40|$|Catchment-scale {{hydrological}} models frequently miss {{essential characteristics}} of what determines {{the functioning of}} catchments. The most important active agent in catchments is the ecosystem. It manipulates and partitions moisture {{in a way that}} supports the essential functions of survival and productivity: infiltration of water, retention of moisture, mobilization and retention of nutrients, and drainage. Ecosystems do this in the most efficient way, establishing a continuous, ever-evolving feedback loop with the landscape and climatic drivers. In brief, hydrological systems are alive and have a strong capacity to adjust themselves to prevailing and changing environmental conditions. Although most models take Newtonian theory at heart, as best they can, what they generally miss is Darwinian theory on how an ecosystem evolves and adjusts its environment to maintain crucial hydrological functions. In addition, catchments, such as many other natural systems, do not only evolve over time, but develop features of spatial organization, including surface or sub-surface drainage patterns, as a by-product of this evolution. Models that fail to account for patterns and the associated <b>feedbacks</b> <b>miss</b> a critical element of how systems at the interface of atmosphere, biosphere and pedosphere function. In contrast to what is widely believed, relatively simple, semi-distributed conceptual models have the potential to accommodate organizational features and their temporal evolution in an efficient way, a reason for that being that because their parameters (and their evolution over time) are effective at the modelling scale, and thus integrate natural heterogeneity within the system, they may be directly inferred from observations at the same scale, reducing the need for calibration and related problems. In particular, the emergence of new and more detailed observation systems from space will lead towards a more robust understanding of spatial organization and its evolution. This will further permit the development of relatively simple time-dynamic functional relationships that can meaningfully represent spatial patterns and their evolution over time, even in poorly gauged environments.

To explain optical properties of a given monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide, one should consider (i) the order of its spin-split conduction bands, (ii) whether intervalley scattering is prone to phonon bottleneck, (iii) and whether valley mixing by electron-hole exchange can take place. Using these principles, we present a consistent physical picture that elucidates a variety of features in the optical spectra of these materials. We explain the differences between optical transitions in monolayer MoSe$_ 2 $ and monolayer WSe$_ 2 $, finding that indirect excitons in the latter correspond to several low-energy optical transitions that so far were attributed to excitons bound to impurities. A possible mechanism that can explain the vanishing polarization in MoSe$_ 2 $ is discussed. Finally, we consider the effect of an out-of-plane electric field, showing that it can reduce the initial polarization of bright excitons due to a Rashba-type coupling with dark excitons.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{systematic}} exploration of reputation mechanism design in trading environments with opportunistic sellers of commonly known cost and ability parameters, imperfect monitoring of a seller’s actions, and two possible seller effort levels, {{one of which}} has no value to buyers. The objective of reputation mechanisms in such pure moral hazard settings is to induce sellers to exert high effort as often as possible. I study the impact of various mechanism parameters (such as the granularity of solicited feedback, {{the format of the}} public reputation profile, the policy regarding <b>missing</b> <b>feedback,</b> and the rules for admitting new sellers) on the resulting market efficiency. I find that maximum efficiency is bounded away from the hypothetical firstbest case where sellers can credibly precommit to full cooperation by a factor that is related to the probability that cooperating sellers may receive “unfair ” bad ratings. Furthermore, maximum efficiency is independent of the length of past history summarized in a seller’s public reputation profile. I apply my framework to a simplified model of eBay’s feedback mechanism and conclude that, in pure moral hazard settings, eBay’s simple mechanism is capable of inducing the maximum theoretical efficiency independently of the number of recent ratings that are being summarized in a seller’s profile. I derive optimal policies for dealing with <b>missing</b> <b>feedback</b> and easy online identity changes. Finally, I show that if the number of buyers is large, the results obtained in the monopoly case are also approximately valid in settings where multiple sellers of different reputations simultaneously offer auctions for identical goods.

Within single neurons, interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops generate circadian rhythms on the molecular level. We present {{a mathematical model}} that reflects the essential features of the mammalian circadian oscillator to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback loops. The oscillations that are obtained have a 24 -h period and are robust toward parameter variations even when the positive feedback {{is replaced by a}} constantly expressed activator. This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm generation. Moreover, it explains the rhythmic phenotype of Rev-erbα−/− mutant mice, where a positive <b>feedback</b> is <b>missing.</b> The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex dynamics. In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of circadian oscillations in Per 2 Brdm 1 /Cry 2 −/− double-mutant mice (Per 2 Brdm 1 single-mutant mice are arrhythmic). Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the Per 2 gene is compensated by the Cry 2 −/− mutation that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback strength. Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral phenotype: circadian oscillations should be rescued when arrhythmic Per 2 Brdm 1 mutant mice are crossed with Rev- erbα−/− mutant mice...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{challenges}} facing the South African education system, suburban schools are often assumed to be sites of excellence, and therefore seldom the objects of research. This notion, {{as well as the}} persistently poor literacy rates in South African primary schools and the need for more research on the teaching and learning of writing at the upper-primary level across school systems, motivates this case study. This research maintains a sociocultural view of literacy and learning. The linguistic ethnographic approach, carried out with classroom observations, field notes, video-recording and semi-structured interviews, necessitated particular attention to the specific practices of this 'niche' (Nystrand, Gamoran & Carbonaro, 1998) environment. Therefore, although I planned to analyse classroom discourses and students' writing to determine if and how students identify as writers, the teacher's profound disengagement with her pedagogy, her dominant procedural discourse and the closing down of opportunities for her students to take up positions as writers needed to be centred. This focus was particularly important, as in the broader context of her school and the South African education system, Miss King is perceived to be a 'good teacher;' this notion was substantiated by the <b>feedback</b> <b>Miss</b> King received from the Department of Basic Education representative who inspected the school during my field work. Critical Discourse Analysis (Gee, 2008; Janks, 1997; Rogers et al., 2005), Positioning Theory (Davies & Harré, 1990) and Ivanič's (2004) Discourses of Writing were used as conceptual resources in the analysis of the data gathered. These tools enabled an examination of how the participants in a Grade 6 classroom use and navigate discourses to position themselves and others. The teacher self positioned as the authoritative 'knower' through her use of monologic speaking turns and a restrictive Initiation-Response-Evaluation discoursal structure. Despite her assessment driven language and her insistence on students using the process approach when writing, her disengagement from her pedagogy, inability to talk about her learners as writers and unnecessarily prescriptive parameters for compositions, demanded an adaptation of Ivanič's Discourses of Writing framework; in order to capture the superficiality of her discourse, I have added a 'procedural discourse' category. Through this discourse, Miss King can be seen to position her students as nonwriters. In spite of the limiting opportunities to engage meaningfully with their teacher and their learning, the students' abilities to reposition themselves illustrate their continued agency in this space. That they control the classroom discourses during writing sessions, after the teacher delivers her introductions, demonstrates their power in this classroom, their ability to manage their teacher. Still, that some students are able to resist Miss King's positioning to maintain identities as writers occurs despite her pedagogy, not because of it; and those who struggle to reposition themselves are unfairly denied access to identities that should be open to them within the space of the classroom...|$|R

Inferences from the observational record, however, place {{climate sensitivity}} near {{the lower end of}} this range and indicate that models underestimate some of the changes in the hydrological cycle. These discrepancies raise the possibility that important <b>feedbacks</b> are <b>missing</b> from the models. A controversial hypothesis suggests that the dry and clear regions of the tropical atmosphere expand in a warming climate and thereby allow more infrared radiation to escape to space. This so-called iris effect could constitute a negative feedback that is not included in climate models. We find that inclusion of such an effect in a climate model moves the simulated responses of both temperature and the hydrological cycle to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations closer to observations. Alternative suggestions for shortcomings of models — such as aerosol cooling, volcanic eruptions or insufficient ocean heat uptake — may explain a slow observed transient warming relative to models, but not the observed enhancement of the hydrological cycle. We propose that, if precipitating convective clouds are more likely to cluster into larger clouds as temperatures rise, this process could constitute a plausible physical mechanism for an iris effect...|$|R

We opened synthetic positive feedback loops experimentally to obtain open-loop functions. These functions allowed us to identify a deterministic model of bistability by bypassing noise and the requirement to resolve individual processes in the loop. Combining the open-loop function with kinetic measurements and reintroducing the measured noise, we were able to predict the transition rates for the feedback systems without parameter tuning. Noise in gene expression was the key determinant of the transition rates inside the bistable range. Transitions between two cell fates were also observed outside of the bistable range, evidenced by bimodality and hysteresis. In this case, a slow transient process was the rate-limiting step in the transitions. Thus, feedback opening is an effective approach to identify the determinants of cell fate transitions and to predict their rates...|$|R

40|$|Alternative cell fates {{represent}} {{a form of}} non-genetic diversity, which can promote adaptation and functional specialization. It is difficult to predict {{the rate of the}} transition between two cell fates due to the strong effect of noise on <b>feedback</b> loops and <b>missing</b> parameters. We opened synthetic positive feedback loops experimentally to obtain open-loop functions. These functions allowed us to identify a deterministic model of bistability by bypassing noise and the requirement to resolve individual processes in the loop. Combining the open-loop function with kinetic measurements and re-introducing the measured noise, we were able to predict the transition rates for the feedback systems without parameter tuning. Noise in gene expression was the key determinant of the transition rates inside the bistable range. Transitions between two cell fates were also observed outside of the bistable range, evidenced by bimodality and hysteresis. In this case, a slow transient process was the rate limiting step in the transitions. Thus, feedback opening is an effective approach to identify the determinants of cell fate transitions and to predict their rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High {{throughput}} {{gene expression}} profiling (GEP) {{is becoming a}} routine technique in life science laboratories. With experimental designs that repeatedly span thousands of genes and hundreds of samples, relying on a dedicated database infrastructure {{is no longer an}} option. GEP technology is a fast moving target, with new approaches constantly broadening the field diversity. This technology heterogeneity, compounded by the informatics complexity of GEP databases, means that software developments have so far focused on mainstream techniques, leaving less typical yet established techniques such as Nylon microarrays at best partially supported. Results MAF (MicroArray Facility) is the laboratory database system we have developed for managing the design, production and hybridization of spotted microarrays. Although it can support the widely used glass microarrays and oligo-chips, MAF was designed with the specific idiosyncrasies of Nylon based microarrays in mind. Notably single channel radioactive probes, microarray stripping and reuse, vector control hybridizations and spike-in controls are all natively supported by the software suite. MicroArray Facility is MIAME supportive and dynamically provides <b>feedback</b> on <b>missing</b> annotations to help users estimate effective MIAME compliance. Genomic data such as clone identifiers and gene symbols are also directly annotated by MAF software using standard public resources. The MAGE-ML data format is implemented for full data export. Journalized database operations (audit tracking), data anonymization, material traceability and user/project level confidentiality policies are also managed by MAF. Conclusion MicroArray Facility is a complete data management system for microarray producers and end-users. Particular care has been devoted to adequately model Nylon based microarrays. The MAF system, developed and implemented in both private and academic environments, has proved a robust solution for shared facilities and industry service providers alike. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article compares interactively coupled atmosphere-ocean hindcast {{simulations}} with stand-alone runs of {{the atmosphere}} and ocean models using the recently developed regional ocean-atmosphere model NEMO-Nordic for the North Sea and Baltic Sea. In the interactively coupled run, the ocean and the atmosphere components were allowed to exchange mass, momentum and heat every 3 h. Our results show that interactive coupling significantly improves simulated winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Baltic Sea. The ocean and atmosphere stand-alone runs, respectively, resulted in too low sea surface and air temperatures over the Baltic Sea. These two runs suffer from too cold prescribed ERA 40 SSTs, which lower air temperatures and weaken winds in the atmosphere only run. In the ocean-only run, the weaker winds additionally lower the vertical mixing thereby lowering the upward transport of warmer subpycnocline waters. By contrast, in the interactively coupled run, the ocean-atmosphere heat exchange evolved freely and demonstrated good skills in reproducing observed surface temperatures. Despite the strong impact on oceanic and atmospheric variables in the coupling area, no far reaching influence on atmospheric variables over land can be identified. In perturbation experiments, the different dynamics of the two coupling techniques is investigated in more detail by implementing strong positive winter temperature anomalies in the ocean model. Here, interactive coupling results in a substantially higher preservation of heat anomalies because the atmosphere also warmed which damped the ocean to atmosphere heat transfer. In the passively coupled set-up, this atmospheric <b>feedback</b> is <b>missing,</b> which resulted in an unrealistically high oceanic heat loss. The main added value of interactive air-sea coupling is twofold: (1) the elimination of any boundary condition at the air-sea interface and (2) the more realistic dynamical response to perturbations in the ocean-atmosphere heat balance, which will be essential in climate warming scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to observe the EU's {{institutional}} system {{from the viewpoint of}} its effectivity and impact on the economic growth and various trasnmission mechanisms. The EU is a group consisting of 27 countries from different cultural backgrounds, with different national mentalitities, economic, social and politic systems. The economical and political integration is not taking place in a spontaneous way, as a process of continuous cognition, analysis and learning from mistakes, but according to a plan comming from upper political levels and with emphasis on the aims more than on the means. In the EU there are at least 2 levels of legislature, executive and jurisdiction, each on the national and supranational level. The nature of these 2 levels is rather parallel than vertical. An important link and therefore effective <b>feedback</b> is <b>missing</b> between the supranational level and the national level represented through the vote of the population and the performance of the economic environment. Constructivistic efforts are encumbering the economy of the EU with balast, that can be understood as a pool of from the system arising ineffectivities. The result of this balast is an inhibition of the economic growth despite declarations to accelerate it. This thesis will observe these ineffectivities through a more detailed analysis of macroeconomic fields as are monetary policy, labour markets and tax systems. The emphasis will be put on concrete impacts of supranational policies on individual countries, areas inside the EU and the EU as a whole. The USA will serve as a benchmark, because the EU has the ambition to get ahead of them as the world largest economy and that by the year 2010. The nature of these ineffectivities is of a rather hidden nature and therefore I will preffer the studying of literature in fields of interest as a mean of identifying the ineffectivities rather than atual quantifications...|$|R
40|$|Purposeful {{collective}} action {{is important for}} sustainably managing many kinds of natural resource issues in social-ecological systems. However, cultivating purposeful {{collective action}} is challenging in ambiguous and contested situations involving multiple issues, actors, levels, and drivers, and weak or <b>missing</b> <b>feedback.</b> A particular example {{is the problem of}} managing waterway health in large and diverse landscapes. This paper analyses the emergence of purposeful collective action for managing waterway health, focusing on a case study of a large and diverse region in Australia. It applies a heuristic developed to guide inquiry into ‘enabling capacities’ underpinning purposeful collective action, to analyse three local cases embedded within a broader regional landscape. A diverse range of enabling capacities at both local and regional levels, and cross-level interplay between these levels, are shown to be important. Findings imply that efforts to generate purposeful collective action require building enabling capacities across multiple levels of organisation, from which contextually-appropriate and adaptive action can emerge. Moreover, findings indicate the need for a practice-focused ‘knowledge-action perspective’ that recognises the importance of intersubjectivity and agency. The paper demonstrates a promising approach for investigating purposeful collective action in ambiguous and contested water and environmental governance situations...|$|R
