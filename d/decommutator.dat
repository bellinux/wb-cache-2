This long needed standardization {{was designed to}} provide a common thread through which test programs could move from one test range to another without significant re-work in the setup environment. TMATS provides the definition of telemetry attributes and specifies the media and data format necessary to permit the ready transfer of the information required to setup telemetry receiving/processing functions at a test range. These attributes are defined as those parameters required by the receiving/processing system to acquire, process and display telemetry data received from a test item or source. As the telemetry vendor community develops more and more board level products designed to be integrated into various platforms such as Personal Computer (PC), VME, and VXI, the necessity of providing a setup environment, which is independent of a specific vendor product, becomes essential.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe {{testing of}} {{instrumented}} missile systems with extended range capabilities present many challenges to existing T&E and training ranges. Providing over-the-horizon (OTH) telemetry {{data collection and}} displaying portions of this data in real time for range safety purposes {{are just a few}} of many factors required for successful instrumented range support. Techniques typically used for OTH telemetry data collection are to use fixed or portable antennas installed at strategic down-range locations, instrumented relay pods installed on chase aircraft, and instrumented high flying relay aircraft. Multiple data sources from these various locations typically arrive at a central site within a telemetry ground station and must be merged together to determine the best data source for real time and post processing purposes. Before multiple telemetered sources can be merged, the time skews caused by the relay of down-range land and airborne based sources must be taken into account. The time skews are fixed for land based sources, but vary with airborne sources. Various techniques have been used to remove the time skews associated with multiple telemetered sources. These techniques, which involve both hardware and software applications, have been effective, but are expensive and application and range dependent. This paper describes the use of a personal computer (PC) based workstation, configured with independent Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) decommutators/bit synchronizers, Inner-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) timing, and data merging resident software to perform the data merging task. Current technology now permits multiple PCM <b>decommutators,</b> each built as a separate virtual memory expansion (VME) card, to be installed within a PC based workstation. Each land based or airborne source is connected to a dedicated VME based PCM decommutator/bit synchronizer within the workstation. After the exercise has been completed, data merging software resident within the workstation is run which reads the digitized data from each of the disk files and aligns the data on a bit by bit basis to determine the optimum merged result. Both time based and event based alignment is performed when merging the multiple sources.

The CSS’s bridging feature unexpectedly {{opened the door to}} a ubiqituous software <b>decommutator</b> (decom) that has catalyzed a complete “make-over” of the entire TDC architecture. Hardware and software interaction in a decom is different with the CSS. While performing its correlation tasks the CSS is able to provide raw data over TCP/IP directly to the end application. The CSS places the data in computer friendly frame aligned form and the decommutation may be performed in software. The converse is similarly simple, a data file maybe transferred to the CSS for commutation into PCM. This white paper describes the morphing of software decommutation into a commodity, integrated into each end device, be it graphics display, Disk or Chart recorder. The result is an interesting consolidation that spawns a new functionally integrated Telemetry Data Center (iTDC). This integrated Display Decom (iDD) concept has been demonstrated on Apple G 5 RISC computers...|$|E
