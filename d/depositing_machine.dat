40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} adhesion of bacterial on metal surfaces {{and the effect}} of metal’s surface roughness to the bacterial adhesion. The objectives of this research are, to study the adhesion of bacterial on metal surfaces (Stainless Steel (N 690), Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC) and Titanium) used in medical application {{and the effect of}} surface roughness on the wettability thus adhesion. Three types of bacteria were used for this research which was Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus attached on the individual metal which has eight different ranges of surface roughness, achieved by fabricating using electro <b>depositing</b> <b>machine</b> (E) and electropolishing (P) techniques. The adhesion test was done for 4 hours for each bacterium with different types of metal and surface roughness. After the adhesion test, the attached bacteria on metal surfaces were dyed using fluorescence dye, SYTO 9 and examined under the fluorescence microscope. The number of attached cells was counted and results were displayed as number attached per square area. Besides that, the absorbance and the colony forming unit (CFU) were also measured and the surface which gives highest optical density (OD) was identified. Finally, metal with highest attachment of bacterial, were analyzed under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to observe the bacterial cells attachments. Results obtained indicated that E. coli was a Gram negative bacterium while both B. subtilis and S. aureus were Gram positive bacteria. After the adhesion test, the OD reading for E. coli shows the highest reduction which is in the range of 6 % to 45. 7 % compared to others bacterial solution. CFU plating for E. coli at dilution factor 102 also showed the lowest among others after the adhesion test. Besides that, the adhesion of bacterial on Stainless Steel (N 690) recorded that, the highest attachment of all bacterial were on smooth surface (Ra = 0. 163 μm) and rough surface (Ra = 2. 910) with the total adhesion were 0. 1833 / μm 2 and 0. 1755 / μm 2 respectively. Meanwhile, adhesion on Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC) and Titanium shows similar trend where both B. subtilis and S. aureus provide the highest adhesion at the roughness 0. 110 μm and 0. 104 (smooth surface), respectively. On the other hand, the adhesion of bacterial on different metal with the same roughness (Ra = ~ 0. 15 μm) showed that B. subtilis like to adhere to Titanium surface with the adhesion value 0. 9601 /μm 2, while S. aureus and E. coli were adhered at Stainless Steel (N 690) and Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC), respectively with the total adhesion 0. 0679 /μm 2 and 0. 0704 /μm 2 each...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Increasingly {{companies}} {{are realizing that}} long term survival is tied to delivering valued products or services that satisfy customersâ€™ needs. As {{the environment in which}} they operate becomes more competitive, {{companies are}} increasingly paying attention to the role of customer satisfaction in customer choices of products and its role in attaining and retaining customers. Technology development particularly in the area of Telecommunications and Information Technology are revolutionizing the way of doing business for banking industry. Automated Teller Machines (ATMâ€™s) which introduced to Malaysia in the early of 1980 â€™s {{is the beginning of the}} evolution of electronic banking in Malaysia. Banks can enhance the convenience of banking for their customers and maximizing their business efficiencies through the self-service channel. Today, there are various types of self-service terminals being used by the local banks such as cash <b>deposit</b> <b>machine</b> and cheque <b>deposit</b> <b>machine.</b> It shows that banks is further migrating consumer transactions from the teller line to the self-service channel. Nevertheless, researches show that many consumers prefer to receive a deposit slip from a teller than a machine due to lack of confidence in the system, fear of error, limited availability of funds deposited at the ATM and others. As such, this paper mainly describes the customer satisfaction on the self-service terminal within the vicinity of Johor Bahru. Questionnaires method is used in this research with the sample size of 200 respondent. The analysis method includes frequency, percentage, mean and correlation. In general, the customer satisfaction on the self-service terminal is average good and the deficiencies are on the service empathy and reliability aspects. ...|$|R

Services provided by a branch include cash withdrawals and deposits from a demand account with a bank teller, financial advice through a specialist, safe deposit box rentals, bureau de change, insurance sales (where it is allowed by law), etc. In the early 21st century, features such as automated teller machines (ATM), telephone and online banking, allow customers to bank from remote locations and after business hours. This has caused financial institutions to reduce their branch business hours and to merge smaller branches into larger ones. Conversely, they converted some into mini-branches with only ATMs for cash withdrawal and depositing; computer terminals for online banking and cheque <b>depositing</b> <b>machines.</b> Some mini-branches may have one or no human staff with only telephone support.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{invention}} of ATM machine marked a revolutionary {{change in the}} Banking sector. It made the money withdrawal an easier and flexible task. This changed the acronym of ATM from Automated Teller Machine to Any Time Money. This popularity was gained only with a single feature WITHDRAW. It is difficult to deposit the money to a Bank account through the traditional method {{of going to the}} bank, writing the slip, standing in the queue and depositing the money. So, what if DEPOSIT is also made possible in an ATM? As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, cash in the system (currency with people) stands at Rs. 11, 64, 450 crore as on September 6, 2013. Approximately 10 per cent of the economy is cash with people. So, if a part of that cash comes back into the system, that itself puts more resources with the banks and the country would benefit. Today, bank branches close at 4 or 5 p. m. whereas most of India’s retail trade happens in the evening. So, banks need {{to have the ability to}} set up cash <b>deposit</b> <b>machines.</b> We propose a system that can not only accept bank notes, but also detect the presence of counterfeit notes, separate notes based on genuineness and denomination, and give the total amount deposited; and hence provide a highly useful extension to existing ATMs and a secure way of cash deposits...|$|R

The figure reveals that PCBs are creating shared value (long term business value and social & environmental value simultaneously) through their core banking operations (innovative products and services) that are meeting the banking needs of {{the bottom of the}} pyramid. The selected PCBs are to some extent focusing on the following innovative products to meet the banking needs of the bottom of the pyramid are categorized as SME (including firms of women entrepreneurs), agriculture (including rural micro credit), mobile financial services, environment friendly banking, and school banking. The PCBs are also focusing on time, cost, convenience and easiness of customers for those innovative products (Islam and Hossain, 2018 b). To do so, banks have also been broadly innovating their services such as ATMs, Cash <b>Deposit</b> <b>Machines</b> (CDMs), fast track, agent banking, online banking, SMS, call centers, corporate cash management, locker, remittance, advisory, brokerage, E-Commerce, contract farming, cluster based financing etc. The core banking operations of PCBs are creating concurrent value for both the business and society. The core banking operations are creating business value of PCBs in terms of improved profitability, productivity, market share and corporate reputation. Simultaneously, the core banking operations are also creating social value in terms of (i) enhanced job creation in the banks and self employment opportunities in rural areas, (Bendell, 2004) access to banking for the unbanked, (Bissoon, 2018) service and comfort for customers, (Bowen, 1953) regional development, (Broomhill, 2007) regulatory compliance, (Burke & Logsdon, 1996) government income, (Campbell, 2007) employee and customer learning, and (Carroll, 1979) reduced environment footprint among other.|$|R
