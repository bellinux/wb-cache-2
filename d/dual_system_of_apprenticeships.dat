40|$|The {{increasing}} {{international interest}} in the Austrian <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> has triggered a trend to transfer this <b>system,</b> or parts <b>of</b> it, to foreign countries including developing and transition countries. This paper analyzes the trend from a developmental perspective. After a historic outline of vocational education in international development and the discussion of current global trends in vocational education, the paper elaborates on the transfer <b>of</b> the <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> from a theoretical {{as well as an}} empirical perspective. It then goes on to describe the Austrian <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship.</b> In the empirical part, the paper first examines the status quo of the transfer trend as well as key players, funding possibilities, approaches, lessons of experience and challenges. Findings are subsequently analyzed from a developmental perspective. Finally, recommendations are made of how to strengthen the developmental impact. The paper concludes that while current transfer activities respond well to several criteria set out by the Austrian Development Cooperation, a number of open questions remain as to sustainability, systemic effect and economic bias, among others...|$|R

About 60 % of each cohort graduates in an apprenticeship in this system.

30|$|We {{examine the}} {{occupational}} and wage mobility of employees with a vocational training degree {{obtained in the}} German <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> training. The conceptual framework {{is based on the}} human capital theory and the search theory under the assumption of variation in occupational contents over time. The regression analysis shows that occupational changes are positively correlated with individual wages. It provides evidence that the degree of correlation depends on the similarity between the content of occupation in which the individual was trained and the kind of occupation in which the individual was employed {{at the time of the}} survey. Further, it shows that the voluntariness of occupational change also contributes to the degree of correlation. We measure the similarity of occupational contents with the task-based approach.|$|R
30|$|I use two {{indicators}} of occupational allocation as dependent variables: {{access to the}} service class and risk of unemployment. Both indicators {{have to be taken}} into account in order to fully capture changes in the relationship between graduates’ field of study and labour market positions. During higher education expansion and structural shifts in the labour market graduates from humanities, arts and social sciences might not only be disadvantaged in attaining beneficial career positions but may have problems to find employment at all. Due the strong prevalence of occupationally segmented labour markets and the <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship,</b> graduates from fields providing rather general skills may have difficulties to compete with vocationally-qualified school-leavers around intermediate and lower occupational positions and may therefore become rather unemployed.|$|R

In contrast to the results for West Germany, occupational changes in East Germany after reunification are associated with wage penalties. This negative wage effect is persistent and can be observed even 10 years after the occupational change. The general results suggest that human capital which was accumulated during apprenticeship training, is transferable across different occupations.

40|$|This {{strategy}} paper by the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) shows {{ways in which}} Germany once more can attain full employment in the coming decade. Much of what the previous government's "Agenda 2010 " has put into motion has clearly steered labor market development in the right direction. The reforms {{are one of the}} main reasons why Germany has been more resistant to the recent financial and economic crisis than other countries. While these achievements should not be called into question, further action is necessary. The IZA concept includes the following elements: (1) Education reform: Early childhood education must be improved. Social background should no longer determine future career prospects. More independence and competition between schools and universities would improve the quality of education. Selection of students into different secondary school tracks should occur at a higher age. The <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> training could be shortened. College tuition fees could be replaced by a graduate tax. (2) Welfare state reform: A consistent implementation of the principle of reciprocity would create additional employment incentives and make working for a living worthwhile again even for the low-skilled. Workfare is socially just and promotes independence rather than producing dependency. Child benefits should be granted primarily as vouchers. (3) Job placement reform: The problem groups of the labor market need one-stop support tailored to their individual needs as soon as they become unemployed. IZA proposes the creation of job centers that act independently from local and federal authorities in order to avoid the organizational maze of unclear responsibilities. (4) Immigration policy reform: Germany needs high-skilled immigrants to cope with demographic change and skilled labor shortages. A selection system for permanent immigrants and a market-based solution for temporary immigrants would substantially increase the economic benefits of immigration and create additional momentum for the realization of full employment. labor market policy, Agenda 2010, Hartz reforms, workfare, job center, education, demography, migration policy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> {{vocational}} {{education and training}} that build on the tradition <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship,</b> have many attractive qualities, seen from a political perspective. VET systems that comprise {{a significant amount of}} work-based training, provide a valuable alternative for young people who chose not to pursue an academic career. Countries with strong apprenticeship systems tend to have less youth unemployment and a smoother transition to the labour market than others. Furthermore, from a learning perspective, the outcomes of work-based training and informal learning are enhanced when they are combined with formal education in a <b>dual</b> <b>system.</b> In all the Nordic Countries full time work based apprenticeship has given way to more school-based forms of VET – though to very different extent: Sweden has integrated VET in a comprehensive Gymnasium while Denmark has maintained the apprenticeship model. The evolution of VET in the Nordic Countries shows that the integration of work-based training in an educational programme involves many challenges that question the future role and organisation of work-based training in VET. These challenges are examined in this chapter based mainly on analyses <b>of</b> the Danish <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> VET and comparisons with the other Nordic Countries.
