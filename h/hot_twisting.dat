40|$|We solve a <b>hot</b> <b>twisted</b> Eguchi-Kawai {{model with}} only timelike {{plaquettes}} in the deconfined phase, by computing the quadratic quantum fluctuations around the classical vacuum. The {{solution of the}} model has some novel features: the eigenvalues of the time-like link variable are separated in L bunches, if L {{is the number of}} links of the original lattice in the time direction, and each bunch obeys a Wigner semicircular distribution of eigenvalues. This solution becomes unstable at a critical value of the coupling constant, where it is argued that a condensation of classical solutions takes place. This can be inferred by comparison with the heat-kernel model in the hamiltonian limit, and the related Douglas-Kazakov phase transition in QCD 2. As a byproduct of our solution, we can reproduce the dependence of the coupling constant from the parameter describing the asymmetry of the lattice, in agreement with previous results by Karsch. ...|$|R
40|$|Orientation imaging {{microscopy}} (OIM) {{was performed}} on <b>hot</b> <b>twisted</b> polycrystalline 304 stainless steel specimens in order to study the characteristics of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in low stacking fault energy FCC metals. Microtexture analyses were carried out and the misorientation statistics of the recrystallized areas were derived. The results revealed that multiple twinning controls the formation of new orientations. DRX macrotextures were also measured in torsion and compression. These textures are highly sensitive to the deformation (Zener-Hollomon) parameter Z. High Z values lead to overall textures controlled by nucleation, whereas, at low Z values, selective growth is more predominant. A deformation and recrystallization model based on the OIM measurements and the steady state properties is proposed. The observed strong brass-type deformation textures were simulated by introducing self hardening coefficients. The transition from single to multiple-peak flow during DRX was investigated, together with {{the evolution of the}} grain size distribution. In particular, the effect of twinning on the evolution of the latter was simulated. Finally, it is shown that the model simulates texture development during DRX very well...|$|R

The most important feature we outline is the high degree of collimation, naturally following from the basic assumptions underlying the crystalline structure. The presence of non-zero dissipative effects allows the plasma ejection throughout the axial jet seed and the predicted values of the accretion rate are in agreement with observations.

40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of heat treatment modes of white cast irons for structure {{changes in their}} eutectic constituent, namely in disturbing the monolithic structure of ledeburite colonies cementite structure and eutectic net continuity. Also the mentioned heat treatment modes are targeted to the eutectic net shift for the most suitable position {{from the point of}} plastic deforming. Methodology. The hypoeutectic white cast irons with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and <b>hot</b> <b>twist</b> tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to cast irons mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the white cast irons low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of white hypoeutectic cast irons have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition white cast irons hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium white cast irons. It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in ledeburite colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value. The implementation of pre-heat treatment with phase recrystallization resulted in hypoeutectic white cast irons plasticity increasing. The obtained level of cast iron plasticity corresponds to the one of carbide class steels, which ensures the successful deformation by forging and rolling...|$|R
40|$|Recent Solar Dynamic Observatory {{observations}} {{reveal that}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs) {{consist of a}} multi-temperature structure: a hot flux rope and a cool leading front (LF). The flux rope first appears as a <b>twisted</b> <b>hot</b> channel in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 94 A ̊ and 131 A ̊ passbands. The <b>twisted</b> <b>hot</b> channel initially lies along the polarity inversion line and then rises and develops into the semi-circular flux rope-like structure during the impulsive acceleration phase of CMEs. In the meantime, the rising hot channel compresses the surrounding magnetic field and plasma, which successively stack into the CME LF. In this paper, we study in detail two well-observed CMEs occurred on 2011 March 7 and 2011 March 8, respectively. Each of them is associated with an M-class flare. Through a kinematic analysis we find that: (1) the hot channel rises earlier than the first appearance of the CME LF and {{the onset of the}} associated flare; (2) the speed of the hot channel is always faster than that of the LF, at least in the field of view of AIA. Thus, the hot channel acts as a continuous driver of the CME formation and eruption in the early acceleration phase. Subsequently, the two CMEs in white-light images can be well reproduced by the graduated cylindrical shell flux rope model. These results suggest that the pre-existing flux rope {{plays a key role in}} CME initiation and formation...|$|R

It was {{noted that the}} share of textile imports declined {{during the same period}} from about 41.3 percent of the total imports from China in 2002 to about 10 percent in 2008. The share of foot wear imports were also reported to have dropped from about 10 percent in 2002 to below 2 percent in 2008. It was mentioned that this was due to reduced domestic demand for Chinese textile and shoe products due to quality related problems. On the other hand, machinery and mechanical appliances imports were reported to have increased from about 18.7 percent in 2002 to about 55.2 percent in 2008. Plastic and rubber imports from China mainly pneumatic tires, rubber constituted 38 percent. Woven fabrics of synthetic yarn non-textured polyesters etc were among imports of larger volumes.

40|$|Using {{observations}} of the corona taken during the total solar eclipses of 2006 March 29 and 2008 August 1 in broadband white light and in narrow bandpass filters centered at Fe x 637. 4 nm, Fe xi 789. 2 nm, Fe xiii 1074. 7 nm, and Fe xiv 530. 3 nm, we show that prominences observed off the solar limb are enshrouded in <b>hot</b> plasmas within <b>twisted</b> magnetic structures. These shrouds, which are {{commonly referred to as}} cavities in the literature, are clearly distinct from the overlying arch-like structures that form the base of streamers. The existence of these hot shrouds had been predicted by model studies dating back to the early 1970 s, with more recent studies implying their association with twisted magnetic flux ropes. The eclipse observations presented here, which cover a temperature range of 0. 9 to 2 × 106 K, are the first to resolve the long-standing ambiguity associated with the temperature and magnetic structure of prominence cavities...|$|R
40|$|Total solar eclipses {{continue}} to provide unique opportunities for observing the corona, due primarily to the exceptional diagnostic capabilities offered by emission from forbidden lines. Such observations span the heliocentric distance range of 1 - 3 solar radii, providing information that is currently inaccessible to any space-borne or ground-based observatory. Taking advantage of such an opportunity, the most ambitious multi-wavelength observations to date were made simultaneously in broadband white light, H alpha 656. 3 nm, Fe IX 435. 9 nm, Fe X 637. 4 nm, Fe XI 789. 2 nm, Fe XIII 1074. 7 nm, Fe XIV 530. 3 nm and Ni XV 670. 2 nm, during the total solar eclipse of 11 July 2010 from Tatakoto, an atoll in French Polynesia. A number of curious coronal structures, namely ripples, streaks and a structure {{in the shape of}} a hook, were detected in the images. The ripples were most prominent in emission from spectral lines associated with temperatures around 106 K. The most prominent streak was associated with a conical-shaped void in the emission from the coolest line of Fe IX and from the hottest line of Ni XV. A prominence, which erupted prior to totality, produced the hook in the cooler lines of Fe X and Fe XI, spanning 0. 5 Rs in extent, centered at 1. 3 Rs, with a complex trail of <b>hot</b> and cool <b>twisted</b> structures connecting it to the solar surface.

40|$|We {{report on}} multi-wavelength {{observations}} of the corona taken simultaneously in broadband white light, and in seven spectral lines, H-alpha 656. 3 nm, Fe IX 435. 9 nm, Fe X 637. 4 nm, Fe XI 789. 2 nm, Fe XIII 1074. 7 nm, Fe XIV 530. 3 nm and Ni XV 670. 2 nm. The observations were made during the total solar eclipse of 11 July 2010 from the atoll of Tatakoto in French Polynesia. Simultaneous imaging with narrow bandpass filters {{in each of these}} spectral lines and in their corresponding underlying continua maximized the observing time during less than ideal observing conditions and yielded outstanding quality data. The application of two complementary image processing techniques revealed the finest details of coronal structures at 1 " resolution in white light, and 6. 5 " in each of the spectral lines. This comprehensive wavelength coverage confirmed earlier eclipse findings that the solar corona has a clear two-temperature structure: The open field lines, expanding outwards from the solar surface, are characterized by electron temperatures near 1 X 10 (exp 6) K, while the hottest plasma around 2 X 10 (exp 6) K resides in loop-like structures forming the bulges of streamers. The first images of the corona in the forbidden lines of Fe IX and Ni XV, showed that there was very little coronal plasma at temperatures below 5 X 10 (exp 5) K and above 2. 5 X 10 (exp 6) K. The data also enabled temperature differentiations as low as 0 : 2 X 10 (exp 6) K in different density structures. These observations showed how the passage of CMEs through the corona, prior to totality, produced large scale ripples and very sharp streaks, which could be identified with distinct temperatures for the first time. The ripples were most prominent in emission from spectral lines associated with temperatures around 10 (exp 6) K. The most prominent streak was associated with a conical-shaped void in the emission from the coolest line of Fe IX and from the hottest line of Ni XV. A prominence, which erupted prior to totality, appeared {{in the shape of a}} hook in the cooler lines of Fe X and Fe XI, spanning 0. 5 R(solar) in extent starting at a heliocentric distance of 1. 3 R(solar), with a complex trail of <b>hot</b> and cool <b>twisted</b> structures connecting it to the solar surface. Simultaneous Fe X 17. 4 nm observations from space by Proba 2 /SWAP provided an ideal opportunity for comparing emission from a coronal forbidden line, namely Fe X 637. 4 nm, with a space-based EUV allowed line. Comparison of the Fe X 17. 4 nm and 637. 4 nm emission provided the first textbook example of the role of radiative excitation in extending the detectability of coronal emission to much larger heliocentric distances than its collisionally excited component. These eclipse observations demonstrate the unique capabilities of coronal forbidden lines for exploring the evolution of the coronal magnetic field in the heliocentric distance range of 1 - 3 R(solar), which is currently inaccessible to any space-borne or ground-based observatory...|$|R
