5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, {{which appears to}} be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, has been noted to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna.

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in {{the wild}} and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E

5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins requires {{the use of}} known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the crash had long-reaching repercussions in the rail industry. In 2015, at the 15th anniversary of the accident, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a new system for handling maintenance introduced by Network Rail was confusing, {{and there was the}} potential <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> accident to re-occur. The union's general secretary said that Network Rail needed to act on their concerns, otherwise there would be industrial action.|$|E
5|$|The {{travel times}} {{are not the}} same, which should be {{indicated}} by an interference shift. However, if Fresnel's dragging coefficient {{is applied to the}} water in the aether frame, the travel time difference (to first order in v/c) vanishes. Using different setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient.

5|$|Vamei {{formed and}} reached {{tropical}} storm strength at 1.5ºN, only 156km (97mi) from the equator. This broke {{the previous record}} of Typhoon Sarah in the 1956 Pacific typhoon season, which reached tropical storm strength at 2.2ºN. Due {{to a lack of}} Coriolis effect near the equator, the formation of Vamei was previously considered impossible. However, a study by the Naval Postgraduate School indicated that the probability <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> equatorial development was at least once every four centuries.|$|E

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
