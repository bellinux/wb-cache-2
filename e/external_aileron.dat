40|$|The {{increased}} use of split flaps for the dual purpose of reducing the landing speed and shortening the landing glide of airplanes has established as acute the problem of obtaining satisfactory lateral control {{to be used in}} conjunction with the flaps with out the sacrifice of any of the effectiveness of the flaps. A large amount of work is being done on this problem by various organizations and individuals. Several of the devices developed seem usable, some of them unquestionably so. The present paper attempts to summarize the most promising results obtained to date. Topics covered include ordinary <b>ailerons,</b> <b>external</b> <b>ailerons,</b> floating ailerons, upper-surface ailerons, and spoilers. Although the <b>external</b> <b>ailerons</b> above the trailing edge of the wing and the spoilers {{at the rear of the}} wing appear quite promising, it would seem that probably the most satisfactory immediate solution of the problem, including the obtaining of light and smoothly graduated control forces, would in most cases be obtained by the use of the arrangement in which the flap is retracted ahead of ordinary narrow-chord ailerons and is deflected to the rear as well as downward when in use...|$|R
5000|$|The B-10 is {{configured}} as a tail-less flying wing. The aircraft's fuselage {{structure is}} made from aluminum tubing while the wing has a birch plywood D-cell leading edge and foam ribs, covered with Dacron sailcloth or doped aircraft fabric. Its 36 ft span wing employs a NACA 23015 airfoil, has an area of 136 sq ft, an aspect ratio of 8:1 and mounts <b>external</b> <b>ailerons</b> as well as wing tip rudders. The 8.5 ft outboard wing panels have 6 degrees of dihedral and the wing overall has 12 degrees of sweep. The controls are conventional three axis, with a top-mounted centre stick. Small engines in the [...] range can be used and the Zenoah G-25 of [...] has been fitted.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of flight tests made on five different lateral control devices that appeared adaptable to wings fitted with full span flaps: controllable auxiliary airfoils (airfoils mounted above and forward of {{the leading edge of the}} wings), <b>external</b> <b>ailerons</b> (airfoils mounted above the wing and slightly forward of its maximum ordinate), upper-surface ailerons (similar to split trailing-edge flaps except that they constitute the upper surface of the wing), ailerons that retract into the wing when in neutral, and narrow-chord conventional ailerons in combination with a special type of split flap that retracts into the under surface of the wing forward of the ailerons. The devices were tested on a small parasol monoplane. Experienced gained in the use of flaps during these tests has indicated the desirability of a flap that can be operated quickly and easily...|$|R
40|$|In last decades, several {{research}} programs were founded worldwide {{to exploit the}} potentialities of the morphing concepts, especially to improve aerodynamic efficiency, and so reduce fuel consumption. Among these, the CRIAQ MDO- 505 project represents the first joined research program between Canadian and Italian academies, research centers and leading industries. The aim of the project is to design, manufacture and tests in wind tunnel facilities a morphing wing tip for a Bombardier-type aircraft controlled by electric actuators and pressure sensors. In such framework, the authors intensively worked on the flutter clearance demonstration of the wind tunnel wing model equipped with a full-scale variable-camber aileron driven by load-bearing electro-mechanical actuators. Rational approaches were implemented in order to simulate the effects induced by variations of aileron actuator's stiffness on the aeroelastic behavior of the wing. Reliable models were properly implemented to enable fast aeroelastic analyses covering several configuration cases {{in order to prove}} clearance from any dynamic instability (flutter) up to 1. 2 times the maximum flow speed expected during Wind Tunnel Tests. Finite-element models were properly developed in order to obtain and implement wing model modal parameters (modes shapes, frequencies, generalized masses, damping) in SANDYÂ®, an in-house developed code, that was used for the definition of the coupled aero-structural model {{as well as for the}} solution of aeroelastic stability equations by means of theoretical modes association in frequency domain. Obtained results were finally arranged in a diagram showing trend of the flutter speed with respect to changes in control surface harmonic covering a wide range of values for the stiffness of the <b>aileron</b> (<b>external)</b> actuator...|$|R
