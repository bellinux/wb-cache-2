5000|$|In the US {{what is now}} the US Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) was {{established}} in 1930 as the ICYRA. [...] Collegiate dinghy sailing in the US blossomed in 1934-36 with initiatives taken by Princeton with its 'Tiger' dinghies (1934), MIT (the famous Pavilion was founded and built in 1935 at the instigation of Walter C. 'Jack' Wood), and Brown (1936). The initial emphasis of the ICSA was very much on fleet racing (see Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association for historical details), but during the 1930s, team racing between individual colleges started to emerge - with 2 to 4 colleges meeting up, each fielding 2 to 5 boats. [...] After World War II collegiate sailing spread across the US and parts of Canada, with ICSA membership rapidly growing to modern numbers. George O’Day (Harvard), Harry Anderson (Yale) and Bill Cox Sr. (Princeton) all helped develop the ICYRA team race rules in the 1940s, and these were the forerunners of the NAYRU (now US Sailing) and International Yacht Racing Union (later International Sailing Federation or ISAF, now World Sailing) team race rules. [...] (<b>International</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of the Racing Rules of Sailing did not take place until 1960.) [...] A regional team racing championship, four-a-side format, first took place in 1950 in the New England District (now 'Conference') for the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy - a separate trophy from the new Fowle Trophy that is awarded to the best college across all 6 national ICSA championships. National team racing for the Walter C. Wood Trophy, four-a-side format, commenced in 1960 between teams formed from colleges within a particular ICSA district or 'conference', and results from 1970 are available online [...] From 1977 competing teams have been limited to sailors from one college, and Rhode Island University was the first (1977) winner of the current 'individual college' team racing championship for the Wood Trophy. [...] Across the border in Canada, intercollegiate sailing has also grown strong since the late 1990s. [...] The Wood Trophy now runs on a three-a-side format because of the greater ease of accommodating 6 sailors in the one car! [...] Courses evolved to current formats in the 2000s.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{interviews}} and documentary research, this paper explores {{the nature of}} <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of pharmaceutical regulation. The relationships between <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> trade interests in market expansion and the regulatory state are examined.

It is argued that this process is lowering regulatory standards regarding drug safety and is making the regulatory state more vulnerable to capture by industrial interests. This is accentuated by the misrepresentation of societal and political judgements as technical calculations and a concomitant lack of public accountability...|$|E

40|$|Background: Growth in {{international}} trade and capital flows has triggered a rising economic integration. Because of these developments {{there has been an}} international homogenising effect upon many customs, practices and institutions. In business life it led among other things to a desire to harmonise Accounting Standards among countries. Purpose: Our purpose is to answer the question: What is the <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> process of Accounting Standards, what is its status quo and how important is the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) in it? Realisation: In order to fulfil this purpose, we have chosen a descriptive approach, which is based on secondary data from textbooks, articles and homepages. Result: The <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of Accounting Standards is a process, which brings international Accounting Standards into some sort of agreement, in order to achieve a common set of principles, according to which financial statements from different countries are prepared. With the support of the IASB of the European Union (EU), 7000 European companies have to use International Accounting Standards (IAS) beginning 2005. Furthermore, the long existing rejection of IAS of the U. S. seems to change. Co-ordination of agendas of both standard-setting boards (IASB and Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) have been announced. We conclude, that the IASB {{plays a major role in}} the field of <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> This could be explained with achievements of the IASB, as for example the International Organisation of Security Commissions (IOSCO) Endorsement, EU regulation or the recent agreement of FASB and IASB to co-ordinate their work...|$|E

40|$|In {{the project}} "Acute {{toxicity}} and risk assessment", {{one of the}} goals was to actively participate in activities that promote <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) concept. At the international level, the Joint Meeting of Pesticides Residues of the WHO and FAO develops international harmonised guidance for setting the ARfD in which RIVM/SIR contributes. A final EU guidance document is not yet released but the EU guidance will probably follow the WHO strategy in general. For acute food intake calculations, the introduction of probabilistic exposure tools is an important issue. <b>International</b> <b>harmonisation</b> as propmoted by VWS appears to be well developed now for pesticides but the following specific subjects will need further (policy) attention: 1) use of ARfD for both preventive risk assessment and inspection tasks, 2) use of ARfD in other chemical frameworks, 3) procedure for setting provisional national ARfD values for pesticides without an official European ARfD, 4) mixed sampling during inspection measurements (e. g. virtual cumulative exposure to various pesticides), and 5) (inter) national harmonisation of probabilistic exposure calculations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine and {{evaluate}} the internationalisation of Australian auditing standards by analysing the submissions to the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board&# 039;s (AUASB) strategic directions paper (SDP) and comparing the proposed and approved strategic directions frameworks of the AUASB. Design/methodology/approach - A content analysis of the submissions to the SDP is conducted to identify the extent of support, and arguments for and against the proposed strategic directions. This study attempts to find a link, if any, between the proposed strategic directions, the views expressed by the stakeholders, and the final set of strategic directions issued by Australia&# 039;s Financial Reporting Council. Findings - Overall, the final set of strategic directions released in April 2005 are consistent with the views expressed in the submissions, which support minimal divergence from International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and using the ISAs as the base for developing Australian auditing standards. Major changes from the SDP include a requirement for the AUASB to undertake research and monitor auditing standards issued by national standard setters. However, the AUASB is no longer obliged to contribute to the international standard arena and need only have regard to any program initiated by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study provide an insight into the future of Australia&# 039;s role in the international arena and increase awareness of stakeholders&# 039; views on the <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of auditing standards. Originality/value - While there have been several studies examining the <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of accounting standards, there is comparatively little research on the <b>international</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of auditing standards.

40|$|Despite {{attempts}} to secure harmonisation of accounting practice, significant variations in accounting rules and practice continue to arise in European countries, variations which {{give rise to}} compliance costs for multinational companies.

The work is based upon {{a series of interviews}} carried out with leading accounting practitioners in the three countries during 1996 - 97.
