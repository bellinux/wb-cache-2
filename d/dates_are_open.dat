50|$|As an example, archaeologists divide human {{occupation}} of northeast Minnesota into numerous time periods. They are: the Paleo-Indian period from 7,000 years ago (5000 BC) extending {{back to an}} uncertain time after the glaciers receded from the last Ice Age; the Archaic period from 2,500 to 7,000 years ago (5000-500 BC); the Initial Woodland period from 2,500 to 1,300 years ago (500 BC-700 AD); the Terminal Woodland period from 1,300 to 400 years ago (700-1600 AD); and the historical period after that time. (Huber 2001: 34-52). These rough <b>dates</b> <b>are</b> <b>open</b> to debate and vary by location in the state.In general, two lines of inquiry have focused on archaeological wild rice: 1) The radiocarbon dating of charred wild rice seeds or the associated charcoal left behind during the parching stage of rice production, and 2) Examination of preserved wild rice seeds associated with specific prehistoric pottery styles found in excavations of processing sites. Different pottery styles in northern Minnesota are linked to certain times in the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods stretching from around 500 BC {{to the time of}} contact between indigenous peoples and Europeans. To place this in context, “Although ceramics may have appeared as early as 2,000 BC in the southeastern United States, it is about 1,500 years later that they became evident in the Midwest” (Anfinson 1979). After European contact, indigenous wild rice processors generally abandoned ceramic vessels in favor of metal kettles (Hilger 1951/1992: 148).|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} problem of {{enforcing}} a virtual holonomic constraint (VHC) on a mechanical system with degree of underactuation one while simultaneously stabilizing a closed orbit on the constraint manifold. This problem, which to <b>date</b> <b>is</b> <b>open,</b> arises when designing controllers to induce complex repetitive motions in robots. In this paper, we propose a solution which relies on the parameterization of the VHC by the output of a double integrator. While the original control inputs are used to enforce the VHC, the control input of the double-integrator is designed to asymptotically stabilize the closed orbit and make {{the state of the}} double-integrator converge to zero. The proposed design is applied to {{the problem of}} making a PVTOL aircraft follow a circle on the vertical plane with a desired speed profile, while guaranteeing that the aircraft does not roll over for suitable initial conditions.
