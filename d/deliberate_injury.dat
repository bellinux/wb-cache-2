She would have expressed her resolve as before; but it was a form out of which the blood had been sucked--no more a part of quivering life than the [...] "God's will be done" [...] of one who is eagerly watching chances. She did not mean to accept Grandcourt; from the first moment of receiving his letter she had meant to refuse him; still, that could not but prompt her to look the unwelcome reasons full in the face until she had a little less awe of them, could not hinder her imagination from filling out her knowledge in various ways, some of which seemed to change the aspect of what she knew. By dint of looking at a dubious object with a constructive imagination, who can give it twenty different shapes. Her indistinct grounds of hesitation before the interview at the Whispering Stones, at present counted for nothing; they were all merged in the final repulsion. If it had not been for that day in Cardell Chase, she said to herself now, there {{would have been}} no obstacle to her marrying Grandcourt. On that day and after it, she had not reasoned and balanced; she had acted with a force of impulse against which all questioning was no more than a voice against a torrent. The impulse had come--not only from her maidenly pride and jealousy, not only from the shock of another woman's calamity thrust close on her vision, but--from her dread of wrong-doing, which was vague, it was true, and aloof from the daily details of her life, but not the less strong. Whatever was accepted as consistent with being a lady she had no scruple about; but from the dim region of what was called disgraceful, wrong, guilty, she shrunk with mingled pride and terror; and even apart from shame, her feeling would have made her place any <b>deliberate</b> <b>injury</b> of another in the region of guilt.|$|E

Peculiarities of epidemiology, types of burn, pattern of injuries, complications, and outcome of burn care were reviewed. There were no broad-based overview statistical data on burns in Nigeria in all the articles reviewed. There was no documentation on the regionalization of care and there were no national databases. All reports on epidemiology were hospital-based. Flame is emerging as the predominant cause of burns, and burn injury is occurring increasingly away from the domestic setting.

Inaccuracy in emotion categorization can lead to inadequate social behavior, commonly seen in various psychiatric disorders. Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a psychiatric symptom involving <b>deliberate</b> self-inflicted <b>injury</b> of one’s body, without intent to die. NSSI has been regarded as a dysfunctional coping strategy for managing intensely difficult feelings. Difficulties in social interactions have been reported by individuals who engage in NSSI, which {{may be related to}} their emotion categorization performance. Participants (17 - 25 yrs) with a history of NSSI and healthy controls viewed videos of faces changing over 10 s from neutral to a prototypical expression of sadness, disgust, surprise, fear, anger or happiness. They were instructed to stop each video as soon as they felt they recognized the emotion presented, thus indicating the minimum intensity of expression needed for categorization. They were then asked to categorize the expression. Minimum facial expression intensity, accuracy of categorization, and reaction time were the behavioral dependent variables of interest. NSSI participants showed significant advantages compared to controls in their ability to categorize negative emotion expressions, specifically fear, anger, disgust, and sadness. They also were able to recognize the ambiguous emotion of surprise at a lower stimulus intensity. To date, treatments for NSSI have high drop-out rates. Results from this research could be used to inform further development of therapies for the alleviation or prevention of NSSI. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. In Australasia, the USA, and Canada, {{certified}} gynecologic oncologists (CGO) {{are expected}} to be competent in performing intestinal, urological, and vascular procedures relevant to gynecologic oncology. This competency may be difficult to achieve and experience with simulation rather than human patients may be preferable during initial training. We present the structure, objectives, rationale, and outcomes for a surgical skill workshop aimed to improve the performance of fellows in gynecologic oncology. Workshop structure. The overall objective of the workshop is the prevention and management of complications in gynecologic oncology surgery. Preworkshop preparation includes anatomical illustrations to guide reading and a training video describing surgical procedures and the relevant aspects of ovine and porcine anatomy. There are four modules: (i) Anatomy includes an interactive lecture, cadaveric dissection, and examination of prosections. (ii) Porcine surgery involves the demonstration, practice, and learning of techniques needed to deal with unexpected or <b>deliberate</b> operative <b>injury</b> to bowel, bladder, ureter, and major blood vessels and performance of less common operations. (iii) Live ovine surgery allows further supervised practice of these procedures plus the repair of vascular injury. (iv) Case presentations allow each participant to present a complicated case in a facilitated group session with discussion and feedback from their peers. This session is controlled, nonthreatening, and interactive. Conclusion. Participant feedback and evaluation suggests that this workshop format and the opportunity to practice less common procedures are helpful to clinical practice. This educational model is presented in the hope that it may act as a template for the development of similar programs for fellows in other countries...|$|R
40|$|Assumptions and aims: In {{recent years}} we have been observing an {{increasing}} number of adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. These are often direct self-mutilations, defined as <b>deliberate</b> body <b>injuries.</b> The intention of such behaviours is physical self-injuring to reduce mental pain, relieve emotional tension and anxiety. This is accompanied by the sense of being “rewarded”. The study is aimed at analysing the correlation between the severity of general hostility and its respective subscales assessed by the Buss-Durkee Inventory on Moods and humours and the occurrence of selfmutilations in a group of adolescents with superficial self-mutilations. Material and methods: The examined population consisted of 67 persons aged 14 - 18 years, of both genders. Qualified to the examined group were 42 adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. The control group consisted of 25 persons selected according to age and gender who did not exhibit such behaviours. Excluded from the study were subjects with depressive, psychotic disorders as well as significant somatic disorders, and those who used psychotropic drugs and psychoactive substances. The respondents completed the Buss-Durkee Inventory assessing the level of general hostility and its seven subscales: direct aggressiveness consisting of physical and verbal aggressiveness, indirect aggressiveness, resentment, negativism, suspiciousness and irritability. A separate scale assessed the sense of guilt. Conclusions: 1) Self-mutilations in the examined group were associated with severity of aggressiveness directed outwards (measured both by its general level and in respective subscales). 2) Self-mutilating patients require therapeutic measures (psychotherapeutic and pharmacological) aimed at reduction not only of autoaggression but also aggression directed outwards...|$|R

5000|$|Cheating {{in sports}} is the {{intentional}} breaking of rules {{in order to}} obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as [...] "doping"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and <b>deliberate</b> harassment or <b>injury</b> to competitors.High profile examples of alleged doping cheating include Lance Armstrong's use of steroids in professional cycling - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - Ben Johnson's disqualification following the 100 metres final at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and admissions of steroid use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as José Canseco and Ken Caminiti. A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in figure skating when Tonya Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break Nancy Kerrigan's leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the 1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, when Diego Maradona used his hand to punch the ball into the goal of England goalkeeper Peter Shilton.

Besides, some psychological concepts such as guilt, anxiety and frustration are also used as the supporting concepts in the analysis. Through the analysis, I find out some problems, which are faced by Lavinia as the effects of her revenge. She feels guilty although she has tried many things to avoid facing the reality of her guilt. In addition, she feels anxious that people surround her will discover everything she has done in the past and that will make them condemn and hate her. Moreover, she also becomes frustrated in her effort to pursue happiness in life by canceling her marriage with Peter as she realizes that her past always haunts her and if someday Peter finds it out, it will bring about separation with Peter. Finally, I conclude that Lavinia?s guilty feeling, anxiety and frustration are the effects of her revenge and these effects, which make her unable to obtain happiness in life, are actually the consequences that she has to face for the rest of her life...|$|R
