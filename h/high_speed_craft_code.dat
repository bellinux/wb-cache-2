40|$|For {{very high}} speed marine crafts the {{aerodynamic}} forces can {{become of the}} same order of magnitude as the hydrodynamic ones, especially for small vessels. Although these forces can lead to instability issues in some cases, they can also offer a new range of possibilities to sustain {{the weight of the}} craft. The vessel can be equipped with aerodynamic lifting surfaces in order to alleviate the weight of the vehicle, leading to a lower effective displacement, hence lower resistance and required power. The estimation of the total weight of the vehicle and of its distribution is of paramount importance, since it strongly affects the whole design process. Due to the lack of commercially established AAMV configurations, and due to the substantial differences between AAMV and other fast vehicles, regressions based on historical data derived from present and past vehicles are not available. The proposed approach is therefore based on the <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Craft</b> <b>Code</b> and on first principles of structural engineering, considering both global and local behaviour of structural components. The developed procedure works out an estimate of the weight of the structure using as input data only the main characteristics of the AAMV under design and it represents a starting point in the scantling design of an AAMV in the first steps of the design spiral...|$|E
40|$|The design {{reliability}} of the theory applied when calculating the sensitivity of shafting alignment must be determined especially at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement and calculation for the vertical static bearing loads (reaction forces) and pressures {{in order to obtain}} positive uniform values, which have to comply with the design requirements of the <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Craft</b> <b>Code</b> of Classification Society. Any poor design of shafting arrangement for each vertical static bearing location and/or bearing off-set design value may cause a failed shafting alignment calculation and a non-uniform bearing load or over excessive bearing load and pressure on the propulsion shaft stern tube/strut supporting bearing and possible further damage, for example, excessive wastage and/or crack on a damaged aft shaft strut bearing for a high speed craft. The objective {{of this study was to}} find and verify the design {{reliability of}} the applied theoretical method for calculating the suitable design values of each vertical static bearing load and pressure on the propulsion shafting system at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement. The design values for each vertical static bearing load and pressure calculated by theoretical design methodologies of the finite element method (FEM) and the three moment equation method (TMEM) were compared with the shipyard original design values for the same design case of propulsion shafting system. The design deviation of the vertical static bearing from the shipyard original design values was determined in order to decide which design methodology (TMEM or FEM) would be adopted and developed for further numerical algorithm design on shafting alignment optimization. According to the obtained results, both the FEM and the TMEM theoretical design accuracy and reliability were well matched with the shipyard original design values. In addition, the TMEM design results for each static bearing load and pressure proved to be more close to the shipyard original design values...|$|E
40|$|Expansion {{of marine}} {{transport}} and {{growing number of}} high speed vessels travelling in the neighbourhood of the coastline significantly {{increase the risk of}} the crash on the sea. Within the existing high speed craft legislations there are no regulations related to prediction of the vessel occupants injury and trauma. Former research has exposed the similarities between the high speed vessel crash and automotive collision enabling the transfer of advanced crash safety technologies between the automotive and marine. This paper investigates the application of the most recent CAE automotive safety technologies to predict the injuries of high speed Cruise Logistics Ferry (CLF) occupants in 40 knots crash with a harbour peer. At first, the probability of occupant injuries was studied using a 50 th percentile HYBRID III standing crash test dummy model. The study considered various occupant positions within the boat cabin for two different cabin orientations. The investigation was then followed by computer analyses utilising {{the state of the art}} Total Human computer Model for Safety (THUMS) to evaluate the localised passenger traumatology. This model is the most advanced human computer model available, capable of computing injury risks at organ levels. Results from the analyses using both models showed that the standing HYBRID III dummy was suitable to assess the overall risk of occupants' injuries in a cabin design context, while the THUMS model added detailed trauma injuries for selected occupant locations. The results of both investigation indicated very high risk of life changing injuries or even death to the boat occupant within the cabin. A strong relationship between the probability of severe injury and the distance between the passenger and any obstacle in the cabin was found. In conclusion, the research is proposing a design methodology for cabin occupant protection based on the location of each individual passenger relative to obstacles and the associate risk of injury. This is in stark contrast to the general design guidelines of the <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Craft</b> <b>code</b> (2000) which are based on threshold values of a global collision design acceleration...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>speeds</b> of ferries {{has been developed}} in recent years leading to a target ship mission profile: transport of cars and passengers along routes of about 150 / 200 nautical miles. In this context the University of Genova, Napoli and Trieste, in a joint research project, started studying some trimaran concept ships, competitors of the existing monohull <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> passenger ferries. Many investigations {{have been carried out}} about hydrodynamic and sea keeping performances aiming to improve speed and comfort of passengers. However, some of the structural design problems are still pending. As a matter of facts, in last years Classification Societies succeeded in developing quite complete codes suggesting simplified but reliable formulations for the scantling of fast units structures; <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Craft</b> <b>codes</b> (HSC) are at present widely used for new monohull and catamaran passenger vessels. Nevertheless trimaran ships are not included and the application of HSC rules to this kind of vessels appears unfair without considering substantial differences in terms of ship’s motions and structural resistance definition. Direct calculations should then be considered for this kind of vessels particularly for the definition of the resistance of the whole structure which should take into account longitudinal, transversal and horizontal bending moments together with longitudinal and transversal torque acting on the three hulls. The definition of these loads can be performed with accuracy by using three-dimensional seakeeping analysis based on panel methods. In a preliminary stage simplified methods based on quasi-static wave approach can be sufficient for the definition of complete, three-dimensional load sets and the scantling of the main structural elements of the main and side hulls. The structural resistance can be assessed by finite element models of the structure studied under the action of the previously calculated load sets. A refinement of the model can be carried out and studied in the worst load condition. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the application of the above procedure to a large trimaran fast ferry. In the research framework the complete structural design of the vessel has been obtained...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis, done {{as a part of}} the ongoing {{research}} projects ”Vattenvägen 365 ” and ”LightIce - Light weight marine vessels operating in brash Ice”. This work is a study of the design of a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft,</b> intended for use in the public transportation network in the Stockholm area. Emphasis is put on investigating the consequences of the ice conditions in the area during winter. The work is primarily done as a case study, based on the design of a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> passenger vessel, intended to navigate in ice. The ice conditions considered are light ice conditions, like brash ice and thin ice sheets. In connection with the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> design, work is done on the eﬀect of the choice of material concept. The scope of the work is as follows. To look into the existing literature on the topics of ice loads on <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>crafts</b> and the use of lightweight materials in the construction of ice-going vessels. Create an initial design of a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> suitable for passenger transportation in the Stockholm area. Gain insight into the ice loading on a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft,</b> and looking into the use of composite and lightweight materials. A literature review on literature related to ice loading of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>crafts</b> is done. A vessel is brought into the initial design stage, basing the design on a operational proﬁle developed for a suggested route for commuter transportation in the Stockholm area. This <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> is used as a basis for comparison of diﬀerent methods for estimation of ice loading. Testing is planned to investigate the ice loading of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>crafts,</b> based on the operational proﬁle and vessel design. In connection with testing, a loading scenario is created by estimating the expected maximum ice thickness during a winter in the intended area of operation, an impact scenario is deﬁned and work is done with regards to estimation of ice ﬂoe size and modelling of the impact between the vessel under normal operational conditions and an ice ﬂoe. For the testing, full scale hull panels are designed in four diﬀerent materials, both metal and composite. Testing is planned using the deﬁned loading and the designed hull panels.

For the aluminum survey, {{a large amount of}} scientic papers and books related to the application of aluminum in shipbuilding industry were re-viewed while for the investigation of hull structure design, several designs of similar craft as well as all the classication rules for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> were examined. The parametric model was developed on Abaqus nite ele-ment analysis software with the help of Python programming language. The study of the idealizations and the assumptions of the semi-empirical design methods was performed on a model derived by the parametric model with scanltings determined by the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> classication rules of ABS. The review on aluminum showed that only specic alloys can be applied on marine applications. It also showed that the eect of reduced mechanical properties due to welding could be decreased by introducing new welding and manufacturing techniques. The study regarding the hull structure de-sign processes indicated that <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> are still designed according to semi-empirical classication rules but it also showed that there is ten- dency of transiting on direct calculation methods. The developed paramet-ric model does decrease the modeling time since it is capable of modeling numerous structural arrangements. The analysis related to the idealizations and the assumptions of the semi-empirical design methods revealed that the structural hierarchy idealization and the method of dening boundary by handbook type formulas are applicable for the particular structure while the interaction eect among the structural members is only possible to be studied by detailed modeling techniques...|$|R

40|$|Extreme {{vibration}} {{has been}} reported for small, <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> in the maritime sector, with performance and health threatening effects on boat operators and crew. Musculoskeletal injuries are an enduring problem for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> passengers. Spinal or joint injuries and neurological disorders may occur from repetitive pounding over rough water, continued vibration and single impact events. The risk from whole body vibration (WBV) induced through the small vessels mainly depends on time spent on the craft, which can’t be changed in a military scenario; {{as well as the}} number of shocks and jolts, and their magnitude and frequency. In the European Union for example, physical agents directives require all employers to control exposure to a number of physical agents including noise and vibration. The EC Vibration Directive 2002 / 44 /EC then sets out regulations for the control of health and safety risks from the exposure of workers to hand arm vibration (HAV) and WBV in the workplace. Australia has exposure standards relating to WBV, AS 2670. 1 - 2001 – Evaluation of human exposure to whole body vibration. This standard is identical to the ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997, Mechanical vibration and shock – Evaluation of human exposure to whole-body vibration. Currently, none of the jurisdictions in Australia have specific regulations for vibration exposures in workplaces. However vibration is mentioned to varying degrees in their general regulations, codes of practice and guidance material. WBV on <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> is normally caused by “continuous 'hammering' from short steep seas or wind against tide conditions.

40|$|Using {{scantling}} codes such as DNV or ISO {{for designing}} <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> {{has been a}} routine for many constructors. However, the validity of these design methods are to be questioned, especially when dealing with modern material concepts and structural layouts, since {{they are based on}} data from ships designed in the 1960 ies and 1970 ies using semi-empirical methods containing substantial uncertainties and limitations.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the capability of a numerical method {{for use in the}} context of a procedure for designing <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft.</b> A numerical model is used to predict the motions of a planing craft in both regular and irregular waves. The model is based on non-linear strip theory, through calculation of the forces occurring on wedge impact. This numerical model and its limitations are well understood for lower planing speeds (up to a length based Froude number of around 1. 2). This paper investigates the limitations and accuracy for <b>higher</b> <b>speed</b> <b>craft</b> (Froude number around 3). At present there is an inadequate knowledge of the model performance at these speeds. Lower speed validation is carried out using results from published experiments although this data does not extend to the <b>higher</b> <b>speeds.</b> Validation of the model at <b>higher</b> <b>speeds</b> is achieved using experimental data attained from testing two scale models: A wave piercing rigid inflatable boat (RIB) and an Atlantic 21 RIB. The experiments are conducted in a range of regular wave frequencies for three wave height together with a realistic JONSWAP sea spectrum.
