5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the <b>heeling</b> effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was <b>heeling,</b> many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
25|$|Catamarans rely {{primarily}} on form stability to resist <b>heeling</b> and capsize. Comparison of <b>heeling</b> stability of a rectangular-cross section monohull of beam, B, compared with two catamaran hulls of width B/2, {{separated by a}} distance, 2×B, determines that the catamaran has an initial resistance to <b>heeling</b> that is seven {{times that of the}} monohull. Compared with a monohull, a cruising catamaran sailboat has a high initial resistance to <b>heeling</b> and capsize—a fifty-footer requires four times the force to initiate a capsize than an equivalent monohull.|$|E

In this clinical trial 126 patients suffering from <b>heel</b> pain were treated medically (Oral NSAID, <b>heel</b> pad and local steroid injection). According to imaging study patients were divided in two groups (group one with <b>heel</b> spur, and group two without <b>heel</b> spur). After 4 weeks follow up improvement of <b>heel</b> pain occurred in 62 cases of group two and 34 cases of group one. Thus <b>heel</b> spur causes resistance to medical therapy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Heel</b> pad syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>heel</b> fat pad syndrome, <b>heel</b> pad atrophy and <b>heel</b> fat pad atrophy, is a pain that occurs {{in the center of}} the <b>heel.</b> It is {{typically}} due to atrophy of the fat pad which makes up the <b>heel.</b> Risk factors include obesity.

25|$|Like the old Wäinämöinen, Jääkarhu had a <b>heeling</b> {{system with}} two pumps capable of {{transferring}} 650 tons of ballast water per hour between side tanks, <b>heeling</b> the vessel {{up to five}} degrees in ten minutes. In addition, she had six centrifugal pumps for moving 100 tons of water in five minutes between the fore and aft peak tanks to adjust her trim and release the icebreaker from compressive ice. For escort operations she had a towing winch and a stern notch that was considerably larger than in the older icebreakers. Her single piece cast iron rudder weighed 9 tons.|$|E
25|$|The Bruce foil is a foil that {{provides}} a lateral resistance with zero <b>heeling</b> moment by placing the foil to either {{or both of the}} leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of <b>heeling</b> forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a <b>heeling</b> pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. <b>Heeling</b> {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E

25|$|The {{attack was}} resumed the next morning, when, {{after a night}} war council, the Ottomans {{attacked}} in two groups which separately attempted to capture the Capitana (or flagship) and the Amiranta (or secondary ship). After approaching inside {{the range of the}} Spanish muskets, the galleys were subjected to the heavy gunfire of the entire Spanish flotilla. Unable to board the Spanish ships, the Ottoman force withdrew in the evening with another 10 galleys <b>heeling</b> over.|$|E
25|$|That night a new {{council of}} war {{took place during}} which the Turks decided to resume the action at dawn. After a speech that boosted their morale, the Ottomans {{attacked}} with great resolve and managed to approach Rivera's flagship from a more favorable angle in order to exploit her blind spot. Nevertheless, the Spanish commander, who had foreseen such a possibility, ordered that the Santiago move to his ship's bow. This maneuver exposed the Turkish galleys to more heavy gunfire which inflicted severe damage, finally forcing the Ottoman force to withdraw at 3:00pm with another galley sunk, two dismasted and 17 others severely damaged or <b>heeling</b> over.|$|E
25|$|The first revenue train load was transported on 13 July 1910. The first shipload of ore was 2,000 tonnes sent in October 1910 with SS Bengal. The ship sank with no survivors. The {{cause was}} {{probably}} that the forty-year-old ship had insufficient bulkheads. The second ship, SS Svend, sank off Valdersund. The third vessel, SS Aguilla, {{was loaded with}} 3,100 tonnes, suffered <b>heeling,</b> but was {{able to return to}} Kirkenes. Wiull was hired as director of operations in 1910, and the following year Fr. H. Behrens was appointed managing director. Good market conditions resulted in the company deciding in 1911 to increase the facilities capacity to 500,000 tonnes per year, costing NOK3million. This involved installing a new crusher, ordering two new locomotives and three new steam shovels and an expansion of the briquette and separation plant. The expansion was completed in 1911.|$|E

25|$|With {{the long}} toe, low <b>heel</b> {{conformation}} can come contracted <b>heels</b> (narrowing of the <b>heel)</b> which further compresses the navicular bone along with sheared <b>heels</b> adding more stress to the tendons and navicular bones.|$|R
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{consisted of}} retrofitting a bulbous bow, faired {{to the existing}} icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by KaMeWa, to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated <b>heeling</b> tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to , which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new incinerator {{to deal with the}} shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the Wärtsilä Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the command}} of the judge, the handler will stand the dog and leave from heel position. The handler will go a {{distance}} of approximately 6 feet and the judge will perform a cursory exam, touching the head, shoulders and hips, and when completed the judge will instruct the handler to return. The handler {{will return to the}} dog, going around behind it, and return to heel position. A variation on this exercise is used in advanced classes called the stand for examination. At the end of the <b>heeling</b> pattern instead of ordering the team to halt the judge will order the handler to stand their dog. While moving the handler will give the command and the dog must immediately stop while the handler continues moving to a point about 10 feet away. The judge will then approach and perform a more thorough exam of the dog and at the completion of the exam the dog is instructed to return directly to heel position WITHOUT coming to a front.|$|E
500|$|Leaving port {{with a broad}} {{white flag}} bearing the motto [...] "Free Trade and Sailors' Rights", Chesapeake met with Shannon near 5pm that afternoon. During six minutes of firing, each ship managed two full {{broadside}}s. Chesapeakes first broadside was fired while the ship was <b>heeling,</b> causing most hits on Shannon to strike the water or waterline causing little damage to Shannon although carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. A second round of fire was more effective, landing hits on Shannon 's 12 pounder shot locker. Chesapeake 's 32 lb carronades punished Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannon 's nine pounder bow gun. However Chesapeake suffered far more heavily in the exchange as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews and crippling losses {{to the men and}} officers on Chesapeakes quarterdeck. A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel itself was destroyed. At the same time, her foretopsail halyard was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability.|$|E

500|$|The air {{commander}} aboard Ark Royal—aware {{that the}} surviving Dorniers would report {{the location of}} the British ships—ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied. Four Junkers Ju 88 bombers of the Luftwaffe bomber wing KG 30 soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a [...] bomb at the carrier. Ark Royal turned hard to starboard, <b>heeling</b> over and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean [...] off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not Ark Royal. Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that Ark Royal had sunk. To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain's allies, Winston Churchill personally reassured United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view Ark Royal in dock. The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service. This was an embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda.|$|E
500|$|During {{his long}} period {{in command of}} Shannon, Captain Philip Broke of the Royal Navy {{introduced}} many practical refinements to his 'great guns', which were virtually unheard of elsewhere in contemporary naval gunnery. He had 'dispart sights' fitted to his 18-pounder long guns, which improved aiming as they compensated for the narrowing of the barrels from the breech to the muzzle. He had adjustable tangent sights that would give accuracy at different ranges. He had the elevating 'quoins' (wedge-shaped pieces of wood placed under the breech) of his long guns grooved to mark various degrees of elevation so that his guns could be reliably levelled to fire horizontally in any state of <b>heeling</b> of the ship under a press of sail. [...] The carronades were similarly treated, but the elevating screws on these cannon were marked in paint. As the decks of contemporary ships curved upwards towards the stern and bows, he cut down the wheels on the [...] "up-slope" [...] side of each cannon's carriage in order that all guns were level with the horizon. He also introduced a system where bearings were incised into the deck next to each gun; fire could then be directed to any bearing independent of the ability of any particular gun crew to see the target. Fire from the whole battery could also be focused on any part of an enemy ship.|$|E

40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe construction that could enter the current high <b>heel</b> market. The impact of high <b>heel</b> shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high <b>heel</b> shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the <b>heel</b> to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable <b>heels</b> fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high <b>heel</b> that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, <b>heel</b> removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high <b>heel</b> shoes to learn and leverage the current high <b>heel</b> shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high <b>heel</b> shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable <b>heel</b> that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high <b>heel.</b> (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high <b>heel</b> to maintain high <b>heel</b> stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high <b>heel</b> infrastructure. The development of the detachable high <b>heel</b> construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high <b>heel</b> construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)
