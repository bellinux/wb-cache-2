5000|$|The {{back of the}} phaser has {{a simple}} LED display. When a pack <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>energised,</b> there is a number above a [...] "U" [...] showing. The number is the pack's ID number. The U means that the pack is [...] "Un-energized." [...] When a pack is on during normal play, the top number {{is the number of}} lives {{remaining}}, the bottom is the number of shots (when a player is out of shots, they lose a life, getting a [...] "Good Shot" [...] resets the shot counter). When a player re-energizes, the display shows how many times the player has energised. When a player is out of lives, the display flashes the amount of time left in the game. If a player holds the trigger down for three seconds, either display will show the time remaining or a [...] "bomb" [...] will be triggered that can deactivate all vests around the player, including those on the same team.|$|E
40|$|Two-degree-of-freedom motors {{are capable}} of {{producing}} linear, rotary, and helical motion, and thus have widespread applications in special industries. In this study, a new concept- static coupling effect is studied in the two-degree-of-freedom direct-drive induction motor (2 DoFDDIM). The proposed approach {{is based on the}} image method and the three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element method. The image method model is established to analyse its reasons and predict the main effects, which are then verified by the proposed 3 D finite-element static coupling model and experiments. The induced voltages and currents are produced in the static part and induced torque or force is obtained, even though the static part <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>energised.</b> It is concluded that the static coupling effect increases with the supply frequency and is influenced by the stator winding configuration. Thus, the existence of the static coupling effect is confirmed, which {{must be taken into account}} in future optimisation and precise control of the 2 DoFDDIM...|$|E
50|$|There are two {{variants}} of wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} systems for installation on overhead electricity power lines: they differ {{in the nature of}} the host conductor. When the host conductor is a phase-wire, one of the conductors that carry the electric current in the electricity network, a phase-to-ground insulator is required at every location where the wrapped cable leaves the conductor. The phase-to-ground (PTG) insulator is a device that provides electrical isolation whilst allowing optical continuity. This means that the fibre optic cable and joint closures on the grounded side of the PTG can be accessed and worked on safely, even if the overhead line is energised to full system voltage. The simpler system is designed to be installed on the earth-wire (also known as ground-wire or shield wire) of the overhead line. Because earth-wires <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>energised</b> in service, this type of installation does not require a phase-to-ground insulator.|$|R
50|$|If {{the signal}} {{associated}} with the ramp was at caution, the ramp would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>energised.</b> The ramp would lift the shoe on the passing locomotive and start a timer sequence {{at the same time}} sounding a horn on the footplate. If the driver failed to acknowledge this warning within a preset time, the brakes of the train would be applied. In testing, the GWR demonstrated the effectiveness of this system by sending an express train at full speed past a distant signal at Caution. The train was brought safely to a stand before reaching the home signal.|$|R
5000|$|On Rotten Tomatoes, Secret Window has {{a rating}} of 46% based on 160 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 (mixed or average reviews) out of 100. Roger Ebert awarded it three stars out of a {{possible}} four, stating that [...] "Secret Window could add up to a straight-faced thriller about things that go boo in the night, but Johnny Depp and director David Koepp ... have too much style to let that happen." [...] He continues by noting that [...] "the story is more entertaining as it rolls along than it is when it gets to the finish line. But at least King uses his imagination right up to the end, and spares us the obligatory violent showdown that a lesser storyteller would have settled for." [...] On the other hand, Ian Nathan from Empire magazine only awarded the film 2 stars {{out of a possible}} 5, stating that [...] "The presence of the sublime Depp will be enough to get Secret Window noticed, but even his latest set of rattling eccentricities <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough to <b>energise</b> this deadbeat parlour trick." [...] It was a modest box office success, succeeding at recouping its budget of $40 million with a worldwide gross of $92 million.|$|R
5000|$|When the City and South London Railway {{was being}} reconstructed in 1922, {{a number of}} [...] "padded cell" [...] trailer cars - {{so-called}} because of their lack of windows - were stripped out, so that lead-acid batteries and charging resistances could {{be placed in the}} resulting space. Each car was then coupled to an electric locomotive, and the batteries were connected to the shoe fuses of the locomotive. The current rail shoes were removed, so that the batteries did <b>not</b> <b>energise</b> the rails. Recharging was arranged at certain points, by means of switches and cables connected to the supply that normally fed the rails.|$|R

Though comparatively uneducated, he was deeply read in the Book which it was his life's work to expound, and an undercurrent of intense feeling seemed to carry him along--and his hearers along with him--as he spoke. He did not shout or gesticulate: that made him all the more impressive. He did not speak of himself or his own feelings: that enabled his hearers to give undistracted attention to the message he had to deliver. He did <b>not</b> <b>energise.</b> On the contrary, {{it seemed as if}} he had some difficulty in restraining the superabundant energy that burned within him; and as people usually stand more or less in awe of that which they do not fully understand, they gave him credit, perhaps, for more power than he really possessed. At all events, <b>not</b> a sound <b>was</b> heard, save now and then a suppressed sob, as he preached Christ crucified to guilty sinners, and urged home the two [...] "messages" [...] with all the force of unstudied language, but well-considered and aptly put illustration and anecdote.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{determined}} {{the relative importance}} of the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient to the transport of d-[14 C]glucose and [14 C]glycylsarcosine (gly-sar) in rat kidney brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from superficial renal cortex. Electrogenic [14 C]gly-sar transport was first optimised by imposing a pH gradient (pHo = 5. 7, pHi = 8. 4) and an interior negative p. d. (using outwardly directed K+ gradient plus valinomycin). Under identical conditions (pHo = 5. 7, pHi = 8. 4), an acceleration f of initial d-[14 C]glucose (at 100 μM) transport by 2. 0 ± 0. 7 -fold was observed compared to no proton gradient (pHo = 8. 4, pHi = 8. 4). This increase was due primarily to an effect of external protons, since acidic conditions (pHo = pHi = 5. 7) also resulted in ann acceleration of d-glucose influx (2 -fold). The increase ind-glucose transport in the presence of external acidity was reduced by the uncoupler FCCP, {{even in the absence of}} a proton gradient. Furthermore, the increased d-glucose transport with external acidity in the presence of a proton gradient was insensitive to a K+ gradient-driven diffusion potential in the presence of valinomycin. In no instance was an overshoot accumulation ofd-[14 C]glucose observed in H+ gradient conditions. H+-stimulatedd-[14 C]glucose transport showed a linear dependence on d-glucose concentration up to 20 mMd-glucose, unlike electrogenic Na+-dependentd-glucose transport, whose Km was 1. 77 ± 0. 35 mM. In contrast, the initial rate of [14 C]gly-sar (100 μM) transport by the renal H+/di-tripeptide transporter was accelerated 15. 7 ± 3. 3 -fold and stimulated a marked overshoot of 5. 1 ± 0. 4 -fold over equilibrium values. Conversely, the electrogenic, Na+/glucose transporter could be readily demonstrated, whilst [14 C]gly-sar transport could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>energised</b> by an inward Na+ gradient. The absence of electrogenicd-glucose transport in H+ gradient conditions is clear evidence against H+/glucose cotransport in Na+-free conditions mediated by SGLT 2 (sodium-glucose transporter, renal cortex). Furthermore, since a proton gradient does not increase brush-border membraned-glucose uptake in Na+-rich media, it is unlikely that in vivo renald-glucose transport mediated via SGLT 2 may be energised by the transmembrane proton gradient...|$|R
