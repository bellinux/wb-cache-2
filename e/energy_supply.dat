5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even total primary <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> globally, has been motivated by {{global warming and}} other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} utilized on Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie grid {{also came}} under fire from critics. It is claimed that this technology, used to improve performance, safety, and reliability, made people in Quebec over-dependent on the power grid for their energy needs, since electricity, especially hydroelectric power, makes up over 40% of Quebec's <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b> This dependence, evidenced by the fact Ontario farmers had more backup generators than farmers in Quebec, can increase {{the severity of the}} consequences when the grid fails, as it did in January 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in {{economic}} terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar <b>Energy</b> <b>Supply</b> Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E

5|$|The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 {{megawatt}} (MW) {{solar photovoltaic}} {{power plant in}} Boulder City, Nevada. Sempra Generation began construction of the plant in January 2010 and the facility began generating electricity on December 1, 2010. At its construction peak more than 350 workers were installing the 775,000 First Solar panels on the 380 acre site. The power from Copper Mountain Solar Facility (and the adjacent 10 MW El Dorado Solar Power Plant) is being sold to Pacific Gas & Electric under separate 20-year contracts. Californian utilities were required to obtain 20 percent of their <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> from renewable energy sources {{by the end of}} 2010, increasing to 33 percent by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar <b>Energy</b> <b>Supply</b> Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} {{of electricity}} prices in demand response schemes and intermittency of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> necessitate {{the adoption of}} energy storage in microgrids. However, {{it is challenging to}} design effective real-time energy storage management strategies that can deliver assured optimality, without being hampered by the uncertainty of volatile electricity prices and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supplies.</b> This paper presents a simple effective online algorithm for the charging and discharging decisions of energy storage that minimizes the electricity cost in the presence of electricity price fluctuations and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supplies,</b> without relying on the future information of prices, demands or renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supplies.</b> The proposed algorithm is supported by a near-best worst-case guarantee (i. e., competitive ratio), as compared to the offline optimal decisions based on full future information. Furthermore, the algorithm can be adapted to take advantage of limited future information, if available. By simulations on real-world data, it is observed that the proposed algorithms can achieve satisfactory outcome in practice. Comment: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Smart Gri...|$|R
5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed). The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC).

5|$|The robot creator Doctor Light created two human-like robots with {{advanced}} artificial intelligence named Mega and Roll. Following this, he created eight more robots intended for industrial use: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, Elec Man, Time Man, and Oil Man. He received a Nobel Prize for Physics, and his old colleague and rival Doctor Wily has grown bitter {{for not being}} acknowledged {{for his work on}} the project. Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before Mega and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight industrial robots to attempt world domination. Mega volunteered to stop Wily and the robots and was converted into a fighting robot called Mega Man. After defeating all eight robots, Mega Man goes through Dr. Wily's fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, he surrenders and asks Mega Man to spare him.|$|E
