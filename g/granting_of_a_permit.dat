Cartwright argued that as this was an administrative tribunal, and not a judicial one, it was [...] "a law unto itself" [...] and did not need to base its decision on anything more than policy and expediency. Cartwright went on to argue that even if the commission were to be considered quasi-judicial, in which case procedural fairness guarantees would apply, that still would not entitle the plaintiff to monetary damages.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of monthly {{observations}} of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen {{content in the}} basin formed by Rupert and Holbcrg Inlets reveals greater vertical mixing than in most British Columbia inlets. The water temperature correlates with solar radiation while the salinity changes follow river runoff, in turn controlled by precipitation. The variation in dissolved oxygen appears due {{to a combination of}} biological influences and the influx of water. A model has been developed which ascribes the monthly fluctuations and vertical homogeneity to an accumulation of irregular mixing events associated with the tidal flow through Quatsino Narrows, a shallow connecting channel, Rupert and IIolberg Inlets (Fig. 1) near the northern end of Vancouver Island, pos-sess a shape typical of British Columbia fjords (Pickard 1956)) being elongated, narrow bodies of water with roughly paral-lel sides. Rupert Inlet is 10 km long, 1. 8 km wide, and has a mean midchannel depth of 110 m. IIolberg Inlet is 34 km long, 1. 3 km wide, and has a mean midchannel depth of 80 m (Pickard 1963). Together they form a basin of 170 m maximum depth, separated from Quatsino Sound and Neroutsos Inlet by Quatsino Narrows, a long, narrow channel with a sharp bend at its southern extreme. Its depth decreases northward, culminating in a sill of depth 18 m west of Makwazniht Island (Fig. 2). The principal river affecting the water properties of the Rupert-IIolberg basin is the Marble River. It has a drainage area of 512 km 2 and flows from Alice Lake en-tering Rupert Inlet near the junction with IIolberg and Quatsino Narrows. This dis-charge location presents a situation differ-ent from that of the typical inlet in which the freshwater enters near the head. Industrial, scientific, and public interest in Rupert and Holbcrg Inlets was gene-rated during 1970 with the application and subsequent <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>permit</b> to dis-charge wastes from a copper-molybdenum mine into the bottom of these inlets.

Mehringer of Washington State University, with <b>a</b> team <b>of</b> leading {{local and}} national authorities in Paleo-Indian Archaeology {{and members of the}} Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, discovered 22 more stone and bone tools, but removed only five for laboratory study. Richey, who in November 1988 bought out his partners and became sole owner of the Clovis site, replaced the Mehringer team with New York archaeologist R. Michael Gramly, who then led another dig in October 1990. This excavation became controversial, with members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation protesting the state governmentâ€™s <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archaeological <b>permit</b> for Gramly, whose statements and writings questioned a link between Clovis Paleo-Indians and modern Indians. Gramly had also argued against new laws that, in his view, tied the hands of U.S. archaeologists in favor of protecting Indian cultural heritage. In addition, the Tribes objected to the excavation of the site for personal profit (see below).|$|R

The original owner Frank Scott, an early independent casino pioneer in Las Vegas, named his company Dres Media Inc., and chose KRLR, which contained the first letter of each of his three children's names, for the station's call letters in December 1982. In August 1984, after <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> extensions to the original construction permit, the station applied for its license to cover construction and went on the air under a Program Test Authority. KRLR was an independent station branding itself as Vusic 21, and at first, aired only music videos.

40|$|Historically, {{protection}} and assistance to victims of human trafficking in many countries is anchored in migration law and dependent {{on whether or not}} <b>a</b> residence <b>permit</b> is granted to the victim. Apart from some limited exceptions, cooperation with law enforcement authorities in criminal investigations is a condition for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> residence <b>permit</b> to victims of trafficking. Given the fact that many victims are national victims (for instance in the Netherlands around 25 %) or {{in the context of the}} EU are EU citizens and do not need <b>a</b> residence <b>permit,</b> this link with migration law excludes them from the special programmes for trafficking victims. Moreover, many victims do not want to go to the police or do not consider themselves victims of trafficking or are unaware of the {{protection and}} assistance facilities available, which further limits the range of such programmes.

A modification was filed with the FCC to move the station to the WCXT tower north of Benton Harbor. This was rejected and the construction permit was canceled on August 5, 2008, by the FCC {{on the grounds that}} the new coverage area did not include the southern portion of the original coverage area which was <b>a</b> violation <b>of</b> the 307(b)preference they had received. Superior Communications filed a request for reconsideration with <b>a</b> waiver <b>of</b> the 73.2002(c) rules. The waiver stated it was impossible to duplicate the original coverage area since land was no longer available for a tower near the 1998 proposed site. Furthermore, it said the new location would cover 87% of the original population, add 30,000 to the total population served, and provide a first non-commercial radio service to over 2,000 people. The FCC granted the modified construction permit on November 13, 2008, and the station filed for a license on November 25, 2008.|$|R
