5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target <b>for</b> <b>Tonight</b> and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E

25|$|Hugh Malcolm Downs (born February 14, 1921) is {{a retired}} long-time American broadcaster, {{television}} host, news anchor, TV producer, author, game show host, and music composer. He is {{perhaps best known for}} his roles as co-host of the NBC News program Today from 1962–71, host of the Concentration game show from 1958–69, and anchor of the ABC News magazine 20/20 from 1978–99. He also served as announcer/sidekick <b>for</b> <b>Tonight</b> Starring Jack Paar, host of the PBS talk show Over Easy, and co-host of the syndicated talk show Not for Women Only.|$|E
25|$|The {{company that}} hired him <b>for</b> <b>Tonight</b> for Sure {{brought him back}} to re-cut a German film titled Mit Eva fing die Sünde an {{directed}} by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for The Bellboy and the Playgirls, also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), sound man for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other British {{propaganda}} films, Men of the Lightship was distributed in the United States. It was released in an edited version under the title Men of Lightship 61. Twentieth-Century Fox and RKO had been approached as possible distributors for the film in the U.S., but had both declined, suggesting that the film in its current state was unsuitable for an American audience. Alfred Hitchcock was subsequently approached to explore the possibility of adapting the narration, using an American narrator. As well as supervising the editing process, Hitchcock funded the project {{at a cost of}} $4,428. Robert Emmet Sherwood, who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1940 Hitchcock film Rebecca, was chosen to edit the script for the narration, which was spoken by actor Robert Montgomery. The modified version of the film was distributed by Twentieth-Century Fox in 1941. Hitchcock also later oversaw the editing of the film Target <b>for</b> <b>Tonight.</b> On both occasions, he was uncredited.|$|E

500|$|The first popular Allied war films {{made during}} the Second World War came from Britain and {{combined}} the functions of documentary and propaganda. Films such as The Lion Has Wings and Target <b>for</b> <b>Tonight</b> were made {{under the control of}} the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's In Which We Serve (1942) – [...] "the most successful British film of the war years", Millions Like Us (1943), and The Way Ahead (1944).|$|E
500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] is a dance-pop and synthpop {{song with}} electro rock and house influences. The song starts out with {{electronic}} church bells and Gaga softly singing [...] "I'm gonna marry the night/I won't {{give up on}} my life/I'm a warrior queen/Live passionately tonight." [...] Soon the beat changes into a dance one, accompanied with techno beats, handclaps and funk music, {{and moves to the}} chorus, where Gaga stutters the line [...] "Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry the night". It was compared by Tim Jonze from The Guardian to the Eurodance song, [...] "It's My Life" [...] by Dr Alban, while Nicola James from MTV compared the chorus with Jennifer Lopez's 1999 single [...] "Waiting <b>for</b> <b>Tonight.</b> In a pre-release review of certain album tracks, Peter Robinson from the NME blog wrote that Gaga channels [...] "Whitney Houston-esque pop euphoria" [...] into the song, notably that from the singer's musical peak.|$|E

On the label of the original 45 RPM single, the 3:14-long [...] "Fakin' It" [...] was printed with a run time of [...] "2:74" [...] to try to get past radio programmers who were still strict with the [...] "Under 3 minutes" [...] pop single formula. [...] "Fakin' It" [...] found only modest success on AM radio. [...] In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, Three <b>for</b> <b>Tonight,</b> performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Richard Avedon, regarded then {{as one of the best}} photographers, was commissioned to shoot the album cover. When viewed up close, one can see Avedon's reflection in Simon's irises.|$|E

500|$|In November 2005, Mostow and Smith {{committed}} to Tonight, He Comes, with production slated {{to begin in}} Los Angeles in summer 2006. [...] Smith's salary in his pay or play contract for the film was $20million and 20 percent of the film's gross. [...] The actor had also set up a pay or play contract to film I Am Legend under Warner Bros. after completion of Tonight, He Comes. Mostow eventually departed from the project due to creative differences. Italian director Gabriele Muccino filled Mostow's vacancy in May 2006. Since Muccino was busy editing The Pursuit of Happyness starring Smith, which Muccino had directed, Smith switched projects to film I Am Legend first for its December 2007 release, and then film Tonight, He Comes afterward. Later in the month, Muccino left the project because of an incompatibility with filming the story. Since Muccino was preparing The Pursuit of Happyness, the studio had delayed the production start <b>for</b> <b>Tonight,</b> He Comes to summer 2007, enabling Warner Bros. to begin production of I Am Legend with Smith.|$|E
500|$|Prior to release, {{the band}} helped put {{together}} and {{performed at the}} Monterey Pop Festival, which signaled {{the beginning of the}} Summer of Love on the West Coast. [...] "Fakin' It" [...] was issued as a single that summer and found only modest success on AM radio; the duo were much more focused on the rising FM format, which played album cuts and treated their music with respect. In January 1968, the duo appeared on a Kraft Music Hall special, Three <b>for</b> <b>Tonight,</b> performing ten songs largely culled from their third album. Bookends was released by Columbia Records in April 1968. In an historical context, this was just 24 hours before the assassination of Civil Rights Movement activist Martin Luther King, Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. The album debuted on the Billboard Top LPs in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart as a whole for 66 weeks. Bookends received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse, a fact it touted in magazine ads. The record became the duo's best-selling album to date: it fed off the buzz created by the release of The Graduate soundtrack album ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units.|$|E
2500|$|Alone in {{the cabin}} outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She {{considered}} her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years. [...] During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called [...] "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: [...] "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread <b>for</b> <b>tonight</b> & breakfast.... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags." [...] An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed [...] "in corduroy trousers, mining boots, and a torn soiled blouse .... a blue bandana tied around her head", {{and went on to}} say that [...] "her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue".|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun <b>for</b> <b>tonight.</b> Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
