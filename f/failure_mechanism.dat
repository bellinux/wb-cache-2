That means {{that for a}} 25V tantalum capacitor with a safety margin of 4 the dielectric voltage proof can withstand 100V {{to provide a more}} robust dielectric. This very high safety factor is substantiated by the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of solid tantalum capacitors, “field crystallization”.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} of failure at the 17th Street Canal, London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal (east side north) were improper {{design of the}} canal floodwalls. The <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the Industrial Canal (east side south and west side) was overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge. The primary mechanism of failure for levees protecting eastern New Orleans was the existence of sand in 10% of places instead of thick Louisiana clay. The primary mechanism of failure for the levees protecting St. Bernard Parish was overtopping due to negligent maintenance of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel, built and maintained by the Corps of Engineers.|$|E

2500|$|Asphalt (specifically, asphalt concrete), {{sometimes}} called flexible pavement {{due to the}} nature in which it distributes loads, has been widely used since the 1920s. The viscous nature of the bitumen binder allows asphalt concrete to sustain significant plastic deformation, although fatigue from repeated loading over time is the most common <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> [...] Most asphalt surfaces are laid on a gravel base, which is generally at least as thick as the asphalt layer, although some 'full depth' asphalt surfaces are laid directly on the native subgrade. [...] In areas with very soft or expansive subgrades such as clay or peat, thick gravel bases or stabilization of the subgrade with Portland cement or lime may be required. Polypropylene and polyester geosynthetics have also been used for this purpose and in some northern countries, a layer of polystyrene boards have been used to delay and minimize frost penetration into the subgrade.|$|E
2500|$|This {{may occur}} in compact {{fluorescent}} lamps with integral electrical ballasts or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard failure profile for any electronic device. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10nbsp&°C temperature rise. The quoted average {{life of a lamp}} is usually at [...] ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, so at this temperature, not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Similarly, running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{tests are}} {{designed}} to reproduce failures of a product which can occur in actual use. Understanding <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{from the results of}} reliability testing is extremely important to know the product is reliable in actual use. The effect of stresses (temperature, humidity, voltage, current etc.) on the occurrence of failures can be identified by understanding the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The product reliability in actual use can be predicted from the results of the reliability tests, which are conducted under accelerated conditions. Reliability-affecting problems of the product can also be identified by clarifying the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Such information is useful in improving the product design and manufacturing processes to enhance the product reliability and quality, as well as in determining precautions for use which must be made clear to the customers. Reliability testing also provides useful information for the manufacturer to screen products using an optimal method selected according to the identified <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Furthermore, {{in the event of a}} failure reported in the market, understanding of the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> enables the manufacturer to take prompt and proper measures for correcting the design and/or manufacturing processes, so that the recurrence of the failure can be prevented. This chapter introduces typical <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of semiconductor devices that can be encountered in actual use. 4. 1 Failure Classification Statistical methods and methods for treating failure from a physical standpoint are used to analyze semiconductor device reliability. This approach is called the physics of failure. Its objective is to make <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> clear by understanding the physical characteristics of failure down to the atomic and molecular levels.

40|$|The {{compressive}} {{performance of}} a filament-wound cylinder can be severely degraded by unavoidable fiber curvatures due {{to the presence of}} crossover bands. These crossover bands contain fiber undulations which influence the compressive strength, stiffness, and associated <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of a filament-wound structure. The primary objectives of this study were to identify <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and measure the compressive strength and stiffness of test specimens which model the microundulations. Compressive tests were conducted on flat-panel coupons which were developed to model the mechanics of large-scale fiber undulation regions in filament-wound composite cylinders. The primary effect of the undulation regions within a filament-wound structure is to initiate failure. Depending on the overall laminate configuration, the failure process includes various combinations of <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as delaminations, matrix splitting and/or fiber fracture. These <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are aggravated by the presence of large deformations caused by the reduction in local compressive stiffness and the introduction of complex material couplings due to the fiber undulation. Furthermore, the adjacent layers have been shown to strongly influence the compressive strength, stiffness, and associated <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by weakening or reinforcing the laminate...|$|R

40|$|Metallurgical coke samples {{across the}} tuyere level of an {{operating}} blast furnace were analysed using a fractographic approach {{to identify and}} quantify various coke <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Tuyere level cokes displayed different <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> compared to the feed coke, implying a strong influence of the blast furnace reaction environment on the modification of coke <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The conchoidal and brittle overload type failures were noted {{to have an effect}} on the propagation of transgranular and intergranular crack growth in the coke microstructure. Feed coke breakage behaviour was strongly influenced by existing fissures and conchoidal fracture, while the breakage of the deadman coke lumps was dominated by pore wall collapse through intergranular crack growth in combination with erosive wear. The porosity at the IMDC–RMDC interface in coke has been identified as a critical parameter contributing to coke failure at tuyere regions. This fractographic study demonstrates that the fracture faces show evidence of the varying <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms</b> presented in the preceding manuscripts (Part 1 and Part 2), in addition to the erosive wear resulting from the blast furnace exposure.

40|$|Fatigue damage {{progression}} in {{composite materials}} {{is governed by}} different <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> each of which contributes to the damage to a different extent. To assess the cumulative damage undergone by the material and to estimate the residual life, {{it is necessary to}} discriminate and characterize the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This necessitates an on-line technique which can be used to monitor and measure the damage progression as it occurs. Acoustic emission (AE), an on-line monitoring tool, is ideally suited for this purpose.
