30|$|A fatigue {{analysis}} method and procedure are established for analyzing fatigue damage in deepwater test strings subjected to wave action. The {{results show that}} the fatigue damage in the deepwater test string fluctuates with the water depth, and damage varies considerably with position. The damage in the sections adjacent to the splash zone and the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> are much greater. The fatigue damage in the deepwater test string tends to increase as the top tension decreases and with wave height. Moreover, the damage in the <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> areas is sensitive to the top tension, whereas the damage in the upper sections of the test string is sensitive to the wave height.|$|E
30|$|There are two {{locations}} {{at which the}} deepwater test system is most susceptible to fatigue: {{in the vicinity of}} the splash zone and the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint.</b> These locations should be given special attention in managing the fatigue life of the deepwater test string. The fatigue damage in the sections located at the top of the test string in the splash zone primarily results from wave loads and the platform heaving motion, whereas the sections adjacent to the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> are mainly influenced by the offset motion of the floating platform. When the rotational stiffness of the flex joints is lower than that of the riser joints, the bending deformation and the vibration amplitude of the riser and the test string at this position are more significant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Offset of a {{dynamically}} positioned {{drilling vessel}} from the setpoint location above the wellhead affects {{a number of}} operational parameters which influence {{the point at which}} a disconnect should be initiated. Factors establishing disconnect limits, among others, include bottom <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> angle, top riser angle, slip joint strokeout, riser t nsioner strokeout, and riser/moonpool contact. For each of these parameters, the vessel x,y positions at which the physical disconnect limit is reached are variable {{over the course of a}} drilling operation. Furthermore, in an emergency situation, the speed at which the vessel is moving and the time it takes for execution of the disconnect sequence bears directly on the point in time when the disconnect should be initiated. Conventionally the bottom <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> angle has been used as the determining disconnect parameter. With increasing water depth, either the surface slip joint strokeout or riser t nsioner strokeout will become the physical limit. Depending on a particular rig’s configuration, the existing weather conditions and/or drilling conditions, other equipment parameters may constitute the limiting factor.

30|$|Several {{measures}} are {{proposed to improve}} the operation safety of the deepwater test string.

40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of more oil and gas to meet the growing demand and replace the declining production, the {{offshore}} industry is pushed to invest, explore and drill new wells in deeper waters with harsh environments and with a possibility of HPHT wells and sour well flows. Drilling risers with strength and corrosion resistance capable of handling these extreme conditions are accordingly required. As the water depth increases, the length and weight of the riser might lead to problems in terms of; increased loadings on the handling equipment and tensioner system, as well as storage and transportation limitations. Today, the conventional riser material is steel. Steel is a strong and relatively cheap material. However, it is heavy and not very corrosion resistant. Hence, the industry has turned its focus to lighter alternative materials. Aluminum and titanium risers with their light weight, high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance are potential candidates to substitute the heavy steel risers. In order to assess aluminum and titanium as alternative materials in riser design and determine if they are suitable for operations in the harsh environment in the Norwegian Sea, simulation studies in OrcaFlex has been conducted. The environmental data used in the simulations are from the Aasta Hansteen gas field, {{in an area of}} the Norwegian Sea where the water depth is about 1200 m. The output from the simulation software are compared with the ISO standard 13624 to find the maximum <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> angles and von Mises stress. The results from the dynamic simulations show that wave height and drilling fluid density influences the effective tension, <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> angles and the von Mises stress. The applied top tension proves to have the biggest impact on the results, and should be closely considered during the design phase. Aluminum and titanium both proves to fulfill the given design parameters, and can potentially be an alternative to the conventional steel riser in drilling operations in the Norwegian Sea. However, long term properties such as fatigue and corrosion should be investigated to get the full understanding...|$|E
40|$|Top Tensioned Riser (TTR) and Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) {{are often}} used in a {{floating}} oil/gas production system deployed in deep water for oil transport. This study focuses on the improvements to the existing numerical code, known as CABLE 3 D, to allow for static and dynamic simulation of a TTR connected to a floating structure through a tensioner system or buoyancy can, and a SCR connected to a floating structure through a <b>flex</b> <b>joint.</b> A tensioner system usually consists of three to four cylindrical tensioners. Although the stiffness of individual tensioner {{is assumed to be}} linear, the resultant stiffness of a tensioner system may be nonlinear. The vertical friction at a riser guide is neglected assuming a roller is installed there. Near the water surface, a TTR is forced to move due to the motion of the upper deck of a floating structure as well as related riser guides. Using the up-dated CABLE 3 D, the dynamic simulation of TTRs will be made to reveal their motion, tension, and bending moment, which is important for the design. A <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> is approximated by a rotational spring with linear stiffness, which is used as a connection between a SCR and a floating structure or a connection between a TTR and the sea floor. The improved CABLE 3 D will be integrated into a numerical code, known as COUPLE, for the simulation of the dynamic interaction among the hull of a floating structure, such as SPAR or TLP, its mooring system and riser system under the impact of wind, current and waves.

30|$|As Fig.  10 a shows, {{the fatigue}} damage tends to {{decrease}} with increasing top tension in the riser and the test string, and the fatigue damage in sections adjacent to the <b>flex</b> <b>joints</b> is significant. Higher levels of top tension could decrease the lateral displacement of the test string and the rotation angle of the <b>flex</b> <b>joints,</b> which would reduce the vibration amplitude. Thus, greater top tension could reduce fatigue damage in the test string due to wave action. As Fig.  10 b shows, the fatigue damage tends to increase with wave height. The tendency in the upper sections of the test string is quite notable, {{a consequence of the}} flow velocity being an exponential function of the water depth. Furthermore, the platform motion caused by waves has a significant influence on the fatigue in the upper sections of the test string. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that applying greater top tension and operating in a favorable marine environment would markedly reduce fatigue damage in the test string.|$|R

30|$|The {{deepwater}} test string is {{an important}} but vulnerable component in offshore petroleum exploration, and its durability significantly affects the success of deepwater test operations. Considering the influence of random waves and {{the interaction between the}} test string and the riser, a time-domain nonlinear dynamic model of a deepwater test string is developed. The stress-time history of the test string is obtained to study vibration mechanisms and fatigue development in the test string. Several recommendations for reducing damage are proposed. The results indicate that the amplitude of dynamic response when the string is subjected to random loads gradually decreases along the test string, and that the von Mises stress is higher in the string sections {{near the top of the}} test string and the flex joints. In addition, the fatigue damage fluctuates with the water depth, and the maximum damage occurs in string sections adjacent to the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> and in the splash zone. Several measures are proposed to improve the operational safety of deepwater test strings: applying greater top tension, operating in a favorable marine environment, managing the order of the test string joints, and performing nondestructive testing of components at vulnerable positions.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe present work {{investigates the}} effect of the bending loads on the {{wellhead}} systems and predicts the response of the conductor with the introduction of CAN™ (Conductor Anchor Node) and Seabed BOP Supporter. Performance of the wellhead and conductor system is dependent on field design parameters. These parameters can include local environmental loading, drilling rig motions, marine riser stack-ups and BOP (Blow-out Preventer) configuration and soil conditions. These loads may cause severe damage to the wellhead system. In order to reduce {{the effect of}} these loads, the possibility of incorporating other components such as the CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter can be considered. The present work aims at introducing the mentioned CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system and assessing their influence on the bending moment response of the conductor. This has been analyzed considering different load cases outlined below. Load Case 1 : The analysis was carried out considering a conventional drilling mode with a 30 ” wellhead system, drilling riser and a BOP system. Load Case 2 : The analysis was performed considering Wellhead system with BOP and drilling riser supported in a CAN™ foundation developed by NeoDrill AS. Load Case 3 : The analysis also considers Seabed BOP Support in addition to the CAN™. The Seabed BOP Supporter is located in between CAN™ and BOP. The purpose of a Sea bed BOP supporter is to transfer pre-set part of BOP weight directly to CAN™ and to counteract riser induced BOP moments on Wellhead. 3 -D FE (Finite Element) model based on PIPE element was established for the mentioned three load cases. The analyses have been performed by considering various factors that include internal axial casing load, external load from BOP, drilling riser tension, foundation soil support stiffness, and the cement level within the annulus of the conductor and surface casing. The shear loads that occur when the well is configured for drilling operations are applied at the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> over a range from - 490 kN to + 490 kN. The results from the analysis are discussed against the two criteria established to assess the structural integrity of the wellhead conductor. These criteria are: allowable bending capacity of the conductor and limiting <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> rotation angles. The results show that the introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter influences the response for bending moment of Wellhead conductor considerably. The results further conclude that the reduction in the bending moment of the conductor is in the order of 25 % and 80 % due to introduction of CAN™ and Seabed BOP Supporter in the wellhead system, respectively...|$|E
40|$|An airtight, {{flexible}} joint is disclosed for the interfacing of two pressure vessels such as between the Space Station docking tunnel and the Space Shuttle Orbiter bulkhead adapter. The joint provides for flexibility while still retaining a structural {{link between the}} two vessels required due to the loading created by the internal/external pressure differential. The joint design provides for limiting the axial load carried across the joint to a specific value, a function returned in the Orbiter/Station tunnel interface. The <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> comprises a floating structural segment which is permanently attached {{to one of the}} pressure vessels through the use of an inflatable seal. The geometric configuration of the joint causes the tension between the vessels created by the internal gas pressure to compress the inflatable seal. The inflation pressure of the seal is kept at a value above the internal/external pressure differential of the vessels in order to maintain a controlled distance between the floating segment and pressure vessel. The inflatable seal consists of either a hollow torus-shaped flexible bladder or two rolling convoluted diaphragm seals which may be reinforced by a system of straps or fabric anchored to the hard structures. The joint acts as a flexible link to allow both angular motion and lateral displacement while it still contains the internal pressure and holds the axial tension between the vessels...|$|E

40|$|Suspension {{thermal noise}} {{has become a}} {{limitation}} in {{the resolution of the}} Advanced LIGO interferometer, hindering our ability to detect gravity waves at low frequency. The present baseline solution, fused silica fibers, has many inherent problems that are difficult to overcome. Oxidation presents the most significant problem, as it weakens the fiber and lowers the quality factor, severely limiting the theoretical advantages of using fused silica as suspension material. These problems were the incentive for researching amorphous metals as an alternative material for mirror suspensions. Amorphous MoRuB samples are currently being manufactured and tested for use as flex joints for mirror suspensions. Several material properties and sample characteristics have to be measured, in particular, it is necessary to certify each <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> uniform, compact, and free from cracks both before and after manufacturing. Certifying that each joint is free from cracks down to a level substantially smaller than the material’s catastrophic failure critical defect size (~ 100 mm for MoRuB) is equivalent to certifying that the sample will not crack unless it is exposed to stresses exceeding the material ultimate yield strength. Good joint certification allows us to fully use the material’s strength. This certification is made through X-ray imaging of the samples (in our case we used a diagnostic medical X-ray unit courtesy of the Animal Care facility at Caltech), digitizing the images using a scanner (in our case a slide scanner courtesy of Caltech’s Digital Media Center), and then analyzing the results. We developed a process that certifies a sample as being uniform (same thickness throughout and free of any holes/cracks) and therefore suitable for use as a flex-joint suspension. This certification process is also applied to all samples used to measure the material’s properties...|$|E
40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and riser pipe in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the riser pipe place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the riser pipe wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back. Solutions like redesign of the telescopic joint and blowout preventer is advised by operators, but some of the solution are proven to be economical unprofitable...|$|E
40|$|Well {{intervention}} operations can inflict large strains on a wellhead. The seabed in the North Sea is very rigid up to {{the point}} where the sea water meets the mud or sand. This is one of the reasons why wellheads operating on the Norwegian continental shelf are more exposed to fatigue damage. In search for more oil and the wish to increase the utilization rate of existing wells the oil companies drill more and more, causing more and more fatigue life consumption. The oil companies must provide sufficient documentation that the wellhead always has enough remaining fatigue life to perform a Plug and Abandon (P&A) operation. Full scale measurements has been collected for a marine drilling riser connected to a moored Aker H- 3 rig operating on a field with a depth of 325 m. The angles at the bottom of the riser above the lower marine riser package are used to calculate the consumed cumulative fatigue life using rainflow cycle counting and Miner-Palmgren summation. A simulation model has been developed in the computer simulation program RIFLEX, which is a state of the art simulation program developed especially for slender structures such as a riser in a marine environment. The model was built with relatively conservative assumptions. This resulted on fatigue life assessments that gave a shorter operation life than what was found using the full scale measurements. Using such simulation is often the only tool available to document fatigue life consumption since full scale measurement tools are rarely installed and used. It is vital that the simulation yield reliable and correct results and as close to the true result as possible. A series of similar simulation models were developed where we looked at the effect of taking away some of the conservatism in the original model. First we looked at the difference between a JONSWAP wave spectrum and a Torsethaugen wave spectrum. The difference lies in the assumption of that a sea state is a superposition of wind driven waves and swell waves, where the Torsethaugen use empirical data collected from the North Sea to account for the difference. A Torsethaugen is a double-peaked spectrum while the JONSWAP spectrum is a single-peaked spectrum. The difference between the two results gave little or no effect on the motion characteristics and fatigue life. Then we introduce a directional wave spectrum, meaning that waves may be short-crested and spread around a mean wave direction. This reduced the angular motion in terms of standard deviation significantly. The reduction was between 10 % - 15 %. It also affected the fatigue life positively. In the next model we introduced non-linear behaviour in the lower <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> while the waves now were unidirectional. In terms of standard deviation the reduction was the same as for the model with wave spreading. In the last comparison model we used both non-linear <b>flex</b> <b>joint</b> behaviour and wave spreading. The total reduction was again significant. For some of the simulation even up to 30 % compared to the original model. All the standard deviation from the full scale data has natural variances from data set to data set and most of the computer simulation fell within this margin of error. For all simulation models the model was tested with different mean heading direction of the waves. The mean heading directions were 0 deg, 30 deg, 60 deg and 90 deg relative to the rig. While the full scale measurement had little correlation between the measured response direction and the weather direction, the simulation were very consistent on this matter. Some simulations with current and support vessel offset was performed to find the effect on the standard deviation. While the presence of current damped the angular motion, the standard deviation increased with increasing support vessel offset. A discussion around the uncertainty of the true characteristics of the non-linear model explains some of the behaviour. When comparing fatigue life the calculated fatigue life consumption became closer and closer to the measured value as we removed the conservatism. However, by a closer investigation of the angle range spectra which is used in the Miner-Palmgren summation there was found differences that need more attention. While the angle range spectrum from the full scale measurement show a close to linear relation between numbers of cycles exceeding ranges the shape for the simulated models were far from linear. In terms of the shape parameter in the Weibull distribution it was found through fitting the curve that the shape model for full scale and RIFLEX simulations were around 1. 05 and 1. 9, respectively. It is this difference in shape that demands a closer investigation of the simulation models. The fact that the fatigue life approached the true fatigue life so closely should so far be regarded as a coincidence and not a result of good model approximations. It was also found that the full scale motion for some of the time series are low frequency dominated, i. e. high energy in oscillating components with a frequency outside the wave spectrum. Some peak periods reach periods over a minute or even two. This is an effect that is unaccounted for in the models presented in this thesis. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{oil and gas}} {{sources are}} found in deeper water depths and in more hostile environments. This results in {{the need for more}} advance technologies. Riser system is a key element in {{providing}} safety. Riser failure results in spillage or pollution and could endanger lives. Hence, it is important to establish a high degree of reliability for riser design. Steel catenary risers (SCRs) have been a preferred riser solution for deep-water field developments due to its simple engineering concept, cost effective, flexibility in using different host platform and flexibility in geographical and environmental conditions. Flexible riser, on the other hand, is limited by technical and economical reasons when it comes to deep water field. Larger diameter is required in deep water to increase collapse resistance due to high hydrostatic pressure. Consequently, increase in cost and limit the option of host platform. Alternatively, Hybrid riser is a robust design for deepwater and harsh environments. It is insensitive to motion induced fatigue. However, hybrid riser is considered to be an expensive solution because it comprises a number of complex components (buoyancy can, riser bundle, <b>flex</b> <b>joint,</b> etc). A number of SCRs have been installed worldwide over the past years and more to come in the future oil and gas explorations. However, there is no SCR that has been installed in deepwater with harsh environments to date. It is mainly because SCRs in harsh environments experience a great challenge due to large motions from host platform such as semi-submersibles and FPSOs. Therefore, significant design effort is required to prove that the SCRs could safely withstand environmental loads in harsh environments and the effects of deep water. The study investigates the feasibility of 10 inch production SCR for Offshore Norway in a 1000 m water depth with SCR attached to a semi-submersible vessel. Conventional SCR was analyzed and found difficulty in meeting strength design criteria at the touch down point (TDP) and at the riser hang off location. From previous industry work, the weight variation along the riser length has demonstrated a remarkable improvement to SCR response, particularly at TDP. This study concentrates on fundamental aspects related to improvement from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR. A number of insightful sensitivity analyses were performed {{in order to understand the}} correlation between the peak response and some fundamental parameters such as displacement, velocity and acceleration. Feasibility enhancement of present weight distributed SCR concept was also studied to provide more applicable SCR configuration solution. The study addresses global design considerations including analysis of strength and fatigue. Deepwater SCR Installation scheme was also discussed. The study concludes that there is significant improvement in SCR response from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR concept. It also proves that even though the design of SCR in harsh environments and deep water is technically challenging, innovative solutions can be developed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{in order to}} perform a drift off calculation for drillships according to given parameters such as: environmental conditions and water depth. Drift off occurs when there is insufficient thruster force so that the vessel is drifted away from the target position by the environmental forces. For a safe operational drillship {{it is expected that}} the drifting off will be resumed in due time when blackout recovery system starts running and, therefore, enough thrust takes place. Water depth plays an important role when considering the default maximum release of Lower <b>Flex</b> <b>Joint</b> (LFJ) angle for physically disconnecting, which is 10 degrees in the majority of suppliers. This methodology is intended to be applied to drillship design, by comparing the time to stop drifting and the distance from the reference point after a total blackout occurs. Electrical generators sets installed in drillships are designed to work with extreme environmental conditions. Since there is an excess of installed power {{for the majority of the}} operational time, drillships often operate with all high voltage busbars connected to each other improving engine efficiency, decreasing levels of pollution emissions and reducing maintenance. The use of this electrical power configuration is possible because there is no need to turn on all generators at the same time, but only the ones that are needed on that particular moment. However, when a single failure such as a short circuit occurs and the system is not prepared to disable and segregate the failure, all electrical system will crash, causing a total blackout and the drillship will start to drift off. The drifting off time was obtained by numerical simulations conducted by modeling a standard drillship using time domain software. The model took into consideration the vessel hydrodynamics under environmental conditions (wind, current and wave), the drag force in marine drilling riser, and the thrusters in Dynamic Positioning (DP) operation. The simulation is divided into three steps: First, the behavior of the DP system in full operation is simulated until system is stable. After that, all thrusters are turned off to simulate a total blackout. Finally, since the ship will not stop immediately because of its inertia, a time range for the ship’s inertia was also considered and this time is added to the pre-established blackout duration. The conclusion of the study shows how parameters as water depth, environmental conditions, and blackout recovery time affect the necessary time to stop drifting off, so as to foresee that after a total blackout the standard drillship will remain in safe limits.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore {{technology}} : subsea technologyNowadays, {{oil and gas}} {{sources are}} found in deeper water depths and in more hostile environments. This results in {{the need for more}} advance technologies. Riser system is a key element in providing safety. Riser failure results in spillage or pollution and could endanger lives. Hence, it is important to establish a high degree of reliability for riser design. Steel catenary risers (SCRs) have been a preferred riser solution for deep-water field developments due to its simple engineering concept, cost effective, flexibility in using different host platform and flexibility in geographical and environmental conditions. Flexible riser, on the other hand, is limited by technical and economical reasons when it comes to deep water field. Larger diameter is required in deep water to increase collapse resistance due to high hydrostatic pressure. Consequently, increase in cost and limit the option of host platform. Alternatively, Hybrid riser is a robust design for deepwater and harsh environments. It is insensitive to motion induced fatigue. However, hybrid riser is considered to be an expensive solution because it comprises a number of complex components (buoyancy can, riser bundle, <b>flex</b> <b>joint,</b> etc). A number of SCRs have been installed worldwide over the past years and more to come in the future oil and gas explorations. However, there is no SCR that has been installed in deepwater with harsh environments to date. It is mainly because SCRs in harsh environments experience a great challenge due to large motions from host platform such as semi-submersibles and FPSOs. Therefore, significant design effort is required to prove that the SCRs could safely withstand environmental loads in harsh environments and the effects of deep water. The study investigates the feasibility of 10 inch production SCR for Offshore Norway in a 1000 m water depth with SCR attached to a semi-submersible vessel. Conventional SCR was analyzed and found difficulty in meeting strength design criteria at the touch down point (TDP) and at the riser hang off location. From previous industry work, the weight variation along the riser length has demonstrated a remarkable improvement to SCR response, particularly at TDP. This study concentrates on fundamental aspects related to improvement from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR. A number of insightful sensitivity analyses were performed {{in order to understand the}} correlation between the peak response and some fundamental parameters such as displacement, velocity and acceleration. Feasibility enhancement of present weight distributed SCR concept was also studied to provide more applicable SCR configuration solution. The study addresses global design considerations including analysis of strength and fatigue. Deepwater SCR Installation scheme was also discussed. The study concludes that there is significant improvement in SCR response from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR concept. It also proves that even though the design of SCR in harsh environments and deep water is technically challenging, innovative solutions can be developed...|$|E
