No marvel, for it {{was their}} work, not to search the deep things of God, but those which be the things of a man, and to {{discourse}} of that righteousness, and principle of holiness, which was naturally founded, and found within themselves, as men; or, as you say, 'as creatures possessed with a mind and reason.' But as I have already shewed, all this may be, where the Holy Ghost and faith is absent, even by the dictates, as you call them, of human nature; a principle, and actions, when trusted to that, as much please the devil, as any wickedness that is committed by the sons of men. I should not have thus boldly inserted it, but that yourself did tell me of it (p. 101). But I believe it was only extorted from you; your judgment, and your Apollo, suit not here, though indeed the <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right; for this righteousness and holiness which is our own, and of ourselves, is the greatest enemy to Jesus Christ: the post against his post, and the wall against his wall. 'I came not to call the righteous [puts you quit of the world] but sinners to repentance.' ...|$|E

In this unlucky Moment another Servant, without Orders, went to the great Peer Sconce, and because, as he thought, he would be sure to snuff the Candle well, he offers to take it down, but very unhappily, I say, the Hook came out and down falls the Sconce Candle and all, and the Looking-Glass broke all to pieces, with a horrible Noise; however, the Candle falling out of the Sconce did not go out, but lay on the Floor burning dully, and as it is usual on such Cases, all on one Side, Betty cries out again, Law Madam, that Candle burns blue too; the very Moment she said this, the Footman that had thrown down the Sconce, says to his fellow Servant, that came to his Assistance, I think the <b>Devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Candles to Night, and away he run out of the Room, for fear of his Master.|$|E

50|$|A poor peasant and {{his wife}} did not even have a cow. They had a woodworker make them a calf of wood {{and brought it to}} the pasture. When the cowherd {{returned}} without it, they found it had been stolen and took him to court for his carelessness, and the judge made him give them a cow. They had nothing to feed it and so had to kill it. The peasant took the hide to town to sell. He found a raven with broken wings and wrapped it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hide. Weather grew bad and he took shelter in a mill, where the miller's wife gave him some bread and cheese. Then the parson arrived, and because her husband was away, he and the wife had a feast. Her husband returned, and the wife hid the parson and the food. The peasant pretended that the hide was a soothsayer and made the raven croak. He told the miller where the food was hidden, and after they had eaten, that <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parson's hiding place.

This paper is structured as follows. Section two discusses the implications of recently released HIV prevalence rates and provides more detail on the expected demographic impacts of the pandemic using available demographic projections. Section three reviews literature focusing on macroeconomic impacts. Section four formally analyzes implications for human capital accumulation. Section five presents the economy-wide modeling approach including critical assumptions and model scenarios. Section six discusses the major results. Section seven summarizes and section eight considers both reactive and preventive policy implications [...] . [The paper concludes that] the economic analysis and related policy implications provide strong support for adoption of both reactive and preventive policies. While the pandemic cannot be avoided, much {{can be done to}} reduce its harshness and duration. Some relatively broad policy options were also presented; however, as usual, <b>the</b> <b>devils</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> details. Moving beyond these general policy ideas (both reactive and preventive) to real policy initiatives will require careful thought particularly with respect to issues of implementation.

The music, including The <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Beats and The <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Details, underscores the movie's style, recalling Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange with musical motifs consistent with Wright's [...] "fairy tale theme" [...] of childhood innocence confronting the modern [...] "synthetic" [...] world. Several reviewers have commented that the movie has a hyper-stylized Kubrickian tone, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange. The [...] "Kubrick-esque" [...] style includes Isaacs' [...] "gleeful sadism... at times darkly comedic," [...] a whistling villain reminiscent of Alex DeLarge. Joe Wright's [...] "love of fairy tales and David Lynch movies" [...] was seen as blending A Clockwork Orange [...] and the work of the Brothers Grimm.|$|E
