500|$|After 1555, the Peace of Augsburg {{became the}} legitimating legal {{document}} governing the co-existence of the Lutheran and Catholic faiths in the German {{lands of the}} Holy Roman Empire, and it served to ameliorate many of the tensions between followers of the so-called Old Faith and the followers of Luther, but it had two fundamental flaws.
