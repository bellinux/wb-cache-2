40|$|Abstract Background The {{resistance}} of Ae. aegypti to insecticides is already widespread {{and continues to}} develop. It represents a serious problem for programmes aimed at the control and prevention of dengue in tropical countries. In the light of this problem measures to control Ae. aegypti are being orientated towards how best to use existing insecticides, notably by combining those that have different modes of action. Results In this study we evaluated the operational efficiency of a mixture composed of pyriproxyfen (an insect growth regulator) and spinosad (a biopesticide) against a population of Ae. aegypti from Martinique resistant to pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides. The first step consisted of evaluating the efficacy of pyriproxyfen and spinosad when used alone, or in combination, against Ae. aegypti larvae under simulated conditions. The {{results showed that the}} mixture of pyriproxyfen+spinosad remained active for at least 8 months, compared with 3 months for spinosad alone, and 5 months for pyriproxyfen alone. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> step <b>in</b> <b>containers</b> experiencing natural conditions, pyriproxyfen and spinosad, maintained the rate of adult emergence at 20 % for 3 weeks and 3. 5 months, respectively. Following the same criteria of evaluation, the mixture pyriproxyfen+spinosad remained effective for 4. 5 months, showing that the combination of the two larvicides with different modes of action acted to increase the residual activity of the treatment. Conclusion The mixture of pyriproxyfen and spinosad kills larvae and pupae giving it a broader range of action than either insecticide. This mixture could preserve the utility of both insecticides in public health programs. </p...|$|R

5000|$|SODIS may {{alternatively}} {{be implemented}} using plastic bags. SODIS bags {{have been found}} to yield as much as 74% higher treatment efficiencies than SODIS bottles, which may be because the bags are able to reach elevated temperatures that cause accelerated treatment. SODIS bags with a water layer of approximately 1 cm to 6 cm reach higher temperatures more easily than SODIS bottles, and treat Vibrio cholerae more effectively. [...] It is assumed this is because of the improved surface area to volume ratio in SODIS bags. In remote regions plastic bottles are not locally available and need to be shipped in from urban centers which may be expensive and inefficient since bottles cannot be packed very tightly. Bags can be packed more densely than bottles, and can be shipped at lower cost, representing an economically preferable alternative to SODIS bottles in remote communities. The disadvantages of using bags are that they can give the water a plastic smell, they are more difficult to handle when filled with water, and they typically require that the water be transferred to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>container</b> for drinking.|$|R
40|$|The Special Minister of State {{has asked}} Infrastructure Victoria to provide {{advice on the}} future {{capacity}} of Victoria’s commercial ports.

In particular, {{in line with the}} Minister’s request, we will focus our study on the timing of, need for, and location of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>container</b> port <b>in</b> Victoria. Commercial ports are large and long-lived pieces of infrastructure, often being used for over 100 years. They play <b>a</b> key role <b>in</b> anchoring supply chains as a gateway for the movement of goods in and out of Victoria. Commercial ports have significant economic, environmental and social impacts. Where they are located and how they operate are influential factors in determining whether these impacts are positive or negative, and how they are geographically distributed. Planning and constructing a new port requires a long lead time. A decision on its timing must be based on the best available evidence, and strike a balance between pre-empting inadequate future ports capacity and the prospect of unused capacity in the short and medium term. Many people are interested in how Victoria plans its future commercial port capacity, and we are interested in hearing people’s views. Your input will help us to build consensus on the key factors we need to consider in preparing our advice. What this paper is about This paper sets out Infrastructure Victoria’s scope and approach in preparing our advice on Victoria’s future commercial port capacity. It describes: • our proposed process for preparing our advice • key factors and drivers of change likely to affect further development at the Port of Melbourne, Bay West, and Hastings • the additional work we are likely to undertake to inform our advice. We want to provide this information early so that stakeholders and anyone interested can see how we intend to prepare our advice.
