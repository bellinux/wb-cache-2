5|$|Long-term {{follow up}} by specialists in <b>endocrinology</b> is {{generally}} needed {{for people with}} known hypopituitarism.

5|$|Ray Fletcher Farquharson MBE (4 August 1897 – 1 June 1965) was a Canadian doctor, {{university}} professor, {{and medical}} researcher. Born in Claude, Ontario, he attended and {{taught at the}} University of Toronto {{for most of his}} life, and was trained and employed at Toronto General Hospital. With co-researcher Arthur Squires, Farquharson was responsible for the discovery of the Farquharson phenomenon, an important principle of <b>endocrinology,</b> which is that administering external hormones suppresses the natural production of that hormone.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, <b>endocrinology,</b> and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} <b>endocrinology</b> (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E

The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the University of Virginia Health System, is highly ranked in <b>endocrinology</b> according to U.S.News & World Report. Virginia has a ratio of 127 primary care physicians per 10,000 residents, which is the 16th highest nationally. Virginia was one of five states to receive a perfect score in disaster preparedness according to a 2008 report by the Trust for America's Health, based on criteria such as detecting pathogens and distributing vaccines and medical supplies.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Pedro Beauchamp is {{the first}} Puerto Rican {{specialist}} certified by the American Reproductive <b>Endocrinology</b> and Infertility Board who in 1985 performed the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique in Puerto Rico. In 1982, Dr. Beauchamp was responsible and is credited with delivering the first triplets born by in-vitro fertilization in the United States and the first in-vitro baby born in Argentina. His work is known as GIFT (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer) and TET (Tubal Embryo Transfer). Dr. Beauchamp returned to Puerto Rico in 1985 and established his practice in reproductive <b>endocrinology</b> and infertility {{in the city of}} Bayamón. In 1986, he delivered the first child born from the in-vitro fertilization procedure in all of Puerto Rico at the Regional Hospital of Bayamón.|$|E

Elders received a D.Sc. degree from Bates College in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Pediatric <b>endocrinology</b> {{became a}} {{recognizable}} specialty in the 1950s, {{but did not}} reach board status in the U.S. until the late 1970s. Even 10 years later, as a cognitive, procedureless specialty dealing with mostly rare diseases, {{it was one of}} the smallest, lowest-paid, and more obscure of the medical specialities. Pediatric endocrinologists were the only physicians interested in the arcana of GH metabolism and children’s growth , but their previously academic arguments took on new practical significance with major financial implications.|$|E
25|$|Supplies of this “cadaver growth hormone” were limited, {{and only}} the most {{severely}} deficient children were treated. From 1963 to 1985 about 7700 children in the U.S. and 27,000 children worldwide were given GH extracted from human pituitary glands to treat severe GH deficiency. Physicians trained in the relatively new specialty of pediatric <b>endocrinology</b> provided most of this care, but in the late 1960s {{there were only a}} hundred of these physicians in a few dozen of the largest university medical centers around the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Vishniac's {{immediate}} {{family moved to}} Berlin because of anti-Semitism spurred by uprisings against the Bolsheviks. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and Wolf. In his free time, he studied Far Eastern Art at the University of Berlin. Vishniac researched <b>endocrinology</b> and optics, and did some photography (see right). In Berlin, he also initiated his public speaking career by joining the Salamander Club, at which he often gave lectures on naturalism.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{published}} in the Indian Journal of <b>Endocrinology</b> and Metabolism focused on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in different African populations using various criteria. Reports from Lagos, Nigeria, for instance, showed the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome as high as over 80% among diabetic patients. The current trend of rising metabolic syndrome in African populations is largely and generally attributed to “adoption of western lifestyle which is characterized by reduced physical activity, substitution of the traditional African diet rich in fruits, and vegetables for the more energy-laden foods”.|$|E
25|$|The International Diabetes Federation and the American College of <b>Endocrinology</b> {{recommend}} HbA1c values below 48mmol/mol (6.5 DCCT %), {{while the}} American Diabetes Association recommends HbA1c be below 53mmol/mol (7.0 DCCT %) for most patients. Recent results from large trials {{suggest that a}} target below 53mmol/mol (7 DCCT %) for older adults with type 2 diabetes may be excessive: Below 53mmol/mol (7 DCCT %) {{the health benefits of}} reduced A1C become smaller, and the intensive glycemic control required to reach this level leads to an increased rate of dangerous hypoglycemic episodes.|$|E
