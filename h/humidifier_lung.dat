50|$|Overuse of a {{humidifier}} {{can raise}} the relative humidity to excessive levels, promoting the growth of dust mites and mold, and can also cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (<b>humidifier</b> <b>lung).</b> A relative humidity of 30% to 50% is recommended for most homes. A properly installed and located hygrostat {{should be used to}} monitor and control humidity levels automatically, or a well-informed and conscientious human operator must constantly check for correct humidity levels.|$|E
40|$|Background: Nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} {{are well}} {{known to be a}} cause of hot tub lung, however, to our knowledge, there exists no case report of <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> induced by mycobacteria. Case presentation: A case of a nonimmunocompromised female patient with Mycobacterium gordonae-induced <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> is described. She spontaneously recovered after discontinuing ultrasonic humidifier use. When subjected to a provocation test, she demonstrated acute respiratory distress with signs and symptoms, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Before and after the provocation test, water in the humidifier reservoir revealed only Mycobacterium gordonae by the microbiologic analyses. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> induced by nontuberculous mycobacteria. Although nontuberculous mycobacteria are well-known to be agents of hot tub lung or metal working fluid lung, physicians should also consider the pathogen as a cause of hypersensitivity lung reaction associated with humidifier use...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRecently, an {{increasing}} number of patients were presented to our clinics with febrile and respiratory symptoms associated with exposure to a new type of domestic ultrasonic humidifier. We report on 11 patients who developed recurrent episodes of fever, cough and dyspnea after repeated exposure to ultrasonic misting fountains at home. A diagnosis of extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) or toxic alveolitis was {{made on the basis of}} the history and the clinical, radiological, laboratory and immunological findings. Eight patients were subjected to inhalative challenge tests with their own ultrasonic misting fountains, and all of them exhibited positive reactions. Nine patients were diagnosed with an EAA (<b>humidifier</b> <b>lung)</b> and two patients with a toxic alveolitis (humidifier fever). This study demonstrates the potential for ultrasonic misting fountains to cause illness in the home. In view of the increasing popularity of these devices, <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> and humidifier fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained pulmonary or flu-like illnesses with fever...|$|E
40|$|Children {{who were}} only {{exposed to a}} mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT) as {{humidifier}} disinfectant (HD) components were evaluated for <b>humidifier</b> disinfectant-associated <b>lung</b> injury (HDLI) from 2012. This study was to evaluate the pulmonary function using, impulse oscillometry (IOS) for children exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT from HD. Twenty-four children who were only exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT, with no previous underlying disease, were assessed by IOS. Diagnostic criteria for HDLI were categorized as definite, probable, possible, or unlikely. Home visits and administration of a standardized questionnaire were arranged to assess exposure characteristics. Definite and probable cases showed higher airborne disinfectant exposure intensity during sleep (32. 4 ± 8. 7 μg/m 3) and younger age at initial exposure (3. 5 ± 3. 3 months) compared with unlikely cases (17. 3 ± 11. 0 μg/m 3, p = 0. 026; 22. 5 ± 26. 2 months, p = 0. 039, respectively). Reactance at 5 Hz was significantly more negative in those with high-density exposure during sleep (mean, - 0. 463 kPa/L/s vs. low density, - 0. 296, p = 0. 001). The reactance area was also higher with high-density exposure during sleep (mean, 3. 240 kPa/L vs. low density, 1. 922, p = 0. 039). The mean bronchodilator response with high-density exposure was within the normal range for reactance. Significant peripheral airway dysfunction were found in children {{with high levels of}} inhalation exposure to a mixture of CMIT/MIT during sleep. Strict regulation of a mixture of CMIT/MIT exposure were associated with positive effects on lung function of children...|$|R
40|$|In South Korea, {{a cluster}} of acute lung disease {{patients}} included lung injury disease suspected of being caused {{by the use of}} humidifier disinfectants. We examined the relationship between humidifier disinfectant exposure and clinically diagnosed <b>humidifier</b> disinfectant-associated <b>lung</b> injury (HDLI) in a family-based study. This case-control study included 169 clinically confirmed HDLI cases and 303 family controls who lived with the HDLI patients. A range of information on exposure to humidifier disinfectants was obtained using a structured questionnaire and field investigations. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, presence of a factory within 1 km of residence, and the number of household chemical products used. HDLI risk increased approximately two-fold or more among the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile in terms of the hours sleeping in a room with an operating humidifier treated with disinfectant (adjusted OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 3. 7), average hours of disinfectant-treated humidifier use per day (adjusted OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 4. 5), airborne disinfectant intensity (adjusted OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 5. 3), and cumulative disinfectant inhalation level (adjusted OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 4. 1). HDLI risk increased as the distance of the bed from humidifier gets shorter; compared with longer distance (> 1 m), the odds ratio was 2. 7 for 0. 5 to 1 m (95 % CI = 1. 5 - 5. 1) and 13. 2 for < 0. 5 m (95 % CI = 2. 4 - 73. 0). The use of household humidifier disinfectants was associated with HDLI risk in a dose-response manner...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical and sociomedical outcome {{in patients with}} various clinical manifestations of humidifier disease and work related asthma after removal from further exposure. METHODS: Follow up investigation (range 1 - 13 years) of respiratory symptoms, spirometry, airway responsiveness, sickness absence, and working situation in patients with (I) humidifier fever (n = 12), (II) obstructive type of <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> (n = 8), (III) restrictive type of <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> (n = 4), and (IV) work related asthma (n = 22). All patients were working at departments in synthetic fibre plants with microbiological exposure from contaminated humidification systems or exposure to small particles (< 1 micron) of oil mist. RESULTS: At follow up patients with work related asthma were less often symptom free (37 %, 7 / 19) than patients with humidifier disease (I, II, III) (67 %, 16 / 24). Mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of patients with obstructive impairment had been increased significantly at follow up but still remained below the predicted value. Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of patients with initially restrictive impairment had returned to normal values at follow up. Airway hyperresponsiveness at diagnosis persisted in patients with obstructive impairment (II + IV 14 / 17, but disappeared in patients with humidifier fever (3 / 3) and restrictive type of <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> (2 / 2). In patients with obstructive impairment (II + IV), FVC and FEV 1 at diagnosis were negatively associated with the duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis {{and the number of}} years of exposure. Those with positive pre-employment history of respiratory disease had a lower FEV 1 at diagnosis. Sickness absence due to respiratory symptoms decreased in all groups of patients after removal from further exposure, but this was most impressive in patients with the <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung</b> (II, III) and patients with work related asthma (IV). At follow up 83 % of the patients were still at work at the same production site, whereas 11 % received a disability pension because of respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with work related respiratory disease caused by exposure from contaminated humidification systems or oil mist, removal from further exposure resulted in clinical improvement, although, especially in those with obstructive impairment, signs persisted. Because of the possibility of transferring patients to exposure-free departments most patients could be kept at work...|$|E

40|$|Air-borne microorganisms, as well {{as their}} {{fragments}} and components, are increasingly recognized to be associated with pulmonary diseases, e. g. organic dust toxic syndrome, <b>humidifier</b> <b>lung,</b> building-related illness, "Monday sickness. " We have previously described and validated a new method for the detection of pyrogenic (fever-inducing) microbial contaminations in injectable drugs, based on the inflammatory reaction of human blood to pyrogens. We have now adapted this test to evaluate the total inflammatory capacity of air samples. Air was drawn onto PTFE membrane filters, which were incubated with human whole blood from healthy volunteers inside the collection device. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The test detects endotoxins and non-endotoxins, such as fungal spores, Gram-positive bacteria and their lipoteichoic acid moiety and pyrogenic dust particles with high sensitivity, thus reflecting the total inflammatory capacity of a sample. When air from different surroundings such as working environments and animal housing was assayed, the method yielded reproducible data which correlated with other parameters of microbial burden tested. We further developed a standard material for quantification and showed that this assay can be performed with cryopreserved {{as well as}} fresh blood. The method offers a test to measure the integral inflammatory capacity of air-borne microbial contaminations relevant to humans. It could thus be employed to assess air quality in different living and work environments. JRC. I. 2 -Validation of biomedical testing method...|$|E
