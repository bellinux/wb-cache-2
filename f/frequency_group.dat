40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the relationship among frequency of going-out, distance traveled, social interaction, and Health-Related QOL in elderly women. METHODS: The subjects were 260 elderly women aged 65 and older. They participated in community care programs aimed at prevention {{of the decline of}} ADL functions. Self-administered questionnaires included items about (1) The frequency of going-out and distance traveled, (2) Index of Social Interaction (ISI) composed of five categories; independence, social curiosity, interaction, feeling of safety, participation in the society, and (3) Short Form- 36 (SF- 36). RESULTS: First, the ISI scores of the high <b>frequency</b> going-out <b>group</b> were significantly higher than the low <b>frequency</b> <b>group's</b> in three categories; independence, interaction, participation in the society. The ISI scores of the wide distance traveled group were significantly higher than the narrow distance traveled group's in three categories; independence, social curiosity, participation in the society. Secondly, the SF- 36 total scores of the high <b>frequency</b> going-out <b>group</b> were significantly higher than the low <b>frequency</b> <b>group's</b> in two categories; physical functioning, general health perceptions. The SF- 36 scores of wide distance traveled group were significantly higher than the narrow scope group's in one category; physical functioning. Thirdly, participants who were interested in social relationship got high scores in both categories; "physical functioning" and "general health perceptions" in SF- 36.

Methods: We identified three subgroups of patients under treatment for 24 months with subcutaneous (sc) high-frequency IFNB- 1 a or - 1 b: those continuing to receive IFNB according to the drug label (recommended <b>frequency</b> <b>group),</b> those reducing the administration frequency of sc IFNB- 1 a or - 1 b (reduced <b>frequency</b> <b>group),</b> and those switched to once weekly intramuscular (im) IFNB (switched group). All patients were followed for further 24 months. The occurrence of relapse, MRI activity and disability worsening were considered as outcome measures. Results: We identified 308 patients, 201 in the recommended <b>frequency</b> <b>group,</b> 70 in the reduced <b>frequency</b> <b>group,</b> and 37 in the switched group. Patients in the reduced <b>frequency</b> <b>group</b> had increased risk for relapses (HR = 1. 95, p < 0. 001) and MRI activity (HR = 1. 41, p < 0. 001), while patients in the switched group had increased risk for relapses (HR = 1. 67, p = 0. 012), but not for MRI activity (HR = 1. 26, p = 0. 08) than those in the recommended <b>frequency</b> <b>group.</b> Predictors for disease activity re-start after the reduction of IFNB administration frequency were younger age, higher pre-IFNB relapse rate, and reducing sc IFNB frequency to twice weekly rather than switching to im IFNB- 1 a once weekly. Conclusion: Our findings discourage the reduction of sc IFNB administration frequency, especially in younger patients with a higher pre-IFNB relapse rate.

With this research, it was classified into the high <b>frequency</b> participation <b>group,</b> the low <b>frequency</b> participation <b>group,</b> and the nonparticipation group according to the frequency of sports. As a result, the difference was not shown at the women’s age, occupation and child’s age in sports participation. Moreover, especially as for the distinction, gender role orientation was not seen with sports participation, either, but a gender role orientation was a sense of values equal, regardless of sports participation or non-sports participation. Regarding the time factor, there was a difference with work-time, housekeeping, and child-caring which is significant between the high <b>frequency</b> participation <b>group,</b> the low <b>frequency</b> participation <b>group</b> and the non-participation group.
