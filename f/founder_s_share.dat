40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies {{analyzing}} the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Most have relied on either time series or cross-section data. The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> declined 17. 9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> would have declined only 13. 9 percent. Thus, the decline in unionization explains about 29 percent of the decline in labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. This paper is important for three reasons. First, this paper sheds light on whether social and institutional forces play an important role in determining the distribution of income between labor and capital. Second, it helps to explain recent increases in wage inequality. Third, it has implications for understanding the potential impact of legislation, such as the Employee Free Choice Act, that would make it easier for workers in the U. S. to unionize...|$|R

40|$|Early time-series {{studies that}} {{examined}} {{the impact of}} unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income were primarily descriptive. They generally found that unions did not impact labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. In contrast, later studies, using either panel data or cross-section data, have produced mixed results. This study adds {{to our understanding of}} this topic by first developing an analytical model based on imperfect competition and then testing the model using time-series data for the US manufacturing sector from 1949 - 2006. The results demonstrate that unions {{have a positive impact on}} labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income.

Using data {{at the level of}} detailed industries, this paper analyzes the decline in U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> against the backdrop of alternative measures of the competitiveness of the U.

S. export industries and not the size of U. S. sales within those industries, (iii) in a gravity framework, the majority of the decline in the U. <b>S.</b> export <b>share</b> within industries was due to the declining U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> of world income, and (iv) in a computed structural measure of firm productivity, average U.

In Chinese traditional custom,family property is equally inherited by all sons, and family property, secret recipe and consummate skills developed by ancestors are passed to male rather than female offspring, or otherwise to the spouse(s) of male offspring but never to the spouse(s) of female offspring. This study yields clues to understanding Japanese idea of “family”and“family business”, revealing cultural differences in family businesses between Japan and China. Furthermore, it provides enlightenment for Chinese entrepreneurs to avoid the path that “from clogs to clogs is only three generations”. 日本住友家業源于婿養子從生父家帶到妻家,此后十七代都以男性單子傳承為主軸,其間有過養子、婿養子繼承. 本文的基本觀點是,住友家的這一繼承模式是日本家業傳承的典型模式,與中國傳統的'諸子均分'以及家產、秘方、絕技'傳兒不傳女'、'傳媳不傳婿'的社會風俗,形成鮮明的對照. 作者系統梳理住友家業歷代的傳承情況,旨在從中探尋日本人的家業理念,以此為研究中日文化的同人提供一個反觀中日家族企業文化差異的新視角. 同時,對中國家業走出'富不過三代',改變傳統的繼承觀念與習俗也許有新的啟迪...|$|R
