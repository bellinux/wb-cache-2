For a time, {{he was a member}} of the London Society of Psychical Research. So interested was he in occultism that he even met Aleister Crowley in 1922, an event that Sorabji found disappointing and caused him to describe Crowley as [...] "the dullest of dull dogs". His occult interests also led to his friendship with Bernard Bromage (1899–1957), an English writer on mysticism and a member of the secret order of the Fraternity of Inner Light. Bromage was one of Sorabji's closest friends for 20 years, acting as <b>joint</b> <b>trustee</b> of the Shapurji Sorabji Trust between 1933 and 1941 and producing an index to Sorabji's book Around Music. Their relationship ended abruptly in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{information}} about the early life of Edmund Rice in England can be gleaned from his children's baptismal records and land ownership and other public records in Stanstead, Suffolk and [...] Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. [...] He moved from Stanstead to Berkhamsted sometime in 1626, based upon the baptismal dates of his children Thomas and Lydia. [...] That same year as a newcomer in town, Rice was named as a <b>joint</b> <b>trustee</b> along with Rev. Thomas Newman of a £50 grant {{for the benefit of}} the poor from King Charles I given on the occasion of his coronation. Under the incumbency of Rev. Newman, Rice served as a churchwarden at St. Peter's Church and acted as overseer of the poor for eight years. As a result of a royal inquisition held on 1 April 1634, funds remaining in the custody of Rice and Newman were to be transferred to the bailiff and burgesses of Berkhamsted as part of an effort to transfer and consolidate several royal charity grants for administration under civil authority. [...] While living in Berkhamsted, Rice acquired and was taxed on [...] of land in 1627, and on [...] from 1633 to 1637. [...] There is no record in Berkhamsted of Rice paying taxes on his land in 1638, possibly due to its sale to finance his trip to America.|$|E

50|$|The Irish Christian Brothers {{arrived in}} Armagh in 1851 at the {{invitation}} of Archbishop Cullen, who was later to be Ireland's first Cardinal. Within a few years the Christian Brothers acquired the Greenpark site and primary and secondary schools were established.

50|$|Pasley {{arrived at}} Melbourne on 18 September 1853, having been {{appointed}} {{in the spring}} of that year Colonial Engineer to the colony of Victoria. He found himself {{at the head of a}} considerable department, to which that of Colonial Architect was very soon added, and subsequently that of Central Road Board. In 1854 he was member of a commission to make arrangements for an exhibition of colonial products at the Paris Exhibition in the following year. In October 1854 he was nominated to a seat on the Victorian Legislative Council. About this time the Ballarat riots broke out, and he offered his services to the Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, and was sent to the goldfields on a special mission. In 1855 the new constitution came into force in Victoria, and the first responsible ministry was formed by William Haines in November 1855, General Pasley taking the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works. On 10 December he was appointed a member of the Executive Council, and a few months later was made by an Act of Council a <b>joint</b> <b>trustee</b> with Captain (later Lieut.-General Sir) Andrew Clarke, R.E., for the Melbourne and Mount Alexander Railway, purchased by Government. In 1856 Captain Pasley was elected to the first Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Bourke, and in March 1857 he resigned with the rest of the Ministry, but ultimately consented to remain as professional head of the Department of Public Works.|$|E

Mr Tanner has, I understand, some objection also; but I do not profess to understand its nature: he will no doubt speak for himself. But we are agreed that we can decide nothing until we know your views. I am afraid I shall have to ask you to choose between my sole guardianship and that of Mr Tanner; for I fear it is impossible for us to undertake a joint arrangement.|$|R
5|$|The Principal acts as {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of the university under the authority of the Board and the Senate, and supervises and directs the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. Since 1974, principals have been appointed for five-year terms, renewable subject to review. The formal authority for the appointment of the Principal rests under the Royal Charter with the Board of Trustees although recent principals have been selected by a <b>joint</b> committee of <b>trustees</b> and senators. Daniel Woolf has served as the twentieth principal, serving since 1 September 2009. The office of the vice-chancellor has typically been held by the incumbent principal. In 1961, an amendment was secured by the Board to separate the office of principal from vice-chancellor if it wished. The first, and only person to ever hold the office of vice-chancellor, but not the office of principal, was William Archibald Mackintosh.|$|R

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the Canadian pension {{regulatory}} environment and specifically Ontario. It proposes that unrelated employers be permitted to amalgamate their pension plans into a single plan using a multiple-employer structure, provided {{that all of the}} members of the single plan are represented by a union and the union has consented to the arrangement. It provides recommendations on how plans adopting this multiple-employer structure should operate in order to ensure that risks are appropriately allocated among stakeholders and that that there is strong governance. The pension formula would be defined benefit. The basic structure of the plan would be that the participating employers are required to contribute at a negotiated cents-per-hour rate based on the hours worked by covered employees. This would be the only financial obligation of the participating employers. The legal Administrator of the plan would be a <b>joint</b> board of <b>trustees.</b> There are a number of problems with the way in which Canadian multi-employer pension plans that are jointly trusteed and that are of the defined contribution – defined benefit type operate, especially with respect to governance. This paper makes a number of recommendations to improve plan governance, including only selecting independent experts to act as trustees and the compensation of trustees. In order to ensure the security of member benefits, the benefit formula would specify an ultimate benefit. With respect to the ultimate benefit, very conservative investment strategies would be employed and the benefit would be funded on a risk-free basis. Excess benefits would be provided to the extent that plan performance permitted. These excess benefits could be adjusted upward or downward depending on plan performance. This pension design would not be permitted in the current Ontario and Canadian regulatory environment. This report identifies a number of legislative and regulatory changes that would be required. The recommended plan is assessed using the measurement framework developed as part of the Retirement 20 / 20 project. The recommended approach scores very highly with respect to how risks are allocated. It also scores highly on governance. <br/...|$|R
