[...] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: [...] "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a [...] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests." [...] "I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it."

[...] "He {{was one of}} the best I’d ever seen," [...] Willie Davis, a defensive end who played for the Browns shortly after Lavelli retired, said. [...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

[...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E

[...] My life preserver came off and while I was floundering in the water, another hatch cover came up. [...] I grabbed the ring and pulled myself up on it. [...] I saw a foot sticking up from beneath it, and pulling it, {{found it to be}} Thomas McKernan, the son of the chief engineer. [...] I pulled him up and he revived after a while. [...] The lake was covered with wreckage and all around in the fog could be heard cries of [...] "Help" [...] but it was three quarters of an hour before the yawls of the Scott had been loosened and put in the water.|$|E
2500|$|During {{production}} on Kingdom of the Sun, Andreas Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated supermodeling poses published in magazines {{in order to}} capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona. Nik Ranieri was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma's rocky sidekick, Hucua. During the research trip to Peru in 1996, Ranieri acknowledged that [...] "I was researching for a character {{that looked like a}} rock so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> drawing rocks for the whole trip. Then when we got back they piled it into this story about ancient Incas." [...] Mark Pudleiner was to be the supervising animator of Kuzco's proposed maiden, Nina. In early 1997, David Pruiksma came on board to animate the llama, Snowball. According to Pruiksma, Snowball was [...] "a silly, vain and egotistical character, rather the dumb blond of the llama set. I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well. Before I left the film (and it was ultimately shelved), I created model sheets for not only Snowball, {{but for the rest of}} the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama." [...] When the film was placed on production shutdown, Pruiksma transferred to work on [...] being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{included mass}} protests and a prolonged non-payment campaign, and continued {{as long as}} did the tolls. [...] A toll-collector interviewed by the BBC said that abuse of collectors by motorists had been commonplace. Numerous toll opponents were cited for refusing to pay the toll, with around 500 being arrested and 130 subsequently convicted of non-payment. Among those charged was Clodagh Mackenzie, an elderly lady from whom the land necessary for the bridge's arrival in Skye had been compulsorily purchased; the charges against her were subsequently dropped without explanation. [...] Of those convicted, only the first, the SKAT Secretary Andy Anderson, received a (brief) prison term. [...] Those charged with non-payment {{had to make the}} 140 mile round trip to Dingwall sheriff court, again crossing the bridge and where again many refused to pay, incurring a further criminal charge. [...] Robbie the Pict argued that the legal paperwork for the tolls was incomplete, and that consequently the tolls themselves were illegal. [...] In particular he said that the [...] "assignation statement", a licence to charge a toll, had never been given. [...] Interviewed later by the BBC Fiscal Davind Hingston in Dingwall denied this claim, but admitted that he himself had been denied access to many government documents on the case, on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Hingston told the BBC [...] "As a fiscal <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>stuck</b> with that evidence but as a private individual I found it stunning", leading to renewed calls that the convictions of the toll protesters should be quashed - to this the Crown Office reiterated that appeals on these grounds had already been rejected by the courts.|$|E

3000|$|Juicy’s {{mother never}} {{expected}} {{this kind of}} confrontation and may have felt hurt and betrayed, since ‘all she wanted was to help’. However, the confrontation initiated by Juicy may have prevented the family from living with tensions and conflicts in the future. This matches the more individualistic understanding of intimacy among the Western spouses, who sometimes were less aware and accommodating of filial piety and its practical consequences for everyday family life. Even for Juicy, {{it was very difficult}} to initiate the confrontation with her mother, and she felt that it would take a long time to restore their relationship. Juicy quoted a comment by her husband Adam: ‘he said that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of those persons who <b>are</b> <b>stuck</b> in between Chinese and Westerner. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not very Chinese, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not very Western, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>stuck</b> in between’.

[...] Moretz has said that while filming, she could not bring herself to say the films title out loud in interviews, instead calling it [...] "the film" [...] in public and [...] "Kick-Butt" [...] at home.
