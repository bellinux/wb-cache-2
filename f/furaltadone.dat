2500|$|Residues {{from the}} {{breakdown}} of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, {{have been found in}} chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited <b>furaltadone</b> since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a [...] "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, <b>furaltadone</b> and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNitrofuran {{antibiotic}} residues in food {{continue to}} be of international concern. The finding of sources of semicarbazide (SEM), other than through the misuse of nitrofurazone, present {{a challenge to the}} use of SEM as a definitive marker residue for this drug. Detection of intact (parent) nitrofurazone would avoid confusion over the source of SEM residues. Broiler chickens were fed sub-therapeutic nitrofuran-containing diets and tissues analysed for parent compounds and metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Depletion half-lives in muscle were longer for tissue-bound metabolite residues, 3. 4 d (AOZ, AMOZ) to 4. 5 d (SEM), than total metabolite residues, 2. 0 d (AOZ) to 3. 2 d (SEM). Metabolite concentrations were higher in eyes than muscle. Metabolite half-lives in eyes ranged from 8. 5 d (AHD) to 20. 3 d (SEM). Nitrofuran parent compounds were also detected in eyes [...] <b>Furaltadone</b> was detected in single eyes after 21 d withdrawal of a 6 mg kg- 1 <b>furaltadone</b> diet. When 50 eyes from broilers containing metabolites in muscle close to the 1 µg kg- 1 MRPL were pooled into single samples, 1. 2 ng furazolidone and 31. 1 ng of <b>furaltadone</b> were detected, but nitrofurazone was not detected due to the long depletion half-life of SEM in muscle. Further studies are required to improve LC-MS/MS nitrofurazone sensitivity and refine the sample size necessary to use nitrofurazone detection in pooled eyes as a complement to SEM detection in muscle...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{nitrofuran}} antibiotics {{have been}} banned for use in food producing animals in many countries including European Union, because of the threat they pose to human health. Research continues into the accumulation of these drugs in animal tissues and into the appropriate methods for their detection. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method is presented {{for the detection of}} the parent compounds, furazolidone, nitrofurantoin, <b>furaltadone</b> and nitrofurazone in eggs. The parent compounds are first extracted into ethyl acetate, fats are removed by partition between acetonitrile and hexane, and the concentrated sample is analysed by LC-MS/MS. Decision limits (CCa) for the parents were £ 1 mg kg- 1 for all four compounds. Within-day and between-day CVs are well within the limits stated in Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. The method provides an alternative to the testing of side-chain metabolites in eggs, which is particularly important in the case of nitrofurazone, where semicarbazide contamination of food has been attributed to sources other than nitrofurazone use. This method was used together with a method for the detection of the side-chain metabolite compounds, AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM, to study the accumulation and distribution of the nitrofurans in eggs. Eggs were collected from 4 groups of hens that had been treated with one of the nitrofurans at a feed concentration of 300 mg kg- 1 for 1 week. Parent compounds and metabolites were found in the yolk, albumen and shell. The albumen/yolk ratios for the parent compounds were 0. 7, 0. 82, 0. 83 and 0. 31 for furazolidone, <b>furaltadone,</b> nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone, respectively. Ratios for the side-chain metabolites were 1. 02, 1. 06, 0. 83 and 0. 55 for AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM, respectively. However, 50 % of the total SEM residues were found in eggshell. This may be significant if eggshell products reach the consumer...|$|E
40|$|The global {{problem of}} food {{products}} contaminated by residues of the banned carcinogenic nitrofuran drugs has prompted research into how such residues accumulate in tissues. In the study described here, two aspects {{have been investigated}} where the nitrofurans accumulate in tissues from chickens exposed to either a dietary or an environmental source of contamination. Twenty groups of broilers were fed a diet containing one of the nitrofurans: furazolidone, nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin or <b>furaltadone</b> at concentrations of 30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 ?µg?kg- 1. At the lowest concentration of furazolidone contamination (0. 01 % of the therapeutic dose) tissue bound AOZ metabolite residues were detected in liver (1. 1 ?±? 0. 2 ?µg?kg- 1) and in muscle (0. 33 ?±? 0. 03 ?µg?kg- 1). Similar results were obtained for AMOZ (0. 6 ?±? 0. 2 ?µg?kg- 1 in liver), the tissue bound metabolite of <b>furaltadone.</b> There was no appreciable accumulation of nitrofurantoin in chicken muscle. The AHD metabolite was not detected in muscle from birds fed nitrofurantoin at either 30 or 100 ?µg?kg- 1. For nitrofurazone the concentrations of the SEM metabolite were higher in muscle than in liver for all dietary concentrations. The potential for a contaminated environment to cause nitrofuran residues in chickens was investigated. Six chickens were placed in a pen that was previously occupied by birds fed a diet containing 3000 ?µg?kg- 1 of furazolidone. After 24 hours¿ exposure of the chickens to the litter in the pen, AOZ residues of 0. 13 ?±? 0. 04 and 0. 10 ?±? 0. 03 ?µg?kg- 1 were detected in liver and muscle, respectively.

40|$|Abstract The use of {{nitrofuran}} {{veterinary drugs}} as antibacterial compounds in food-producing animals has been {{banned in the}} EU since 1995. As nitrofurans are extensive and rapidly metabolized, control of their illegal use in animal production must be done in edible tissues by LC-MS/MS analysis {{in order to determine}} persistent tissue-bound metabolites. The introduction during 2002 of the multi-residue detection of nitrofuran tissue-bound metabolites by LC-MS/MS for nitrofuran control in Portuguese Residues Monitoring Plan, revealed the presence of 5 -morpholinomethyl- 3 -amino- 2 -oxozolidinone (AMOZ), the bound residue of <b>furaltadone,</b> in a large number of samples, namely in meat poultry samples. From the 226 analysed samples in the last 4 months of 2002, 78 were non-compliant due to the presence of AMOZ (61 broilers, 11 turkeys, 5 quails and 1 pig). In this context, the aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the analytical data obtained on meat samples collected from various animal species under official Portuguese control for nitrofuran drug residues during the so-called “Portuguese nitrofuran crisis”.

40|$|Depletion of the {{nitrofuran}} antibiotics furazolidone, <b>furaltadone,</b> nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone {{and their}} tissue-bound metabolites AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM from pig muscle, {{liver and kidney}} tissues is described. Groups of pigs were given feed medicated {{with one of the}} nitrofuran drugs at a therapeutic concentration (400 ?mg?kg - 1) for ten days. Animals were slaughtered at intervals and tissue samples collected for analysis for six weeks following withdrawal of medicated feed. These samples were analysed both for parent nitrofurans (using LC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV), and for tissue-bound metabolites (using LC-MS/MS). The parent drugs were detectable only sporadically and only in pigs subjected to no withdrawal period whatsoever. This confirms the instability of the four major nitrofuran antibiotics in edible tissues. In contrast, the metabolites accumulated to high concentrations in tissues (ppm levels) and had depletion half lives of between 5. 5 and 15. 5 days. The metabolites of all four drugs were still readily detectable in tissues six weeks after cessation of treatment. This emphasizes the benefits of monitoring for the stable metabolites of the nitrofuran...|$|E
40|$|Within the EU, {{the use of}} {{nitrofurans}} {{is prohibited}} in food production animals. For this reason detection of these compounds in feedingstuffs, at whatever limit, constitutes an offence under EU legislation. This detection generally {{involves the use of}} analytical methods with limits of quantification lowers than 1  mg kg- 1. These procedures are unsuitable for the detection and confirmation of trace amounts of nitrofurans in feedingstuffs due to contamination. It is well known that very low concentrations of these compounds can be the source of residues of nitrofuran metabolites in meat and other edible products obtained from animals consuming the contaminated feed. The present multi-compound method was capable of measuring very low concentrations of nitrofurantoin (NFT), nitrofurazone (NFZ), furazolidone (FZD) and <b>furaltadone</b> (FTD) in animal feed using nifuroxazide (NXZ) as internal standard. Following ethyl acetate extraction at mild alkaline conditions and purification on NH 2 column, the nitrofurans are determined using liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection (LC-DAD). It was observed a CC[alpha] ranged from 50 to 100  [mu]g kg- 1.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of tet (34) was examined among oxytetracycline (OTC) resistant Vibrio strains isolated from Japan, Korea and the Philippines. tet (34) was detected in 10 isolates (6 in fish, 4 in seawater) from Japan and Korea, {{suggesting that it}} is widely distributed among fish and seawater bacteria in these countries. Ninety-eight percent of the Vibrio strains in the Philippines were sensitive to OTC, {{but none of the}} 60 isolates from the Philippines. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OTC-resistant isolates increased 2 to 8 fold in the presence of Mg 2 +, and MICs were higher in the Japanese and Korean isolates than the Philippine isolates. The MIC for <b>furaltadone</b> (FD) was low in Japanese (23. 9 %) isolates at over 3. 1 Î¼g/ml and high in Korean (50 %) and Philippine (56. 7 %) isolates. This was probably due to the different frequency of use of FD in these countries. Sequences of 16 S rDNA of tet (34) -positive isolates were 100 % identical, suggesting that tet (34) is conveyed in a particular Vibrio species.

40|$|Studies {{undertaken}} using radiolabelled furazolidone {{have demonstrated}} the covalent binding of residues of the drug to cellular protein in vivo. A portion of these bound residues and those formed by <b>furaltadone,</b> a related nitrofuran drug, possess intact side-chains, 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AOZ) and 5 -morpholinomethyl- 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AMOZ), respectively. These side-chains have molecular characteristics {{in common with the}} parent compounds and may be released from liver tissue under mild acidic conditions. Derivatization with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA) serves to isolate the released side-chains and the derivatives NPAOZ and NPAMOZ are chromophoric, thereby permitting UV detection. This paper reports the introduction of an extract clean-up step to the existing procedure which eliminates or decreases interference from NBA in the HPLC-UV determination of NPAOZ. The modified procedure was also applied to the determination of AMOZ. The development of an LC-MS method for the quantitative and confirmatory determination of AOZ and AMOZ extracted and derivatized according to the same procedure as that for HPLC-UV is described. The methods were validated for AOZ and AMOZ in fortified (intra- and inter-assay studies) and incurred (inter-assay studies) pig liver samples. The limit of determination for fortified control liver samples was 5 ng AOZ g- 1 and 10 ng AMOZ g- 1 by HPLC-UV and 10 ng AOZ or AMOZ g- 1 by LC-MS. In addition, a study to determine the ratio of released AOZ to the total bound residues present in incurred liver samples from pigs treated with furazolidone is described...|$|E
40|$|Nifursol has {{recently}} been prohibited {{for use as a}} feed additive. Considering the similarity in structure between nifursol and the other nitrofurans, an analogous metabolism could be expected. To study the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry, broilers were treated orally with nifursol during a period of 7 consecutive days, via medicated feed at a dosage of 50 mg/kg feed. Muscle, kidney, liver, bile and plasma samples were collected at the day of cessation of medication (day 0) and at days 3, 7, 14 and 21 after the end of medication. Samples were analysed for nifursol and the acid-hydrolysable side-chain of nifursol (DNSH; 3, 5 -dinitro salicylhydrazide). Samples were also analysed for the ratio between free (solvent-extractable) metabolites and tissue-bound (non-extractable) metabolites. The results obtained clearly indicate the formation of tissue-bound residues in poultry. Concentrations of non-extractable residue at zero withdrawal time averaged to 900 µg/kg in liver tissue, 2000 µg/kg in kidney tissue, 225 µg/kg in muscle tissue, 1000 µg/kg in bile and 1000 µg/kg in plasma. Taking into account an LoD of 1 µg/kg, non-extractable residues of DNSH can be detected for at least 3 weeks after administration in liver, kidney, bile and plasma and for up to 2 weeks in muscle tissue. The amounts of extractable residues were relatively low, in many instances less than 10 % of the total amount of residue. In general terms the depletion data obtained show a similar behaviour of nifursol in broilers as previously found for furazolidone and <b>furaltadone</b> in broilers...|$|E
40|$|RarA is an AraC-type {{regulator}} in Klebsiella pneumoniae, which, when overexpressed, confers {{a low-level}} multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype {{linked to the}} upregulation of both the acrAB and oqxAB efflux genes. Increased rarA expression {{has also been shown}} to be integral in the development of tigecycline resistance in the absence of ramA in K. pneumoniae. Given its phenotypic role inMDR, microarray analyses were performed to determine the RarA regulon. Transcriptome analysis was undertaken using strains Ecl 8 rarA/pACrarA- 2 (rarA-expressing construct) and Ecl 8 rarA/pACYC 184 (vector-only control) using bespoke mi-croarray slides consisting of probes derived from the genomic sequences of K. pneumoniaeMGH 78578 (NC_ 009648. 1) and Kp 342 (NC_ 011283. 1). Our results show that rarA overexpression resulted in the differential expression of 66 genes (42 upregu-lated and 24 downregulated). Under the COG (clusters of orthologous groups) functional classification, the majority of affected genes belonged to the category of cell envelope biogenesis and posttranslational modification, along with genes encoding the previously uncharacterized transport proteins (e. g., KPN_ 03141, sdaCB, and leuE) and the porin OmpF. However, genes associ-ated with energy production and conversion and amino acid transport/metabolism (e. g., nuoA, narJ, and proWX) were found to be downregulated.

Present results showed that analysis of NFs in broiler chicken meat can be done using an HPLC and the analysis results from field samples showed that these types of drugs were being used for broiler chicken production both as single and/or combination drugs, therefore it is necessary to raise public awareness to monitor the use of NF in livestock production in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Nitrofurans are {{synthetic}} broad-spectrum antimicobial {{agents that}} are often used in commercial animal production because of their excellent antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties. However, nitrofurans and their metabolites {{have been shown to}} have potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic characteristics which has led to a ban on the use of nitrofurans in preventive and therapeutic treatment of animals used for food production. Metabolites of nitrofurans that can be determined after their application are: a metabolite of furazolidone, <b>furaltadone</b> metabolite, a metabolite of nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone metabolite. The presence of residues of nitrofuran antibiotics in meat, fish and shrimps, and milk and eggs originating from countries outside the European Union is monitored and recorded by the RASFF system of the European Union. Furthermore, since nitrofurans are used in some countries as prophylactic agents and growth promoters, it is necessary to carry out constant control of various types of food of animal origin, in order to reduce to the minimum potential carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of these supstances for the health of consumers. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is no permanent control of nitrofurans in food of animal origin. The provisions of the „Regulation on the maximum allowable amounts of veterinary drugs and pesticides in products of animal origin", published in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina state the prohibiting of the use of certain veterinary drugs in animals intended for human consumption, including nitrofurans. The European Union has established the minimum required limit (MRLP) for performance which is 1 μg/kg of nitrofurans for edible tissues of animal origin. Taking all this into account, methods for nitrofurans detection should be accreditated and validated, both for screening and confirmatory methods, and further research into the presence of nitrofurans in food of animal origin in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be performed...|$|E
