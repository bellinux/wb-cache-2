50|$|Second is {{the patch}} reef community. Patch reefs form {{in shallow water}} (three to six meters deep), some in Hawk Channel and some on the outer reef, but mainly on White Bank between Hawk Channel and the outer reefs. Patch reefs start from corals growing on a hard bottom, but grow upward as new corals {{establish}} themselves on the skeletons of dead corals. Most {{of the structure of}} patch reefs is formed from star (Montastraea annularis, Siderastrea siderea) and brain corals (Diploria spp.). Other corals attach wherever there is an opening. Patch reefs may grow up {{to the surface of the}} water, and spread outwards. Dome-type patch reefs (such as Hen and Chickens), found in Hawk Channel and on White Bank, are round or elliptical, and are generally less than three meters high, but may reach up to nine meters high. Dome-type patch reefs are surrounded by sand which is kept clear due to browsing by long-spined sea urchins and grass-eating fish. Linear-type patch reefs are found on the outer reefs, and are linear or curved. They occur in single or multiple rows, trending the same direction as the bank reefs on the outer reefs. Linear-type patch reefs often include Elkhorn coral, which is rare on the dome-type patch reefs. As dead coral skeletons age and are weakened by the activities of boring sponges, worms, and mollusks and by wave action, parts of a patch reef may collapse. Patch reefs provide habitat for spiny lobsters and for many species of fish, including Bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), damselfish (Chromis spp.), Ocean surgeon, French and Queen angelfish (Pomacanthus spp.), White, Caesar and Spanish grunts (Haemulon ssp.), Yellowtail and other snappers, Redband and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma ssp.), Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), Tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum), Trumpetfish (Aulostomus maculatus), filefish, groupers, snappers, Bar jack (Caranx ruber), Great barracuda, pufferfish, squirrelfish, cardinalfish, and <b>green</b> <b>morays</b> (Gymnothorax funebris).|$|R

Watch your loved ones as they stand in the center of our 6 ft coral reef tank and feel like the fish are swimming right across your body! Exhibits and tanks in the Aquariums of the Atlantic reinforce the importance of stewardship of these environments and the long-term effects humans have on the oceans and wildlife. As you walk into the aquarium the largest exhibit is our Shipwreck Cove, a 3,500 gallon predator tank teeming with grunts, sharks, a giant <b>green</b> <b>moray</b> eel, white fin remoras, lobsters and fierce barracudas. All of these treasures are swimming in and out of an eerie Florida sunken shipwreck.

These species of fish hail from the Red Sea, Hawaiian Islands, Indo- Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of granulomatous dermatitis {{was investigated in}} a captive population of moray eels. The affected eels had florid skin nodules concentrated around the head and trunk. Histopathological examination revealed extensive granulomatous inflammation within the dermis and subcutaneous fascial plane between the fat and axial musculature. Acid-fast rods were detected within the smallest lesions, which were presumably the ones that had developed earliest. Eventually, after several months of incubation at room temperature, a very slowly growing acid-fast organism was isolated. Sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene identified it as a Mycobacterium species closely related (0. 59 % divergence) to M. triplex, an SAV mycobacterium. Intradermal inoculation of healthy <b>green</b> <b>moray</b> eels with this organism reliably reproduced the lesion. Experimentally induced granulomatous dermatitis appeared within 2 weeks of inoculation and slowly but progressively expanded during the 2 months of the experiment. Live organisms were recovered from these lesions at all time points, fulfilling Koch's postulates for this bacterium. In a retrospective study of tissues collected between 1993 and 1999 from five spontaneous disease cases, acid-fast rods were consistently found within lesions, and a nested PCR for the rRNA gene also demonstrated the presence of mycobacteria within affected tissues...|$|E
