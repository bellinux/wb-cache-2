40|$|The model {{developed}} by Pedlosky and Young {{is used to}} <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>feedback</b> of a Rhines-Young pool on a ventilated thermocline. It is found that the potential vorticity gradient in a ventilated layer is reduced due to the nonlinear coupling with a deep Rhines-Young pool. Physically, this occurs because part of the Sverdrup transport is carried by the deep pool. As a result, the subduction velocity, and in turn, the potential vorticity gradient of the subducted water, is decreased. -Author...|$|E

In addition, we demonstrate the effects of diffusive vertical mixing of soil organic matter by cryoturbation on the total carbon stocks that the model builds up in mineral soils in equilibrium with a steady climate. We show that including these two effects together leads to up to 30 % higher soil carbon stocks in the top meter of permafrost soils, as well as large stocks of carbon below 1 m in the upper permafrost soil layers. The vertical profile of partitioning of carbon between different lability pools is also affected, as the slower pools are more deeply mixed; also the time to reach equilibrium lengthens considerably. These effects are largest in the coldest regions such as Eastern Siberia. The inclusion of cryoturbative mixing and insulation by soil carbon leads to better agreement with estimates of high-latitude soil carbon stocks, where substantial amounts of carbon are found in permafrost regions, to depths of three meters; however we do not include peat, Yedoma, or alluvial deposition processes here, so the total carbon stocks are still lower than observed...|$|E

Key documents {{such as the}} Senior Syllabus in Mathematics B (Board of Senior Secondary School Studies (BSSSS), 1992), A National Statement on Mathematics for Australian Schools (Australian Education Council (AEC), 1991) and the Assessment Standards for school Mathematics (National CS) _uncil of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), 1995) called for <b>the</b> use of <b>feedback</b> to improve student learning. Examination of the literature demonstrated the need for research <b>investigating</b> <b>the</b> implementation of <b>feedback</b> procedures in <b>the</b> classroom. The limited existing literature examining teachers' actual use of <b>feedback</b> suggested <b>the</b> related factors of mathematics assessment, teaching practices and classroom culture need to be considered. Due {{to the absence of}} definitive literature describing teachers' use of <b>feedback</b> in <b>the</b> classroom, an exploratory, interpretive, qualitative approach was adopted. The descriptive case study of one teacher provided the depth of investigation necessary to describe <b>the</b> teacher's <b>feedback</b> practices and to illustrate the factors influencing these practices. There was found to be a close relationship between the nature of the classroom culture and <b>the</b> type of <b>feedback</b> that was used. In this classroom <b>the</b> focus of <b>feedback</b> on marks, <b>the</b> correct solution and examination recommendations demonstrated the value placed on achieving the correct solution during assessment. The classroom culture was not conducive to the provision of informative feedback or its use by the students. In its place was a definite culture of marks, tacitly agreed upon by both the teacher and the students. The depth of description of the case enables teachers to compare the context of the case to their personal situations and to make judgements about heir own feedback practices. Future research may <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> conditions necessary for a culture where feedback is valued. Alternatively <b>the</b> theoretical <b>feedback</b> procedures may be investigated to examine how they may be implemented in a culture valuing marks and the correct solution...|$|R
