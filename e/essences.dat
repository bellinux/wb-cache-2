5|$|Link {{receives}} a sword from Impa {{and makes his}} way to the Maku Tree in Lynna City, the capital of Labrynna. The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; Link uses a time portal to travel to the past to prevent this. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight <b>Essences</b> of Time to defeat Veran. Link sets out to retrieve the eight <b>Essences,</b> hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, Link is told he has the opportunity to save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi. Link gathers the remaining <b>Essences</b> and brings them to the Maku Tree, who uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed that allows Link to enter Veran's Black Tower. Link ascends the tower and defeats Veran. He rescues Queen Ambi, and Nayru tells him that all has returned to normal. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that Veran has lit the Flame of Sorrow.|$|E
5|$|Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link {{that they}} were headed for Hyrule; she instructs {{him to see the}} Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight <b>Essences</b> of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight <b>Essences,</b> hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for {{safekeeping}} concerning World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the <b>essences</b> of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life <b>essences</b> of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{agreed that the}} Revelation Thesis about {{experience}} – {{the idea that the}} knowledge we gain by having an experience somehow “reveals” the <b>essence,</b> or nature, of this experience – only requires that we know the <b>essence</b> of the experience, not that we know, of this <b>essence,</b> that it is the <b>essence</b> of the experience. I contest this agreement. In the light of what I call the “Essentiality of <b>Essence</b> Principle”– the principle that whatever is in the <b>essence</b> of something is also essentially so – I argue that the Revelation Thesis does require that we know, of the <b>essence</b> of an experience, that it is the <b>essence</b> of the experience, and draw some conclusions about the plausibility of that thesis...|$|R
25|$|<b>Essence</b> is {{a measure}} of a living being's lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower <b>Essence).</b> It powers magic, and as <b>essence</b> fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of {{substance}} addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage its <b>essence</b> as well. Generally, if a being's <b>essence</b> ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an <b>essence</b> rating of zero or less.|$|R
5|$|<b>Essence</b> is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's <b>essence</b> capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum <b>essence</b> summons a creature which costs 20 <b>essence,</b> their maximum <b>essence</b> is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain <b>essence.</b> A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more <b>essence</b> to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic increase costs more <b>essence</b> and reduces the amount of <b>essence</b> available to summon other creations or cast spells. <b>Essence</b> and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|R
5|$|The Returners set out {{to search}} for Terra and {{eventually}} trace her {{to the city of}} Zozo, though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper. There, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire's capital, Vector, they may find one who can help Terra. Vector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who {{is believed to be the}} owner of the Blackjack, the only airship in the world. They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including Maduin, who is revealed to be Terra's father. However, the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector, and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite—the crystallized remains of the espers' <b>essences</b> that form when they die and allow others to use their powers. The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners. Before the group can then escape, Kefka arrives and causes the Returners, including Locke, to momentarily doubt Celes' loyalty, much to her anguish. However, she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape. The rest of the group then returns to Zozo, where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father, prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half-human, half-esper child of Maduin and a human woman.|$|E
25|$|The {{larger context}} in which Wittgenstein's {{philosophy}} is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to <b>essences,</b> mental entities {{and other forms of}} idealism which were accepted {{as a matter of fact}} in continental philosophy at the turn of the preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its uncritical use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. Abstraction is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives <b>essences,</b> but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.|$|E

40|$|COTUS {{argues in}} his mature Questions on the Metaphysics Book 7 {{that there are}} what we may call ‘singular essences’: Socrates, for example, has an <b>essence</b> that {{includes}} more than his human nature, which is his specific essence; he has an <b>essence</b> proper to himself alone, an <b>essence</b> that cannot be had by anyone else. Although Socrates does have singular (individualized) forms, his singular <b>essence</b> is not a form—there is no form Socrateity for the singular <b>essence</b> parallelling the form humanity for the specific <b>essence.</b> Instead, Socrates has his singu-lar <b>essence</b> in consequence of being an individual, that is, in consequence of having an ‘individual differentia’. Scotus further rejects the distinction be-tween identity and individuality, maintaining that what it is for Socrates to be Socrates {{is the same as}} what it is for him to be an individual. Socrates, in the end, is his singular <b>essence.</b> Scotus’s arguments in support of the singular <b>essence</b> are spread through Book 7. He devotes only one question directly to the singular <b>essence</b> (7. 7) ...|$|R

25|$|His {{original}} contribution to philosophy was De essentiis (On <b>essences).</b> In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo).

50|$|Henry {{argued that}} not only do {{individual}} creatures have a being corresponding to their <b>essence</b> - the being of <b>essence</b> or esse essentiae, {{they also have a}} 'somethingness' (aliquitas). The being created by God is not the being of actual existence, but the being of <b>essence,</b> also called esse latissimum (being in the widest sense), or esse communissimum, the most general form of being. The determination of <b>essence</b> respecting its being made actual is a delimitation, or specification, of that being. Thus, esse essentiae comes first, then comes esse aliquid per essentiam, being a something through <b>essence,</b> finally the whole <b>essence</b> thus made up is put into actuality.|$|R
25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal <b>essences</b> are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar <b>Essences</b> as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to the inherently poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect for anything else) and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E

The main images of Qian and Kun are Heaven and Earth, which are immutably joined to one another.
