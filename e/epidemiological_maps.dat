40|$|SummaryGeographical {{information}} systems (GIS) use {{for development of}} <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> in dengue has been extensively used, however not in other emerging arboviral diseases, nor in Central America. Surveillance cases data (2015) were used to estimate annual incidence rates of dengue and chikungunya (cases/ 100, 000 pop) to develop the first maps in the departments and municipalities of Honduras. The GIS software used was Kosmo Desktop 3. 0 RC 1 ®. Four thematic maps were developed according departments, municipalities, diseases incidence rates. A total of 19, 289 cases of dengue and 85, 386 of chikungunya were reported (median, 726 cases/week for dengue and 1460 for chikungunya). Highest peaks were observed at weeks 25 th and 27 th, respectively. There was association between progression by weeks (p 37 %, both).

Surveillance case data (2007 – 2011) were used to estimate annual incidence rates per Plasmodium spp. (cases/ 100, 000 pop) to develop the first malaria maps in the 53 municipalities of this region (departments Caldas, Quindío, Risaralda). The GIS software used was Kosmo Desktop 3. 0 RC 1 ®. Thirty thematic maps were developed according to the municipalities, years, parasite etiology, and uncomplicated and complicated cases. A total of 6582 cases were reported (6478 uncomplicated and 104 complicated, 77. 8 % Risaralda), for a cumulated rate of 269. 46 cases/ 100, 000 pop. Among uncomplicated cases, 5722 corresponded to P. vivax (234. 25 cases/ 100, 000 pop), 475 to P. falciparum (19. 45 cases/ 100, 000 pop), 8 to P. malariae (0. 33 cases/ 100, 000 pop) and 273 mixed (P. falciparum/P. vivax) (11. 18 cases/ 100, 000 pop). The highest rate reported was in the more undeveloped and rural municipality of Risaralda (Pueblo Rico, 57. 7 cases/ 1000 pop, 2009).

40|$|Objective: Geographical {{information}} systems (GIS) have been extensively {{used for the}} development of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> of tropical diseases, however not yet specifically for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Methods: Surveillance case data of the ongoing epidemics of ZIKV in the Tolima department, Colombia (2015 - 2016) were used to estimate cumulative incidence rates (cases/ 100, 000 pop.) to develop the first maps in the department and its municipalities, including detail for the capital, Ibagué. The GIS software used was Kosmo Desktop 3. 0 RC 1 ®. Two thematic maps were developed according to municipality and communes incidence rates. Results: Up to March 5, 2016, 4, 094 cases of ZIKV were reported in Tolima, for cumulated rates of 289. 9 cases/ 100, 000 pop. (7. 95 % of the country). Burden of ZIKV infection has been concentrated in its east area, where municipalities have reported > 500 cases/ 100, 000 pop. These municipalities are bordered by two other departments, Cundinamarca (3, 778 cases) and Huila (5, 338 cases), which also have high incidences of ZIKV infection. Seven municipalities of Tolima ranged from 250 - 499. 99 cases/ 100, 000 pop., of this group five border with high incidence municipalities (> 250), including the capital, where almost half of the reported cases of ZIKV in Tolima are concentrated.

40|$|Abstract. We {{applied the}} {{techniques}} of spatial auto-correlation (SA) analysis to 40 cancer mortality dis-tributions in Western Europe. One of the aims of these methods is to describe the scale over which spatial patterns of mortalities occur, which may provide suggestions concerning the agents bringing about the patterns. We analyzed 355 registration areas, applying one- and two-dimensional SA {{as well as local}} SA techniques. We find that cancer mortali-ties are unusually strongly spatially structured, im-plying similar spatial structuring of the responsible agents. The small number of spatial patterns (4 or 5) in the 40 cancer mortalities suggests there are fewer spatially patterned agents than the number of cancers studied. SA present in variables will bias the results of conventional statistical tests applied to them. After correcting for such bias, some pairwise correlations of cancer mortality distributions remain significant, suggesting inherent, epidemiologically meaningful correlations. Local SA is a useful technique for ex-ploring <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps.</b> It found homogeneous high overall cancer mortalities in Denmark and homogeneous low mortalities in southern Italy, as well as a very heterogeneous pattern for ovarian cancer in Ireland...|$|E

40|$|Hospital infections {{represent}} a major epidemiological problem. The {{first step in}} the detection of nosocomial infections consists in assessing the probability that two or more isolates from different patients are similar or different. Many methods are available for typing purposes. Among these, antibiotic susceptibility patterns do not need extra cost or extra work and are available "on line" every moment they are needed. A mathematical technique of elaboration is proposed for disk zone sizes, in order to assess the probability of two or more clinical isolates to be the same strain. Antibiograms performed according to Kirby-Bauer are evaluated detecting zone sizes by a computer controlled device and then submitted to cluster analysis. Similarity of strains is reported in a dendrogram, in which strains are successively fused. Strains that share a common susceptibility pattern are considered a "cluster". At last, <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> are constructed for each group of strains, in which all the isolates are reported, ordered for patients, plotted on the day the specimen was collected, drawn in a different shape according to the source of specimen, and shadowed by the pattern of its cluster.

40|$|Abstract: Xenorhabdus spp. and Photorhabdus spp. are {{symbiotic}} bacteria that produce numerous metabolites of insecticidal and bactericidal impact. It {{was thought that}} these biological metabolites gave them the privilege of predominance in the gut of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). The aim of this work was to investigate and characterize the associated bacteria with {{symbiotic bacteria}} Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus in-vitro culture of EPNs (Heterorhabditis indica RM 1, Heterorhabditis sp. S 1 and Steinernema abbasi). The gut flora of EPNs were isolated and characterized morphologically and biochemically. The isolated associated strains were completely identified by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and sequence analyses of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA. The isolated strains were Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus pumilus associated with Photorhabdus luminescens akhurstii in the gut of H. indica RM 1 and Heterorhabditis sp. S 1 (Egyptian isolates). Also Enterobacter cloacae were associated with X. indica in the gut of S. abbasi (Omani isolate). These associated isolates are raising the concern about their effect in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> in Egypt, Oman and their significance as public health threats.

40|$|That {{there are}} so few {{examples}} of the use of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> in malaria control may be explained by the lack of suitable, spatially defined data and of an understanding of how epidemiological variables relate to disease outcome. However, recent evidence suggests that the clinical outcomes of infection are determined by the intensity of parasite exposure, and developments in geographical information systems (GIS) provide new ways to represent epidemiological data spatially. In the present study, parasitological data from 682 cross-sectional surveys conducted in Kenya were abstracted and spatially defined. Risks of infection with Plasmodium falciparum among Kenyan children, estimated from combinations of parasitological, geographical, demographic and climatic data in a GIS platform, appear to be low for 2. 9 million, stable but low for another 1. 3 million, moderate for 3. 0 million and high for 0. 8 million. (Estimates were not available for 1. 4 million children.) Whilst the parasitological data were obtained {{from a variety of sources}} across different age-groups and times, these markers of endemicity remained relatively stable within the broad definitions of high, moderate and low transmission intensity. Models relating ecological and climatic features to malaria intensity and improvements in our understanding of the relationships between parasite exposure and disease outcome will hopefully provide a more rational basis for malaria control in the near future...|$|E

This is also true for African trypanosomoses, {{a group of diseases}} of both humans and animals caused by protozoa of the Genus Trypanosoma, and transmitted by tsetse flies (Genus Glossina). In this thesis the knowledge gaps and the requirements for an evidence-based decision making in the field of tsetse and trypanosomoses are identified, with a focus on georeferenced data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Datasets, tools and analyses are presented that aim to fill some of the identified knowledge gaps. For the human form of the disease, also known as sleeping sickness, case detection and treatment are the mainstay of control, so that accurate knowledge of the geographic distribution of infections is paramount. In this study, an Atlas was developed that provides village-level information on the reported occurrence of sleeping sickness. The geodatabase underpinning the Atlas also includes the results of active screening activities, even when no cases were detected. The Atlas enables <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> to be generated at a range of scales, from local to global, thus providing evidence for strategic and technical decision making. In the field of animal trypanosomosis control, also known as nagana, much emphasis has recently been placed on the vector.

HIV is a socially significant disease, tends to increase in cases both in the RME and in the Russian Federation. This issue is a matter of concern and has been under consideration at the state level. In 2016, the Government of the Russian Federation approved the State Strategy for Counteracting the Spread of HIV Infection in Russia for the period to 2020 and further prospects. Implementation of this strategy requires a detailed approach, taking into account modern technologies, the capabilities of which should be used in an accurate and step-by-step manner. The study analyzed the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> of the patients of the state budgetary institution of the Republic of Mari El “Republican Center for the Prevention and Control of AIDS and Infectious Diseases” (SBI RME RCPC AIDS and ID), calculated the incidence and prevalence of the population of the Republic using statistical methods (calculations of relative and average values, building of dynamic series and estimation of statistically significant differences), used graphicalanalytical methods and a retrospective epidemiologic analysis. According to the results of the study for the period 2007 - 2016, an increase in the incidence of 2. 2 times was revealed in the RME. The cumulative number of HIV-positive patients in the RME during the study period increased 3. 3 times. The prevalence index in 2016 in the RME is 1. 7 times lower than the Russian average.

40|$|Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a an {{environmental}} organism, {{that in recent}} years has been isolated with increasing frequency as an opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infections as well as from the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Despite its growing clinical importance, the mechanisms adopted by this organism to establish persistent infections have not been clarified yet. The availability of information on genome sequence of two S. maltophilia strains (K 279 a and R 551 - 3), allow development of new post-genomic approaches direct to understanding of key factors involved in the colonization of respiratory tract of CF patients and of cellular and molecular mechanisms of its pathogenicity. Identification of S. maltophilia genes expressed inside host, is essential for development of new antimicrobial compounds. Moreover, molecular and genetic characterization of S. maltophilia clinical strains is essential to understand pathogenicity mechanism of these organisms and to build detailed <b>epidemiological</b> <b>maps</b> to draw their spread in CF patients. The present study is aimed at determining the genomic and epidemiological relatedness of 52 S. maltophilia strains. Strains included 43 clinical collected, between January 2003 and December 2005, from 43 independent patients (41 were from CF patients, and two from blood cultures of two non-CF patients) attending the Paediatric Hospital “Bambino Gesù” of Rome. Other strains were: K 279 a and LMG 958, two S. maltophilia reference clinical strains, and seven strains of environmental origin (two isolated within the Hospital “Bambino Gesù”). In these strains the presence and expression of the virulence-associated genes were evaluated and their contribution to virulence was assessed using larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella as an infection model. To confirm a role of the putative virulence factors identified we constructed K 279 a (the clinical reference strain whose genome sequence is available) mutants and performed complementation assay with the wild type functional gene. Moreover, to study genomic evolution of S. maltophilia toward a pathogenic lifestyle, we compare the genome of {{an environmental}} strain with that of the clinical strain K 279 a. Genotyping analysis. Data that we obtained indicates PFGE fingerprinting as the most discriminatory technique to characterize genomospecies present in S. maltophilia. All strains produced well-defined PFGE profiles: forty-seven different PFGE pulsotypes were identified, indicating a remarkable genomic diversity among the strains analysed. Three clusters (pulsotype 1, 17 and 33) showed a banding pattern identical to at least 1 other isolate likely indicating either cross-transmission among patients or infection from a common source. However, the results obtained with the RFLP of gyrB gene and with the variable regions of the 16 S rRNA gene clearly indicated that certain phylogenetic groups are likely better able to cause infection than others. Identification and characterization of virulence genes involved in S. maltophilia pathogenicity. All 52 S. maltophilia strains were characterized for the presence and expression of type- 1 fimbria, esterase, proteases (StmPr 1 and StmPr 2). Regarding the type- 1 fimbria, only the clinical strains showed the presence of the gene coding for this surface structure, indicating that it might be an important virulence factor of this opportunistic pathogen. The expression of esterase activity by most CF-derived S. maltophilia strains, reinforces the hypothesis that esterase, such as fimbria, may play some role in the virulence. In order to verify the role of these potential virulence factors in S. maltophilia pathogenesis, representative S. maltophilia strains unable to express proteases or esterase were assayed in G. mellonella infection. The results indicate that proteases may be relevant virulence factors of S. maltophilia. Moreover, the type- 1 fimbria could play an important role since the environmental strains, lacking of smf- 1, show the higher lethal dose (LD 50). To analyze the relative role of the two proteases (StmPr 1 and StmPr 2), the OBGTC 23 strain, naturally impaired in protease expression, was complemented with the StmPr 1 or StmPr 2 functional genes and tested in G. mellonella assay. Data obtained showed that StmPr 1 protease play a major role in S. maltophilia pathogenesis. Analysis of the role of S. maltophilia virulence factors by mutants construction. In the complex, the results that we obtained using different clinical OBGTC strains, impaired in the expression of one or more hypothetical virulence factors, indicates proteases as important virulence determinants for S. maltophilia. Nevertheless, these natural mutant strains could lack of many others virulence determinants that may be involved in pathogenesis process. Then, to study the effect of the single factors identified and to confirm their role, deletions encompassing different putative virulence genes are introduced by allelic exchange in reference strain K 279 a, whose genome sequence is available. The proteases mutants showed a strong reduction of the protease activity and were less virulent, compared to wild-type, in G. mellonella larvae, confirming that proteases, particularly StmPr 1, are important virulence factors for S. maltophilia. The proteases expression is controlled by the diffusible signal factor (DSF) a quorum sensing signal molecule that controls the expression of several virulence factors. Moreover, the DSF mutant reveals a greater reduction of virulence in G. mellonella infection model, compared to that of proteases mutants, suggesting a DSF involvement in the control of proteases but also of other virulence factors. Finally, despite fimbriae are important to establish chronic infection in airways CF patients, this surface structures may be not important in G. mellonella infection model. Genomic evolution of S. maltophilia toward a pathogenic lifestyle. To identify the specific genetic determinants acquired from S. maltophilia during its evolution towards a more pathogenic lifestyle, we performed a Suppression Subtractive Hybridization: this technique allowed us to identify the genetic sequences present in the clinical strain K 279 a and absent in the environmental strain LMG 959. The majority of the subtracted sequence may have been acquired from other organisms by horizontal gene transfers, since their different G+C content and since the presence of several IS elements. Among the sequence, particularly interesting are genes coding for haemagglutinin, Clp protease, TonB dependent receptor protein, and a putative ankyrin repeat-containing protein, which are known to be important virulence factors in many gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, many of the subtracted sequence represent genes involved in metabolism, DNA restriction/modification system, transmembrane proteins, hypothetical proteins and proteins with unknown function. These differences between S. maltophilia K 279 a and S. maltophilia LMG 959 could be related to niche adaptation or host preference and this accessory genome may represents an advantage for pathogen evolution driven by the need for continuous adaptation to the host in order to evade or suppress coevolving host defense mechanisms, making it an emergent opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infections...|$|E

40|$|The {{operational}} and diagnostic {{performance of}} a two-step method for the cost-effective screening of urinary schistosomiasis was investigated in the Kilosa District of east-central Tanzania. In the first step a simple questionnaire was administered to 15, 073 primary schoolchildren by their class teachers over a 4 -week period. The answers to the questionnaires had a high negative predictive value for schistosomiasis, and this permitted the safe exclusion of schools where {{the risk of the}} disease was low. In the second step, the head-teachers of the 49 high-risk schools and of 26 low-risk schools were instructed on the use of reagent sticks to detect haematuria. Each head-teacher then performed this test on 80 children selected at random in their schools (5750 children were screened within 6 weeks). Crosschecks of the results in 18 schools confirmed the reliability of the head-teachers' testing and their findings were therefore used to prepare an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>map</b> of the district and to arrange for treatment of positive children. This two-step approach relied entirely on the existing school system and permitted screening of a rural district of area 15, 000 km 2 (population, 350, 000) over a 4 -month period at a cost of only US$ 3000...|$|R
40|$|<b>Epidemiological</b> <b>mapping</b> {{and risk}} {{profiling}} {{build on the}} idea that diseases are tied to social-ecological systems that govern the distribution and abundance of transmissible pathogens, vectors and hosts. This {{is the heart of the}} emerging field of ecohealth, which examines how biological, cultural, demographic, economic, physical, political and social environments change and how these changes affect the health and wellbeing of humans, animals and ecosystems and the services they provide. This paper is an overview of a special issue of Acta Tropica, whose 15 publications reflect a geographically and epidemiologically diverse landscape of ecohealth. Nowhere is an ecohealth approach better suited than in Africa and its myriad of landscapes that include contexts varying from profuse expanses of tropical rain forests to the world's greatest desert. The publication of African ecohealth-related projects displays a biological, cultural and social diversity in health system contexts and a wide variety of contributions pertaining to different, often neglected, tropical diseases, including brucellosis, Buruli ulcer, fascioliasis, malaria, Q fever, rabies, Rift Valley fever and schistosomiasis. Pursuing an ecohealth approach provides a platform that brings together community members, decision makers, scientists and other stakeholders with a view to understand how ecosystem changes affect health conditions. Taken together, the presentation of this variety of papers dealing with environmental variables associated with health inaugurates the vital concept of ecohealth. By emphasizing that all organisms are part of social-ecological systems, the long-term wellbeing of both people and animals depending on healthy and productive ecosystems is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio cholerae is a {{globally}} important pathogen that is endemic in {{many areas}} of the world and causes 3 – 5 [*]million reported cases of cholera every year. Historically, there have been seven acknowledged cholera pandemics; recent outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Haiti are included in the seventh and ongoing pandemic 1. Only isolates in serogroup O 1 (consisting of two biotypes known as ‘classical’ and ‘El Tor’) and the derivative O 139 (refs 2, 3) can cause epidemic cholera 2. It is believed that the first six cholera pandemics were caused by the classical biotype, but El Tor has subsequently spread globally and replaced the classical biotype in the current pandemic 1. Detailed molecular <b>epidemiological</b> <b>mapping</b> of cholera has been compromised by a reliance on sub-genomic regions such as mobile elements to infer relationships, making El Tor isolates associated with the seventh pandemic seem superficially diverse. To understand the underlying phylogeny of the lineage responsible for the current pandemic, we identified high-resolution markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in 154 whole-genome sequences of globally and temporally representative V. [*]cholerae isolates. Using this phylogeny, we show here that the seventh pandemic has spread from the Bay of Bengal in at least three independent but overlapping waves with a common ancestor in the 1950 s, and identify several transcontinental transmission events. Additionally, we show how the acquisition of the SXT family of antibiotic resistance elements has shaped pandemic spread, and show that this family was first acquired at least ten years before its discovery in V.

The study captured the Local Government Areas in Abia State that were assessed by Rapid <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Mapping</b> for Onchocerciasis (REMO) as being hyper-endemic for onchocerciasis and which have been receiving ivermectin for over 14 years. A study questionnaire was designed to investigate the rate of compliance and this was distributed to 558 individuals. The result showed that out of 558 individuals, 309 (55. 4 %) had taken the drug before while 249 (44. 6 %) claimed they have not been treated before. Despite the treatment over time, only 70 (22. 7 %) of those treated before were high compliers (that is, those who had been treated eight times and above). The overall percentage of high compliers in the sampled communities was only 12. 6 %. Reasons for low compliance include “lack of information on the arrival of drug ” (27. 8 %), “no reason for refusal ” (22. 2 %),” absent, away from village ” (20. 0 %) and “no distribution ” (19. 7 %). In testing the reasons for low compliance, the Chi-square analytical technique on the data revealed that the reasons given by the respondents for low compliance were not significant (χ 2 cal = 1. 797 < χ 2 tab = 16. 9190), and therefore do not affect general compliance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study on the presence of various species of filarial nematodes in dogs in Liguria, north-west Italy, a region traditionally considered free from the disease. Between 2009 and 2012 blood samples were taken from 365 dogs in rural areas in Liguria. The blood samples were then submitted to Knott's test, histochemical staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Dirofilaria immitis antigens. Overall, 35 of the 365 dogs were positive using Knott's test for microfilariae (prevalence 9. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 6. 6 - 12. 6 %). Acanthocheilonema reconditum was the most prevalent species (8. 0 %), while Dirofilaria repens (1. 4 %) and Dirofilaria immitis (0. 6 %) were less common. One co-infection by D. repens and A. reconditum was observed. All morphological identifications were confirmed by histochemical staining and PCR. In addition, a retrospective analysis of data on D. immitis antigens in 11, 363 samples of canine sera was carried out. Sera were collected and analysed for D. immitis antigens by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale (IZS) of Piedmont, Liguria and Aosta Valley (Imperia section) between 2004 and 2013 during annual tests for leishmaniasis on autochthonous dogs throughout Liguria. Serological data from IZS showed an overall seroprevalence of 0. 65 % (95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 80 %) for D. immitis throughout the region. The present study updates the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>map</b> of canine filarial infections in Italy and suggests the need for surveillance and prophylaxis in Liguria...|$|R

40|$|Background The initial {{endemicity}} (pre-control prevalence) of onchocerciasis {{has been}} shown to be an important determinant of the feasibility of elimination by mass ivermectin distribution. We present the first geostatistical map of microfilarial prevalence in the former Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) before commencement of antivectorial and antiparasitic interventions. Methods and Findings Pre-control microfilarial prevalence data from 737 villages across the 11 constituent countries in the OCP epidemiological database were used as ground-truth data. These 737 data points, plus a set of statistically selected environmental covariates, were used in a Bayesian model-based geostatistical (B-MBG) approach to generate a continuous surface (at pixel resolution of 5 km x 5 km) of microfilarial prevalence in West Africa prior to the commencement of the OCP. Uncertainty in model predictions was measured using a suite of validation statistics, performed on bootstrap samples of held-out validation data. The mean Pearson's correlation between observed and estimated prevalence at validation locations was 0. 693; the mean prediction error (average difference between observed and estimated values) was 0. 77 %, and the mean absolute prediction error (average magnitude of difference between observed and estimated values) was 12. 2 %. Within OCP boundaries, 17. 8 million people were deemed to have been at risk, 7. 55 million to have been infected, and mean microfilarial prevalence to have been 45 % (range: 2 - 90 %) in 1975. Conclusions and Significance This is the first map of initial onchocerciasis prevalence in West Africa using B-MBG. Important environmental predictors of infection prevalence were identified and used in a model out-performing those without spatial random effects or environmental covariates. Results may be compared with recent <b>epidemiological</b> <b>mapping</b> efforts to find areas of persisting transmission. These methods may be extended to areas where data are sparse, and may be used to help inform the feasibility of elimination with current and novel tools...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human {{infection}} with Wuchereria bancrofti causes a disabling parasitic disease known as lymphatic filariasis, {{which is a}} major public health and socio-economic problem {{in many parts of}} the world. At the onset of the study, little was known of the distribution of filariasis and its current importance as a public health problem in Nepal. Methods: <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>mapping</b> was undertaken to determine the prevalence of infection by Wuchereria bancrofti in 37 districts of Nepal between July to December 2001. The study population above 15 years of age was selected, and the immunochromatographic test (ICT Filariasis) was used to screen for circulating filarial antigen (CFA). Results: The overall prevalence of lymphatic filariasis from a 4, 488 -sample population was 13 % and 33 / 37 districts were found to be endemic. On the basis of geographical data, the highest number of cases was found at altitudes between 500 – 700 m; however, a substantial number of infected individuals were found in the highly populated Kathmandu valley, at altitudes between 900 – 1, 500 metres where transmission appears to take place. Prevalence rates above 20 % were found in 11 districts (with the highest rate of 40 %), 6 – 19 % were found in 15 districts, and 0. 1 – 5 % were in 7 districts. Information on people's knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards filariasis was also collected by means of a structured questionnaire, which is presented and discussed in the study. Conclusions: This is the most extensive study of lymphatic filariasis undertaken to date in Nepal. The study indicates that the prevalence of infection is far greater than was previously reported and that lymphatic filariasis should be a much higher health priority than currently given...|$|R
40|$|Gold {{standard}} diagnosis using blood films or skin snips has dimished relevance as mass {{drug distribution}} programmes {{for control of}} filaria infections expand. The view of 'diagnosis' and its relevance {{at the individual level}} has changed, as it has been recognised that the spectrum of programmatic processes (mapping, mass drug interventions, monitoring and evaluation, and surveillance) require different approaches as different questions are asked at each stage. The feasibility and relevance of skin biopsy or blood film examination is challenged when mass drug distribution seeks to treat all eligibles in communities. The need to expand programmes rapicity by identifying the highest risk communities has seen the development of rapid assessment methods, such as rapid <b>epidemiological</b> <b>mapping</b> of onchocerciasis (REMO) and rapid epidemiological assessment (REA) for onchocerciasis, immunochromatographic test (ICT) -based mapping for lymphatic filariasis (LF), and Rapid Assessment Procedure for Loiasis (RAPLOA) for Loa, {{to reduce the risk of}} serious adverse events and to guide projects in high-risk communities. As programmes reduce the prevalence through mass drug distribution, more sensitive techniques are required to define endpoints, for LF in particular where the programmatic goat is elimination: for onchocerciasis, sensitive surveillance toots are required particularly in those areas where such risks of recrudescence are high. Whilst much progress has been made in the development and deployment of rapid methods, there are still specific needs for antigen detection in onchocerciasis, whilst standardisation of a panel of toots for LF with allow the definition of endpoint parameters so that countries can decide when mass drug administration (MDA) can be stopped and have a sensitive post-MDA surveillance system.
