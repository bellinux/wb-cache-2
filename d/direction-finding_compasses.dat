50|$|The Japanese 1st Air Fleet is {{conservatively}} {{estimated to}} have lost five aircraft during the first Darwin raid. Australian anti-aircraft gunners accounted for one Zero and one bomber while a second Zero was later found crash-landed on Melville Island. This last aircraft, which was still relatively intact, gave Allied intelligence officers their first opportunity to try to establish {{the basis of the}} Zero's phenomenal performance. A detailed examination of the aircraft established such crucial factors as maximum range and firepower and also highlighted a number of significant weaknesses such as the lack of fuel tank protection, pilot armour, and armoured glass. Equally significant was the discovery that the Japanese were using Swedish-designed cannons and American-designed <b>direction-finding</b> <b>compasses,</b> propellers and machine-guns. The Zero had already begun to look vulnerable.|$|E
