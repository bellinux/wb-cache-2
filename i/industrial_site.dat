5|$|Deptford's {{economic}} {{history has been}} strongly connected to the Dockyard - when the Dockyard was thriving, so Deptford thrived; with the docks now all closed, Deptford has declined economically. However, areas of Deptford are being gradually re-developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre. A large former <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> by the Thames called Convoys Wharf is scheduled for redeveloping into mixed use buildings. This will involve the construction of around 3,500 new homes and {{an extension of the}} town centre northwards towards the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Duchy of Lancaster {{sold the}} Crewe Hall {{buildings}} and the adjacent <b>industrial</b> <b>site,</b> which became Crewe Hall Enterprise Park. The Crewe Hall buildings remained empty after Wellcome moved out and were sold to a hotel developer in 1998; the hall became a 26-bedroom hotel the following year. Several additional buildings in a modern style were constructed {{in the 21st century}} to extend the accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Marc Isambard Brunel {{established}} the world's first mass production line at Portsmouth Block Mills making pulley blocks for rigging on the navy's ships. The first machines were installed in January 1803 {{and the final}} set for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. By {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the town had the largest <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> in the world with a workforce of 8000 and an annual budget of £570,000.|$|E

40|$|The future {{demand for}} <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> in the Netherlands: is {{employment}} a good predictor, Regional Studies. Popular forecasting models for long-term planning of <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> assume a strong linear relationship between employment and land use. New Dutch panel data for 1997 – 2008 {{were used to}} test this assumption. In a linear model, employment alone does not suffice to predict land use. Non-linear models show a relationship at municipal and <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> level, but not for regions. However, the relationship is strongly biased by unobserved heterogeneity. For planning purposes and prediction, additional explanatory variables are necessary to tackle this problem. The findings {{do not support the}} use of simple linear models for the planning of <b>industrial</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reuse the old <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> is an {{important}} way to adjust the structure of city, {{as well as a}} right way to preserve the industrial heritages. Four important reusing methods are analyzed, developing industrial heritage tourism on the site, changing the discarded industrial land into a beautiful landscape park, spreading cultural and creative art in the old <b>industrial</b> <b>sites,</b> retaining the <b>industrial</b> usage and attracting different small factories to enter in. Hope the different reusing methods can preserve the old <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> and revive the economy...|$|R
5|$|At {{a remote}} <b>industrial</b> <b>site,</b> Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and Jeremiah Smith (Roy Thinnes) are {{approached}} by the Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson). Mulder and Smith flee with both Scully and the Bounty Hunter in pursuit, eventually reaching a waterfront. Mulder sneaks {{up on the}} Bounty Hunter and stabs him in the neck with the alien stiletto. Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead Bounty Hunter. When she approaches the body, the Bounty Hunter wakes up and chokes her, demanding to know where Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she has no such knowledge.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
5|$|The City of Everett {{selected}} a straightaway track segment east of downtown as the preferred {{location of a}} multimodal train/bus station, to replace the existing Amtrak station at Bond Street, in 1993. The Everett City Council chose a two-block <b>industrial</b> <b>site</b> bordered by Pacific Avenue to the north in 1995, estimating a cost of $30 million and an opening in 1998. Everett Mayor Ed Hansen proposed adding two additional stories to the station building to house classrooms and space for career counseling services, inspired by a similar project in Oakland, California. The Sound Transit Board passed a resolution in February 1999 allowing the use of $14 million to begin work on the Everett Multimodal Facility, {{which was to be}} the terminus for Sounder commuter rail and Sound Transit Express bus service. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 13, 2000, allowing for construction on Everett Station to begin. Sound Transit began with the construction of the Pacific Avenue overpass, replacing an earlier at-grade crossing, that opened on November 14, 2001 at a cost of $20 million. The station building was designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership and built by Wilder Construction Company in 2000 and 2001.|$|E
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{has become}} a large concern for many {{companies}} {{with the rise of}} globalization. Oftentimes, companies are encouraged to communicate CSR externally, but not internally. This research focuses upon the internal communication of CSR, specifically how Human Resource (HR) professionals use electronic channels to communicate to employees. The scope of this research is focused solely upon HR professionals within Solvay’s French <b>industrial</b> <b>sites,</b> which produce chemicals. This research utilizes a case study to answer the research questions, which are how HR professionals electronically communicate CSR to employees, and what limitations may arise from this. Five HR Managers were interviewed from different French <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> This research found that electronic channels are used as a complementary method of communication within <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> HR professionals communicate to employees in two ways: directly or indirectly through an intermediary. To provide more clarity to the research problem, an electronic communication model was developed specifically for <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> This model provides a framework for how HR professionals communicate CSR to employees, along with the limitations of this form of communication within <b>industrial</b> <b>sites.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Local {{economic}} {{development is a}} much used tool for the regeneration of urban areas. Although the designation and effectiveness of local {{economic development}} policies has been studied extensively in existing literature, {{the question as to}} whether these policies are aimed at the areas that are most in need of these policies remains relatively understudied. This question has been answered using the case of <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> in the Netherlands. This particular type of urban area in the Netherlands has experienced problems with rapid urban area decline and has therefore been targeted by various area-based regeneration initiatives for many years. The economic performance is the main justification for the designation of <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> that are in greater need of regeneration. However, another pertinent and unanswered question is: are the <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> targeted for regeneration really the ones that underperform economically? (Multinomial) logistic regression analysis is used to answer this question. Differences in economic performance, measured by the growth in employment figures, the number of companies and property values, between <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> that are targeted for regeneration in two different rounds of regeneration initiatives and non-targeted sites are studied. The analysis shows that the differences in economic performance are negligible between these groups. It indicates that other criteria, such as political and strategic decision making influence policymakers’ decisions to target <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> for regeneration, thus making it at least doubtful that public money for the regeneration of <b>industrial</b> <b>sites</b> is being spent on what it is meant for...|$|R
