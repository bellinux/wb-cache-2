50|$|Monistic idealism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> consciousness, not matter, is {{the ground}} of all being. It is monist because it <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> {{there is only one}} type of thing in the {{universe}} and idealist because it <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> one thing to be consciousness.|$|R

The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and neutral monism, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{deterministic}} world-view <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> {{the history}} of the universe can be exhaustively represented as a progression of events following one after as cause and effect. The incompatibilist version of this <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no such thing}} as [...] "free will". Compatibilism, on the other hand, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> determinism is compatible with, or even necessary for, free will.|$|R

25|$|The Sma, who <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> Shmita {{nowadays}} {{is only a}} Rabbinic obligation, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the Biblical {{promise of}} bounty for those who observe the Shmita (Leviticus 25:20–22) only applies when the Biblical obligation is in effect, and hence that the Biblical promise of bounty is not in effect today. However, the Chazon Ish, who <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the Biblical obligation of Shmita observance remains in effect today, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the Biblical promise of bounty follows it and Divine bounty is promised to Jews living in the Land of Israel today, {{just as it was}} promised in ancient times. However, he <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> Jews should generally not demand miracles from Heaven and hence that one should not rely on this promise for one's sustenance, but should instead make appropriate arrangements and rely on permissible leniencies.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the case}} has not been {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

25|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between the brain and the mind– mind–body problem is one of the central issues in the history of philosophy– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically. There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. Dualism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the mind exists independently of the brain; materialism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena; and idealism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> only mental phenomena exist.|$|R

5000|$|Medieval realism {{developed}} out {{of debates}} over the problem of universals. Universals are terms or properties {{that can be applied}} to many things, such as [...] "red", [...] "beauty", [...] "five", or [...] "dog". Realism in this context, contrasted with conceptualism and nominalism, <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. Moderate Realism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist separately from the specific thing. Conceptualism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> universals do not [...] "exist" [...] at all but are no more than words (flatus vocis) that describe specific objects.|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 3rd century {{and into the}} 4th, it was held by some churchmen that Philip {{had been the first}} Christian emperor; he was {{described}} as such in Jerome's Chronicon (Chronicle), which was well known during the Middle Ages, and in Orosius' highly popular Historia Adversus Paganos (History Against the Pagans). Most scholars <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> these and other early accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica (Ecclesiastical History).|$|E

25|$|Within {{this broad}} definition, {{theories}} of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing {{development of an}} individual), or both. They can be holistic (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), idealist (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or nondual (<b>holding</b> <b>that</b> there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality).

5|$|Historians now <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command}} of João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E
5|$|I {{am willing}} to <b>hold</b> <b>that,</b> {{as a matter of}} law, a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent that}} it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E

40|$|The author {{identifies}} four {{conceptualizations of}} the relation between symptoms and disorders as utilized in diagnostic systems such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) : A constructivist perspective, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> disorders are conveniently grouped sets of symptoms; a diagnostic perspective, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> disorders are latent classes underlying the symptoms; a dimensional perspective, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> symptoms measure latent continua; and a causal systems perspective, which <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> disorders are causal networks consisting of symptoms and direct causal relations between them. Advantages and disadvantages of these conceptualizations are discussed. The author concludes that the psychometric analysis of diagnostic systems is not settled, and that these systems require deeper psychometric analysis than they currently receive...|$|R

5|$|I would <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> {{officers}} {{must have}} some level of particularized suspicion in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing one’s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E
5|$|In June 1915, Sir George Makgill, Secretary of the Anti-German Union, {{applied for}} {{permission}} from the High Court to issue quo warranto writs against Speyer and Sir Ernest Cassel, a German-born Privy Counsellor, requiring them to prove their right to <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> position. Makgill's claim was that the Act of Settlement 1701 prevented a person born outside Britain or its dominions from being a Privy Counsellor. In December 1915, Lord Chief Justice Lord Reading rejected the application {{on the grounds that}} the relevant sections of the Act of Settlement had been repealed by later legislation.|$|E
