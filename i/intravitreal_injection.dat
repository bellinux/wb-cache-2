The adverse events encountered with <b>intravitreal</b> <b>injections</b> of sirolimus were rare and scattered. The most commonly reported adverse event in this group was vitreous floaters. Other ocular adverse events included single instances of changed refraction resulting in blurred vision, post-injection subconjunctival hemorrhage, forehead rash (above the study eye), ocular pain and redness, and progression of pre-existing cataract and glaucoma that required combined cataract extraction and glaucoma surgery with Ahmed valve implantation in the study eye. The ocular pain, redness, and subconjunctival hemorrhage were all considered related to the injection procedure rather than sirolimus. No other ocular adverse event was considered related to either the injection procedure or the study drug. Systemic adverse events included one event each of upper respiratory infection, tooth abscess, and sciatic pain secondary to disc prolapse. No systemic adverse event was considered related to the study drug. All systemic and ocular adverse events in this group were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae.|$|R

Methods: Retrospective consecutive case series. Three eyes of three patients were studied. All patients were treated with <b>intravitreal</b> <b>injections</b> of bevacizumab for CNV associated with choroidal osteoma. Best-corrected visual acuity, central foveal thickness, tumor thickness on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and subretinal pigmentation around the CNV were evaluated. Results: The mean number of <b>intravitreal</b> <b>injections</b> of bevacizumab was 2. 0 (range 1 – 3). The mean follow-up time was 56. 0 months (range 25 – 99 months).
