5|$|In 2005, Lance Mackey {{became the}} first Yukon Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was {{repeated}} by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey {{became the first}} to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race,</b> a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20days, 8hours, and 29minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle {{became the first woman}} to win the race, in 10days, 22hours, and 57minutes. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled <b>dog</b> <b>race,</b> also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police {{attempted}} {{to crack down}} on illegal gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No.69, and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered unlicensed horse and <b>dog</b> <b>race</b> betting which led to the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main 1,000-mile sled <b>dog</b> <b>race,</b> the Yukon Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon Quest and the Yukon Quest 300. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250miles and thus known as the Quest 250.|$|E

40|$|This article commences {{with a brief}} {{overview}} of the history of <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> in South Africa. It provides a synopsis of South Africa’s current legal position on <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> and the betting thereon. The main question this article addresses is whether there is any policy reason why <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> and wagering should not be legalised and regulated. Furthermore, some comments are included discussing how such regulation should fit into the broader existing gambling regulatory framework should the legislature make the decision to legalise <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> and wagering. The article concludes with a discussion of the greyhound racing industry in Britain and the recent developments in that jurisdiction. The rationale for the choice of this jurisdiction as a comparison is that a successful greyhound racing industry has existed in Britain for decades. Yet, notwithstanding the successes of <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> in Britain, an independent review was commissioned to investigate the sport after two high-profile animal welfare incidents in 2006. In December 2007, Lord Donoughue of Ashton, on behalf of the British Greyhound Racing Board and the National Greyhound Racing Club, published a report with recommendations for change titled, Independent Review of the Greyhound Industry in Great Britain. Although the Donoughue Report focuses exclusively on greyhound racing in Britain, this article submits that the principles used in Britain could be useful for any and all types of <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> and could provide some useful guidelines for the decision concerning the possible legalisation and regulation of the South African <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> industry...|$|R
50|$|PAWS opposes <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> and {{is working}} against the entry of Greyhound racing in the Philippines. The profit-motivated {{industry}} of <b>dog</b> <b>racing</b> deprives <b>dogs</b> of normal social interaction, breeds and kills excessive numbers of dogs {{in the pursuit of}} faster animals, and forces dogs into a risky situation that often culminates in catastrophic injury.|$|R
5|$|The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a 135-mile (217km) {{race for}} mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest {{does not change}} {{locations}} and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed {{as an opportunity for}} young racers to experience a mid-distance sled <b>dog</b> <b>race.</b> They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest 300 is a 300-mile (483km) race {{along the}} regular Yukon Quest trail. It {{alternates}} starting locations {{along with the}} main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race</b> and the following year's Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including Fort Yukon Native Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic program {{remained}} {{similar to}} previous Winter Olympics, {{with only a}} few exceptions: neither skeleton nor military patrol events were held; curling, which had appeared in the first Winter Olympic Games, was a non-medal demonstration sport in 1932, as were a sled <b>dog</b> <b>race</b> and women's speed skating. Both men and women competed in these Games, although the only medal events women contested were the ladies' singles and pairs in figure skating. Warm weather forced officials to hold the four-man bobsleigh competition two days after the closing ceremonies, which had been conducted on February 13.|$|E

Seavey, who has run the Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race</b> several times, won the Yukon Quest in his rookie year and therefore also was named rookie of the year. Haliburton, Ontario musher Hank DeBruin won the 2011 Red Lantern Award by finishing the race in 13 days, 10 hours, and 54 minutes. For {{the first time in}} Yukon Quest history, more than one musher received the sportsmanship award. Following the 2011 race, Allen Moore, Brent Sass and Mike Ellis shared the honor. Ken Anderson, who reached Dawson City third, {{was the only one of}} the top three at that point to finish, and thus received the Dawson Award. Wasilla musher Kelley Griffin received the Spirit of the North award, and the Veterinarian's Choice award was given to Mike Ellis and his wife/handler Sue Ellis.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, a large park was {{built around the}} shellmound. The park {{included}} two dance pavilions, one of which stood atop the shellmound. A trotting park (the Oakland Trotting Park) was built nearby at the junction of the Berkeley Branch line with the mainline of the Southern Pacific.

25|$|The Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race</b> is {{an annual}} long-{{distance}} sled <b>dog</b> <b>race</b> run in early March from Settler's Bay to Nome, {{which takes place}} entirely in the US state of Alaska. Mushers {{and a team of}} 16 dogs, of which at least 5 must be on the towline at the finish line, cover the distance in 8–15 days or more. The Iditarod began in 1973 as an event to test the best sled dog mushers and teams but evolved into today's highly competitive race. Then a record, the second fastest winning time was recorded in 2016 by Dallas Seavey with a time of 8 days, 11 hours, 20 minutes, and 16 seconds. As of 2012, Dallas Seavey was also the youngest musher to win the race at the age of 25. In 2017, at the age of 57, Dallas's father, Mitch Seavey, is the oldest and fastest person ever to win the race, crossing the line in Nome in 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes and 13 seconds. Dallas finished second, two hours and 44 minutes behind.|$|E
25|$|The sled dog was {{the primary}} means of {{transportation}} and communication in subarctic communities around the world, and the race became both the last great hurrah and the most famous event {{in the history of}} mushing, before the first aircraft in the 1930s and then the snowmobile in the 1960s drove the dog sled almost into extinction. The resurgence of recreational mushing in Alaska since the 1970s {{is a direct result of}} the tremendous popularity of the Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race,</b> which honors the history of dog mushing.|$|E

25|$|The serum race helped {{spur the}} Kelly Act, which was {{signed into law}} on February 2. The bill allowed private {{aviation}} companies to bid on mail delivery contracts. Technology improved and within a decade, air mail routes were established in Alaska. The last mail delivery by private dog sled under contract took place in 1938, and the last U.S. Post Office dog sled route closed in 1963. Dog sledding remained popular in the rural interior but became nearly extinct when snowmobiles spread in the 1960s. Mushing was revitalized as a recreational sport in the 1970s with the immense popularity of the Iditarod Trail Sled <b>Dog</b> <b>Race.</b>|$|E
