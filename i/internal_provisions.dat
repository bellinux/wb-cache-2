40|$|As {{environmental}} law continues to mature in the second-generation since {{the enactment of}} several major federal environmental statutes in the 1970 s, two important implications from its current stage of development must be derived. First, second-generation judicial interpretation of these statutes no longer occurs in a vacuum: {{the applicability of the}} statute 2 ̆ 7 s <b>internal</b> <b>provisions</b> to a particular subset of factual circumstances has, in all likelihood, already been litigated. Second, and corollary to the first implication, the first-generation 2 ̆ 7 s establishment of precedent for interpreting each of a respective statute 2 ̆ 7 s provisions was a necessary prerequisite for what should now be the overriding purpose of the statute 2 ̆ 7 s second- generation maturation: the articulation of jurisdictional relationships amongst federal environmental statutes. Unless this second-generation maturation occurs, {{environmental law}} will not evolve into a comprehensive legal regime but will remain the same confusing morass of isolated and contradictory statutes that the first-generation of statutory interpretation necessarily laid the foundation to overcome. Recent judicial interpretation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) threatens to revert environmental law to its first-generation of development. This interpretation completely fails to address the CWA 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional relationship with other federal environmental statutes; it correspondingly also fails to address whether almost identical factual circumstances have already been fully litigated under federal environmental law. Regrettably, this recent litigation has granted legitimacy to a completely novel interpretation of the CWA. Thus, an area of environmental law that has been well settled for decades has been shattered: the first-generation of environmental law has begun again, threatening to stunt the development of the field in an endless feedback loop involving the interpretation of fragmented provisions of discrete environmental statutes as if each occupied completely independent fiefdoms. To understand how the CWA has recently been distorted, and to map the proper road for the second-generation of environmental law 2 ̆ 7 s development, it is first necessary to look through the near-distant mirror of the statute 2 ̆ 7 s infancy period...|$|E

40|$|The paper uses a {{procedure}} called {{data envelopment analysis}} (DEA) to compare internal against external (outsource) efficiency {{in the delivery of}} finance function activities. The approach allows a direct comparison between the in-house efficiency of UK small, medium and large companies in managing their accounting activities both with UK outsource contractors and also against the rather larger and more numerous contractors observed in Italy. The paper finds that, through comparative advantages, outsourcing presents a more efficient solution for the management of very small firm accounting than <b>internal</b> <b>provision.</b> Furthermore, there is evidence that substantial scale benefits continue to be available to outsource contractors, while inefficiency on <b>internal</b> <b>provision</b> is mainly technical. The paper concludes that outsourcing provision is likely to offer worthwhile savings to small firms, allowing them to shed competitive weaknesses and operate at efficient or best practice levels.

On-orbit servicing is a clear candidate {{for the application of}} autonomous rendezvous and docking mechanisms. However, during the last three decades most of the trials took place combining extravehicular activities (EVAs) with telemanipulated robotic arms. The European Space Agency (ESA) considers that grasping and refuelling are promising near-mid-term capabilities that could be performed by servicing spacecraft. Minimal add-ons on spacecraft to enhance their serviceability may protect them for a changing future in which satellite servicing may become mainstream. ESA aims to conceive and promote standard refuelling provisions that can be installed in present and future European commercial geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite platforms and scientific spacecraft. For this purpose ESA has started the ASSIST activity addressing the analysis, design and validation of <b>internal</b> <b>provisions</b> (such as modifications to fuel, gas, electrical and data architecture to allow servicing) and external provisions (such as integrated berthing fixtures with peripheral electrical, gas, liquid connectors, leak check systems and corresponding optical and radio markers for cooperative rendezvous and docking). This refuelling approach is being agreed with European industry (OHB, Thales Alenia Space) and expected to be consolidated with European commercial operators as a first step to become an international standard; this approach is also being considered for on-orbit servicing spacecraft, such as the SpaceTug, by Airbus DS. This paper describes in detail the operational means, structure, geometry and accommodation of the system. Internal and external provisions will be designed with the minimum possible impact on the current architecture of GEO satellites without introducing additional risks in the development and commissioning of the satellite. Endeffector and berthing fixtures are being designed in the range of few kilos and linear dimensions around 15 cm. A central mechanical part is expected to perform first a soft docking followed by a motorized retraction ending during a hard docking phase using aligning pins. Mating and de-mating will be exhaustively analysed to ensure robustness of operations. Leakage-free valves would allow for the transfer of fuel to the serviced spacecraft. The validation of the ASSIST system through dedicated environmental tests in a vacuum chamber together with dynamic testing using an air-bearing table will allow for the demonstration of concept feasibility and its suitability for becoming a standard of the on-orbit space industry...|$|E
40|$|Ömsesidiga överenskommelser (eng. mutual {{agreement}} procedures) återfinns huvudsakligen i artikel 25 OECD:s modellavtal. Syftet med sådana överenskommelser är att undvika internationell dubbelbeskattning. Överenskommelserna kan antingen utgöra ett rättsmedel, som är ett alternativ till domstolsförfarande, eller verka som ett medel för att få skatteavtalen att fungera bättre mellan de avtalsslutande staterna. De rättsliga svårigheter som uppkommer i samband med överenskommelserna beror huvudsakligen på att överenskommelserna utgör en internationellt, av OECD, konstruerad företeelse som ska anpassas till och tillämpas på ett nationellt, redan befintligt regelsystem. Det kan härmed uppkomma spänningar och motsättningar mellan olika bestämmelser. Det övergripande syftet med denna studie är att kartlägga och utvärdera en internationellt konstruerad företeelse, dvs. ömsesidiga överenskommelser, för att undersöka om ändamålet med sådana överenskommelser uppfylls inom ramen för det svenska regelsystemet. Studien företas inom rättsområdet internationell skatterätt, men har emellertid en interdisciplinär ansats. Härav analyseras även bestämmelser inom folkrätt, konstitutionell rätt, förvaltningsprocessrätt, allmän förvaltningsrätt och sekretess. The {{focal point of}} this study is {{mutual agreement}} procedures, which are found in tax treaties, and derived from Art. 25 OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC). The overall purpose of the mutual agreements is to avoid international double taxation. The agreements can either constitute an alternative to court proceedings, or constitute a means for improving the functioning of tax treaties. Provisions regarding mutual agreements can be found, in various forms, in all Swedish tax treaties. Since Sweden is a dualistic state tax treaties are incorporated into the Swedish legal system by legislation. This means that the provisions regarding mutual agreements are incorporated into Swedish legislation. Legal difficulties that arise regarding the agreements are mainly {{due to the fact that}} mutual agreement procedures constitute an internationally, by the OECD, constructed phenomenon, which is to be applied on a nationally, already existing, legal system. It may hereby occur tensions and conflicts between different provisions. The overall aim {{of this study is}} to identify and evaluate mutual agreements from a Swedish perspective. This includes identifying a relatively unexplored area, i. e. mutual agreements and their place within the Swedish legal system. In order to meet the overall objective, three research tasks are formulated. First, which <b>internal</b> <b>provisions</b> apply to mutual agreements, and how are they to be applied? Secondly, it is examined if the Swedish legal system, regarding mutual agreements, is consistent from three evaluation criteria: the constitutional principles of separation of powers and legal competence, legal certainty aspects, and the provisions of the Vienna Convention of the Law on treaties (VCLT). If there are any inconsistences in the legal system, may these be solved? Thirdly, it is studied if the Swedish legal system, regarding mutual agreements, provides for fulfillment of the purpose of mutual agreements or if there are any legal obstacles to this. The thesis is carried out in the field of tax law. However, the study has an interdisciplinary approach, which means that aspects of other areas of law are considered, such as international law, constitutional law, administrative judicial procedural law, administrative law, and secrecy...|$|E
40|$|The study elaborates {{a problem}} of {{relation}} of the ILO conventions to the internal labour law in Poland having in view general transformations in -the modern world resulting in abandoning extreme dualistic ideas in favor of concepts which are intermediate between monism and dualism in solving the international and internal law relation dilemma. Lack of an explicit regulation of that question in the Polish constitution {{and a lack of}} labour code provisions on its relation to the international labour laws as well as a particularly compound nature of problems involved render a discussional and issue stating character of this study. A comparison of basic principles of labour law in Poland with relevantly ordered conventions of the ILO proves a high degree of their interference. The conventions are also analogous to the Polish law within the framework of respective principles. Since the basic principles of internal law are developed not only internally but also externally, outside of State, in the ILO conventions, the latter should perform, among others, functions analogous to those of basic principles of the internal labour law. A substantial number of conventions corresponding to some of those principles suggests a high degree of detailed regulation provided. In fact most of these conventions concern details which can find more circumstantial regulation in international law than it is done in internal labour law, especially in acts of legislation: A comparison of specific international and <b>internal</b> <b>provisions</b> relating to the same question can usually indicate that in the scope of their wording they are almost not different, especially in the respect of a possibility of their application in internal law. They are of a self-executing character which can be indirectly proved by the fact that some labour codes prescribe expressis verbis applying the ILO conventions in specific individual matters not being regulated by internal law. Wording of certain provisions of the ILO conventions can also suggest adopting a principle of laying down certain rights (or duties) directly for the benefit of employees (or employers) and of describing situations in which rights or obligations formulated in the convention are to be regulated in internal law or by other acts of domestic authorities or other subjects of internal law. Another legal and dogmatic argument for the proprio vigore effectiveness of a substantial part of the ILO conventions in the internal relations is also the fact of their en bloc' ratification by the special ratifying act of the Diet. It can be also proved by way of entering into an agreement adopted in Poland, ratification procedures and, especially a „qualified" mode provided for the ILO conventions. It is implied that internal law has to be brought to conform to the ILO regulations and conformity to socio-political conditions has to be examined before and not after ratification. Some opinions expressed in the doctrine of labour law ought to be rediscussed as it seems, in light of these findings; it concerns those views Which assume that provisions of the ILO conventions must be, as a rule, substantiated in internal laws. It has to be therefore postulated to regulate a relation of international to internal law in the Polish constitution. The relation of the ILO conventions to internal labour law can be additionally regulated in labour code, provided the participation of the Diet in the convention ratification process.

In the background the framework creates a Linux container and installs the provisioning and governance agents on it (more details about this process are given in Section 5). In general, the agents expose the provisioning APIs, which are activated and available at that point. Afterwards, a developer provides a configuration model for the gateway. In this example the gateway is configured to be deployed on a specific host by setting the “host address". In case it is not set the framework uses the deployment class to determine the gateway placement.

40|$|We offer {{a theory}} {{explaining}} how alliances as international security regimes reduce military conflict between member-states through their <b>internal</b> <b>provision</b> of information concerning national military capabilities. Bargaining models of war {{have shown that}} a lack of information about relative military capabilities functions as an important cause of war. We argue that alliances provide such information to internal participants, and greater knowledge within the alliance about member-state military capabilities reduces certain informational problems that could potentially lead to war. This internal information effect, however, is a conditional one. We posit that the information provided within the alliance matters most for dyads at or near power parity: the cases where states are most uncertain about who would prevail if a military conflict did emerge. In power preponderant dyads where the outcome of a potential military conflict is relatively certain, the internal information provided by military alliances becomes less important.
