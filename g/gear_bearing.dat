50|$|Neglecting {{clearance}} {{and assuming}} perfect accuracy, the engagement of bearing gears {{is aimed at}} maximum rolling with minimum sliding friction of conjugated profiles in movement. End rollers limit the gears radial shift at their contact points {{so that when the}} gears are engaged, slip-free rolling motion of their conjugated pairs is achieved. Adjacent end faces of teeth and rollers limit the axial shift of conjugated bearing gears in plane-parallel motion. In such a way, using bearing gears as sun, ring and more than two satellites uniformly distributed among them the entire <b>gear</b> <b>bearing</b> is arranged, and carrier may be used instead of ring or sun gearwheels, or it may act as a frame unit and transfer rotation from the satellites, whereas limitation of carrier degrees of freedom would form redundant constraints or serve as an additional basis for force distribution in the mechanism. In case less than three bearing satellite gearwheels are involved, at least axles of movable sun and/or of ring bearing gearwheels should be fixed relative to housing parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{sequence}} of the first episode opens with a close-up {{of the sun and}} the astrolabe surrounding it. Relief details are visible on the astrolabe, showing a volcano destroying a city while a dragon watches on and several people escape in a boat, a reference to the Doom of Valyria. The camera then pans to a wide-shot of Westeros and Essos before zooming in on the city of King's Landing, in particular the sigil of House Baratheon on {{what appears to be a}} large gear in the middle of the city. The gear begins turning, moving other cogs, and then three-dimensional buildings start rising out of the ground, such as the Red Keep and the Great Sept of Baelor. Once the city is assembled, the camera moves north across Westeros to Winterfell, which similarly rises out of the ground while a <b>gear</b> <b>bearing</b> the sigil of House Stark rotates. The camera pays particular attention to the godswood of Winterfell and its heart tree as it rises out of the ground before panning up to the sun and astrolabe. There is then another close-up of the detail on the astrolabe, this time showing the Stark direwolf, Lannister lion and Baratheon stag engaging the Targaryen dragon in combat, a reference to Robert's Rebellion. The camera returns to Winterfell and then pans north to the Wall, where more gears start turning and Castle Black emerges from the ground, while the pulley lift emerges from the face of the Wall. The camera pulls all the way back to King's Landing before moving across the Narrow Sea to the Free City of Pentos, which similarly emerges from the ground while gears rotate.The title sequence ends with a return to the relief detail of the astrolabe, now showing the animals representing the various noble houses of Westeros bowing to the triumphant Baratheon stag. The Game of Thrones logo then appears over the astrolabe, with the heads of a dragon, wolf, lion, and stag emerging from the side of the logo.|$|E
40|$|Machinery {{condition}} monitoring {{has become one}} of the essential components in the industry due to the ability of providing insight to the machine condition during operation as well as enhancing productivity and increasing machine reliability. This paper provides a review on using acoustic emission (AE) technique combined with artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the field of machinery {{condition monitoring}} and fault diagnosis.
