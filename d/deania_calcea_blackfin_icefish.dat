40|$|Abstract. Most deep-water chondrichthyans {{occurring}} offmainland Portugal are distributedworldwide. There aremany {{closely related}} species with similar morphology, {{and the lack of}} diagnostic characters that unambiguously allow species discrimination has led to extensive identification problems. Here, DNA barcodes were used to evaluate the suitability of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) to identify deep-water chondrichthyans and to further contribute to the worldwidemolecular databases currently in use. The sample was composed of 40 individuals from the families Chimaeridae, Centrophoridae, Somniosidae, Etmopteridae, Oxynotidae, Dalatiidae, Scyliorhinidae, Mitsukurinidae, Chlamydoselachidae and Hexan-chidae. COI proved to be adequate for species identification, with almost all putative species recovered as well supported monophyletic clades, with low intraspecific variation. Sequence matches against the BOLD database provided evidence for the existence of identification problems particularly within the generaHydrolagus,Galeus and Centrophorus. Present results suggest that three different Centrophorus species occur off the Portuguese mainland, C. squamosus, C. granulosus and C. uyato. The sample also included an albino <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea</b> and a C. squamosus specimen without dermal denticles. This study updates the current knowledge on diversity and distribution of deep-water chondrichthyans occurring along the Portuguese coast, and provides an essential tool for species identification and consistency of taxonomic designations worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} a new Serravallian (Middle Miocene) {{locality}} from the Southeastern Spain has yielded a shark assemblage characterized by microremains of at least seven taxa (<b>Deania</b> <b>calcea,</b> †Isistius triangulus, †Squaliolus cf. S. schaubi, †Paraetmopterus sp., Pristiophorus sp., Scyliorhinus sp. and a cf. Squaliformes indet) of three different orders (Squaliformes, Pristiophoriformes and Carcharhiniformes). In addition, associated macroremains have also been found, including teeth of †Cosmopolitodus hastalis, Isurus sp., Hemipristis serra, Odontaspis sp., Carcharhinus spp. and †Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon. The assemblage contains taxa with disparate environmental preferences including not only neritic and epipelagic sharks but also an important number of meso and bathypelagic representatives. The migration of deep water taxa toshallower waters through submarine canyons/coastal upwelling is proposed as the most plausible cause for explaining the origin of such assemblage. Interestingly, {{the composition of the}} deep-water taxa here reported contrast with the chondrichthyans assemblages from the Pliocene and extant Mediterranean communities. This entails a complex biogeographic history, where the Messinian salinity crisis strongly affected the posterior evolution of the Mediterranean ecosystems but some other factors, such us the existence of anoxic events during the Quaternary, could have also played an important role...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} in situ observations on nesting by the Scotia Sea (or <b>blackfin)</b> <b>icefish</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus (Lönnberg) {{that constitute the}} first substantive evidence of egg brooding and parental care by species of the family Channichthyidae. At Boutetoya Island six fish, all apparently male, were observed guarding egg nests at depths of 141 – 148 m during an ROV deployment. Eggs were laid as aggregated, round masses (~ 20 – 25 cm diameter) in shallow, circular depressions (~ 1 -m diameter, ~ 20 -cm depth) that were probably excavated by the parent(s) to protect the nests. The fish guardians remained tenaciously {{in contact with the}} eggs despite disturbances caused by the ROV, reacting to this threat with stress and defense behaviors.

40|$|Life-history {{parameters}} of <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea</b> and <b>Deania</b> quadrispinosa suggested that their productivity was very low. Maturity (L T 50) occurs at c. 80 % of maximum observed total lengths (L T) for both species and sexes. A {{large proportion of}} mature females were neither pre-ovulatory nor pregnant, and the reproductive cycle included a distinct resting phase after pregnancy. For D. calcea, mean ovarian fecundity was 12 and maximum observed litter size was 10 (average of six); D. quadrispinosa averaged 17 pups per litter. Birth L T was 28 - 33 cm for D. calcea and 23 - 25 cm for D. quadrispinosa. The male and female reproductive cycles were aseasonal, and consequently, {{the length of the}} reproductive cycle could not be determined. Preliminary ageing data from dorsal-spine growth bands suggested that female D. calcea lived to 31 - 36 years and males to 24 - 32 years. The L T -at-age data using external bands on the spines showed maturity occurring at 15 · 5 years (males) and 21 · 5 years (females), whereas banding on the internal dentine indicated maturity at 10 · 5 and 17 · 5 years for males and females. Thus, a female lifetime of 31 - 36 years allowed for a maximum of 7 litters if a 2 year cycle is assumed or only five litters with a 3 year cycle, resulting in a lifetime fecundity of only 42 pups (2 year cycle) or even lower (3 year cycle). <br /...|$|R
40|$|Squaliforme {{sharks are}} a common but {{relatively}} vulnerable bycatch in many deep water fisheries. Eleven species of squaliforme shark are commonly caught at depths of 200 – 1200 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and their diversity suggests they might occupy different niches. The diets of 133 <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea</b> and 295 Squalus acanthias were determined from examination of stomach contents. The diet of D. calcea was characterised by mesopelagic fishes, and S. acanthias by benthic to pelagic fishes, but was more adaptive and included likely scavenging. Multivariate analyses found the most important predictors of diet variability in S. acanthias were year, bottom temperature, longitude, and fish weight. The diet of the nine other commonly caught squaliforme sharks was reviewed, and the spatial and depth distribution of all species on Chatham Rise described from research bottom trawl survey catches. The eleven species had {{a variety of different}} diets, and depth and location preferences, consistent with niche separation to reduce interspecific competition. Four trophic groups were identified, characterised by: mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroselachus crepidater, D. calcea, and Etmopterus lucifer); mesopelagic and benthopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroscymnus owstoni, Etmopterus baxteri); demersal and benthic fishes (Centrophorus squamosus, Dalatias licha, Proscymnodon plunketi); and a generalist diet of fishes and invertebrates (S. acanthias).

40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (36 %), bird beak dogfish <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea</b> (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, Brosme brosme (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark Etmopterus princeps. Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters.

40|$|Deep-water sharks exhibit species-specific {{reproductive}} strategies, {{which include}} segregation by sex, size and reproductive stage. However, {{due to the}} wide spatial distribution of most species, available information, usually collected at a regional scale, is usually not adequate to infer species reproductive spatial dynamics. This study draws together information {{on the distribution of}} reproductive stages of three species of squaliform sharks: Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis (Somniosidae), leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (Centrophoridae) and birdbeak dogfish <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea</b> (Centrophoridae), gathering data from several geographical areas from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. For each species we analysed the sex ratio and the spatial patterns of reproductive stages within regions, considering the influence of geographical area, depth, season, temperature and salinity. The combination of statistical methods used in this study successfully identified a number of life history patterns which reflect different use of habitats by sex and life cycle stage. Pregnant females of the three species are spatially segregated, inhabiting shallower and/or warmer waters. In the case of the leafscale gulper shark this segregation might be associated with large scale migrations. In contrast, in Portuguese dogfish all adult maturity stages occur in the same geographical area. Pregnant female birdbeak dogfish were rare in all samples. Larger immature specimens of all the three species distribute deeper than the remaining maturity stages in most of the regions analysed. Mature males of leafscale gulper shark and birdbeak dogfish were more broadly distributed than mature females, supporting the possibility of sex-biased dispersal. Neonates and small sized specimens were scarce in the Northeast Atlantic potentially explained by their concentration in nurseries, and/or by gear selectivity. Management measures will benefit from considering the geographic scale of demographic variation between species. However, standardized collaborative approaches will be needed for comprehensive assessment. Publicado...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} two superficially similar species of deep sea sharks, Centroselachus crepidater and <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea,</b> {{with the purpose}} of better understanding the drivers of differentiation and subsequent biodiversity in the deep sea. To achieve this four sample sites were used to coarsely represent the Atlantic and Pacific distribution of each species, with the genomes of each individual being sampled using a ddRADseq protocol. From these genome samples thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and bioinformatically separated into neutral and outlier (under possible selective forces) marker sets which were then investigated for patterns of population genetic structure and adaptive function. Despite comparable life history traits and overlapping sample sites, the two species showed differing patterns of differentiation across their range. In the neutral loci, C. crepidater showed significant differentiation between the Pacific and Atlantic, and homogeneity in the Atlantic. D. calcea showed effective panmixia across all sample sites. In the outlier loci, C. crepidater again showed Atlantic-Pacific differentiation, but also a split between the Rockall Trough and the Mid Atlantic Ridge. D. calcea also showed outlier differentiation between the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as significant divergence between two spatially similar sample sites in the Rockall Trough. Two possible proteins were identified linked to adaptive function, which were not insightful in themselves, but provide a starting point for future study. These data combined with previous work on this deep sea taxon suggest that there is variation in patterns of differentiation between closely related species. However, common to all species so far studied are apparent high levels of vagility and dispersive capacity across global ranges. This provides further evidence that geographical barriers to dispersal are of lesser importance in determining genetic structure in deep sea basins, whilst isolation by distance and diversification along environmental clines likely play a more predominant role. ...|$|R
40|$|Shark fin, {{used as a}} food, is a {{rich source}} of glycosaminoglyans (GAGs), acidic polysaccharides having {{important}} biological activities, suggesting their nutraceutical and pharmaceutical application. A comprehensive survey of GAGs derived from the fin was performed on 11 elasmobranchs, including several deep sea sharks. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were found in Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Scyliorhinus torazame, <b>Deania</b> <b>calcea,</b> Chlamydoselachus anguineus, Mitsukurina owatoni, Mustelus griseus and Dasyatis akajei, respectively. CS was only found from Chimaera phantasma, Dalatias licha, and Odontaspis ferox, respectively. Characteristic disaccharide units of most of the CS were comprised of C- and D-type units. Interestingly, substantial amount of CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) was found in the dried fin (without skin and cartilage) of Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca. 1 H-NMR analysis showed that the composition of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and iduronic acid (IdoA) in shark CS/DS was 41. 2 % and 58. 8 % (Isurus oxyrinchus), 36. 1 % and 63. 9 % (Prionace glauca), respectively. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of this CS/DS consisted of E-, B- and D-type units. Shark CS/DS stimulated neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons at a similar level as DS derived from invertebrate species. Midkine and pleiotrophin interact strongly with CS/DS from Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca, affording Kd values of 1. 07 nM, 6. 25 nM and 1. 70 nM, 1. 88 nM, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the IdoA-rich domain of CS/DS is required for neurite outgrowth activity. A detailed examination of oligosaccharide residues, produced by chondroitinase ACII digestion, suggested that the IdoA and B-type units as well as A- and C-type units were found in clusters in shark CS/DS. In addition, it was discovered that the contents of B-type units in these IdoA-rich domain increased in a length dependent manner, while C- and D-type units were located particularly in the immediate vicinity of the IdoA-rich domain...|$|R

Also {{a population of}} P. decipiens (s. l.) from Chaenocephalus aceratus, the <b>blackfin</b> <b>icefish,</b> from Antarctica and another from Osmerus eperlanus, the European smelt, from Germany {{were included in the}} study. The first (ITS- 1) and second (ITS- 2) internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified by PCR from individual nematodes and analysed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), followed by selective sequencing. While no variation in single-stranded ITS- 1 and ITS- 2 profiles was detected among samples representing each of the species or populations (with the exception of slight microheterogeneity), SSCP analysis of the ITS- 2 amplicons allowed the unequivocal differentiation of all of the 5 sibling species of P. decipiens (s. l.) examined, which was supported by sequence differences in ITS rDNA. Samples representing the P. decipiens (s. l.) population from O. eperlanus had the same SSCP profile as those of P. decipiens (s. s.), which was supported by a lack of nucleotide difference in the ITS between them, suggesting that the former represented P. decipiens (s. s.). Based on SSCP results and ITS sequence data, P. decipiens (s. l.) from C. aceratus was genetically most distinct with respect to all other members of Pseudoterranova examined, which indicated that it may represent P. decipiens E (based on geographical origin) or a distinct species. These findings and the molecular approach taken should have important implications for studying the life-cycles, transmission patterns, epidemiology and population genetics of these anisakid nematodes, and the diagnosis of their infections...|$|R
40|$|Mastigoteuthid squids are ecologically important, being prey to many apex predators, yet the {{diversity}} and systematics of the family remain poorly understood. Delicate by nature, they are often damaged during capture; {{this has led to}} a controversial and unstable taxonomy for this family. Recent reviews have accepted one or two genera, and eight to 17 species. A complete taxonomic review of the New Zealand mastigoteuthids is undertaken here first time. A morphological revision of New Zealand material was completed to identify and describe locally occurring species, and to re-evaluate the status of the genera in this family. Morphological examinations focused on both internal and external anatomy. A set of morphological characters have been identified to distinguish five genera: Mastigoteuthis [Mt. ], Idioteuthis, Mastigopsis [Mp. ], Echinoteuthis, and Magnoteuthis [Mg. ]. Eight species were identified: Mt. dentata, Mt. psychrophila, Mt. sp. X, Mt. sp. Y, I. cordiformis, Mp. hjorti, Mg. sp. nov., and E. famelica. The Mastigoteuthidae now appears to be second most diverse squid family in New Zealand waters. Three mitochondrial genes (16 S rRNA, 12 S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI]) were analysed for eight different species, in order to assess the utility of DNA barcodes to differentiate between species and to test the morphological hypothesis for the division of the five genera. Genetic evidence was found that supports Mg. sp. nov. as a distinct species that has been previously misidentified as the morphologically similar species Mg. magna. Each species analysed herein exhibited unique mitochondrial DNA haplotypes for all genes, and the morphological distinction between the genera was strongly supported using a combined phylogeny with all genes. However, I. cordiformis grouped with the chiroteuthids. Of the three genes examined, the DNA barcode region shows the greatest divergence between species and should be used in future systematic work on the Mastigoteuthidae. Because most mastigoteuthid specimens are badly damaged, integrative taxonomy is especially important for this family. Unfortunately, most specimens are formalin fixed, rendering DNA extraction difficult or impossible. Therefore, some preliminary tests were conducted on DNA from formalin-fixed museum specimens. Two sequences were recovered out of eight specimens tested using a silica-gel column-based extraction, with critical-point-dried tissue and a DNA purification protocol. The third sequence was recovered using an alkaline lysis extraction, with non-critical-point-dried tissue and without DNA purification. The sequences that were recovered showed a close relationship between Mt. agassizii, Mt. dentata, and Mt. sp. X. Idioteuthis cordiformis is the largest mastigoteuthid squid species and may currently be facing the potential of a local extinction in New Zealand; however, its ecology has not been previously studied. Therefore, stable isotopes 15 N and 13 C were analysed to find the trophic position and the source of carbon, respectively, and gut contents were examined using DNA barcoding. Stable isotopes revealed a correlation between δ 15 N and δ 13 C values, and I. cordiformis δ 15 N indicated that it occupies a high trophic position. Morphological analysis was not successful in identifying prey items below class, while DNA barcoding was able to identify two prey species: snapper (Lutjanus sp.), and birdbeak dogfish (<b>Deania</b> <b>calcea).</b> Although a review of the systematics of the New Zealand Mastigoteuthidae has been completed, a full review of this family is still required; an integrative taxonomic approach will be essential because there is often low interspecific and high intraspecific morphological variation. This will require continued collection efforts for new specimens, along with further research into DNA extraction from formalin-fixed tissue. In addition, future studies should also focus on the dietary habits and trophic position of mastigoteuthids in order to better understand their ecological importance...|$|R
