40|$|Many helium mass {{spectrometer}} leak detectors at KSC employ sampling systems that feature hand held sniffer probes. Authors of general leakage-testing literature recommend sniffer probes for leak location {{but not for}} quantitative leakage measurement. Their use in the latter application at KSC involves assumptions that may be subtle. The purpose of the research effort reported herein was to establish the significance of indicated leak rates displayed by sniffer-probe equipped leak detectors and {{to determine whether the}} use of alternative hardware or testing procedures may reduce the uncertainty of leakage measurements made with them. The report classifies probe-type sampling systems for <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> according to their internal plumbing (direct or branched), presents a basic analysis of the fluid dynamics in the sampling system in the branched-conduit case, describes the usual test method for measuring the internal supply-to-sample flowrate ratio (a. k. a permeation ratio), and describes a concept for a sponge-tipped probe whose external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio promises to be lower than that of a simple-ended probe. One conclusion is that the main source of uncertainty in the use of probe-type sampling systems for leakage measurement is uncertainty in the external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio. In contrast, the present method for measuring the internal supply-to-sample flowrate ratio is quantitative and satisfactory. The implication is that probes of lower external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio must be developed before this uncertainty may be reduced significantly...|$|E

40|$|Improvements in vacuum {{science and}} {{technology}} have triggered its application to wide areas of knowledge and it now {{plays an important role}} in many different industrial and research environments. The increasing use of elaborate and well designed vacuum systems leads to the need for well-trained staff and engineers in this area. The education and training of researchers and technicians by actual practice in laboratories has importance and significance in a field like vacuum {{science and technology}}. This is of particular importance for undergraduate and graduate student education, given the limited time available for teaching those curricula. It is very important for students’ education and training that direct quantitative measurements can be obtained during the experimental work, rather than just the simple operation of vacuum systems and qualitative analysis. Simple experiments, allowing students to perform direct measurements of the characteristics of different vacuum components and material properties, are thus important. We will describe simple experiments intended for didactic laboratory vacuum classes of undergraduate courses, where actual measurements are performed and compared with the values tabulated. These experiments are intended for five to six times 4 -h laboratory classes of an introductory vacuum course for undergraduate students majoring in Physics, Physics Engineering and Material Sciences. Small high vacuum systems are used with a rough vacuum gauge at both the high-vacuum chamber and mechanical pump inlet. This allows the monitoring of the pressure in the vacuum chamber during the roughing procedure and after the high-vacuum valve is closed. <b>Helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> have become common in both research and industrial environments. They have changed from luxury equipment, requiring expert handling, to economic, reliable and powerful monitoring instruments, which are relatively easy to use.

40|$|Abstract. A very {{sensitive}} <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> was utilized {{to measure the}} helium liberated from groups of zircons extracted from six deep granite cores. The observed low differential loss of gaseous helium down to 2900 m (197 °C) in these ancient Precambrian rocks is easily attributable to the greater diffusion of He at higher temperatures rather than losses due to corrosion of the zircons. This fact strongly suggests that deep granite burial should be a very safe corrosion—resistant containment procedure for long—term waste encapsulation.

40|$|The {{procedure}} is as follows: (1) Firmly bar clamp the box together in all directions. When all directions have been secured, tack weld each outside seam {{of the box}} in 4 or 5 places along it's length. Remove clamps and proceed to weld all outside seams. Care should be taken that the maximum weld cross section does not exceed 1 / 16 -inch x 1 / 16 -inch. (2) To help stabilize the metal as it cools, we will install all slot plugs, (MC- 223665), and one side cover plate, (MD- 223637). Inside welds for this side plate will be made thru the opposite side flange. Weld cross sections should be held to a 1 / 16 -inch maximum depth and width. (3) Weld {{the inside of the}} end plates, (MD- 224535), using the weld relief as filler material. After the box has cooled, weld the top plate (ME- 2244533) to the side flange, (ME- 224536) and then to the bottom plate (ME- 223534). (4) Repeat this procedure for the opposite side.

40|$|Our {{efforts have}} been {{directed}} to the solution of problems concerned in the manu-facture of good ceramic-to-metal brazes. An essential objective of this project is the fabrication of a magnetron having all-ceramic insulation, in order that the metal may be made as nearly gas-free as possible by high temperature processing. The titanium hydride process was selected as having the maximum advantage, at least for experi-mental work, and for several months gave eminently satisfactory results. More recently we have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} make a good window seal that will withstand our test pressure of 110 lbs/inch 2 and will test vacuum-tight on the <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detector.</b> Since the seal is made {{on the edge of a}} circular piece of aluminum oxide 0. 080 inch thick and 2. 500 inches in diameter, nondestructive examination is not possible. Although superficial examination always shows good solder flow through the seal area, very small leaks appear at one or more points along the periphery. Stripping the metal away from the ceramic usually shows a poor bond. In the course of experimentation about sixteen such seals have been made in the search for the culprit factors. Occasional test seals appear to be sound and the indica-tions are that a temperature well in excess of the melting point of the BT (Cu-Ag eutec-tic) solder used, must be attained. We have found that it is possible to have titanium hydride which does not behave well; that is, wetting of the surface is sporadic and takes place very slowly. Other factors of importance are the kind of film of hydride laid on the surface, whether too thick or too thin; the particle size of the hydride, which affects its quality as a paint; and finally, the handling of the completed and dry film. Among the test seals made in this period was a mockup window made entirely from kovar and welded to a kovar baseplate fitted for attachment to the tube processing vacuum system. Although the seal had a small leak, it successfully withstood the fol-lowing processing schedule...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the {{integrity}} of gas volumes is {{of interest to the}} stockpile surveillance community. Specifically, the leak detection of noble gases, at relevant concentration ranges and distinguished from other chemical species that may be simultaneously present, is particularly challenging. Aside from the laboratory-based method of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), where samples may be collected by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) or cryofocusing, the other major approaches for gas-phase detection employ lasers typically operating in the mid-infrared wavelength region. While mass spectrometry can readily detect noble gases - the <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> is an obvious example - laser-based methods such as infrared (IR) or Raman spectroscopy are completely insensitive to them as their monatomic nature precludes a non-zero dipole moment or changes in polarizability upon excitation. Therefore, noble gases can only be detected by one of two methods: (1) atomic emission spectroscopies which require the generation of plasmas through laser-induced breakdown, electrical arcing, or similar means; (2) non-spectroscopic methods which measure one or more physical properties (e. g., mass, thermal conductivity, density). In this report, we present our progress during Fiscal Year 2011 (FY 11) in the research and development of a non-spectroscopic method for noble gas detection. During Fiscal Year 2010 (FY 10), we demonstrated via proof-of-concept experiments that the combination of thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and coating-free damped resonance detection (CFDRD) using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) could provide selective sensing of these inert species. Since the MEMS-based TCD technology was directly adapted from a brassboard prototype commissioned by a previous chemical sensing project, FY 11 efforts focused on advancing the state of the newer CFDRD method. This work, guided by observations previously reported in the open literature, has not only resulted in a substantially measureable increase in selectivity but has also revealed a potential method for mitigating or eliminating thermal drift that does not require a secondary reference sensor. The design of an apparatus to test this drift compensation scheme will be described. We will conclude this report with a discussion of planned efforts in Fiscal Year 2012 (FY 12) ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{promising}} applications of metal/ceramic joining is in biomedical implantable devices. This work is focused on vacuum brazing of C. P titanium to 96 % alumina ceramic using pure gold as the filler metal. A novel method of brazing is developed where resistance heating of C. P titanium is done inside a thermal evaporator using a Ta heating electrode. The design of electrode is optimized using Ansys resistive heating simulations. The materials chosen {{in this study are}} biocompatible and have prior history in implantable devices approved by FDA. This research is part of Boston Retinal implant project to make a biocompatible implantable device (www. bostonretina. org). ^ Pure gold braze has been used in the construction of single terminal feedthrough in low density hermetic packages utilizing a single platinum pin brazed to an alumina or sapphire ceramic donut (brazed to a titanium case or ferrule for many years in implantable pacemakers. Pure gold (99. 99 %) brazing of 96 % alumina ceramic with CP titanium has been performed and evaluated in this dissertation. Brazing has been done by using electrical resistance heating. The 96 % alumina ceramic disk was manufactured by high temperature cofired ceramic (HTCC) processing while the Ti ferrule and gold performs were purchased from outside. Hermetic joints having leak rate of the order of 1. 6 × 10 - 8 atm-cc/ sec on a <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> were measured. ^ Alumina ceramics made by HTCC processing were centreless grounded utilizing 800 grit diamond wheel to provide a smooth surface for sputtering of a thin film of Nb. Since pure alumina demonstrates no adhesion or wetting to gold, an adhesion layer must be used on the alumina surface. Niobium (Nb), Tantalum (Ta) and Tungsten (W) were chosen for evaluation since all are refractory (less dissolution into molten gold), all form stable oxides (necessary for adhesion to alumina) and all are readily thin film deposited as metals. Wetting studies are also performed to determine the wetting angle of pure gold to Ti, Ta, Nb and W substrates. Nano tribological scratch testing of thin film of Nb (which demonstrated the best wetting properties towards gold) on polished 96 % alumina ceramic is performed to determine the adhesion strength of thin film to the substrate. The wetting studies also determined the thickness of the intermetallic compounds layers formed between Ti and gold, reaction microstructure and the dissolution of the metal into the molten gold. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{applications}} where leak {{rates of}} components or systems are evaluated against a leak rate requirement, {{the uncertainty of}} the measured leak rate must be included in the reported result. However, in the <b>helium</b> mass spectrometer <b>leak</b> detection method, the sensitivity, or resolution, of the instrument is often the only component of the total measurement uncertainty noted when reporting results. To address this shortfall, a measurement uncertainty analysis method was developed that includes the <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> unit's resolution, repeatability, hysteresis, and drift, along with the uncertainty associated with the calibration standard. In a step-wise process, the method identifies the bias and precision components of the calibration standard, the measurement correction factor (K-factor), and the <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> unit. Together these individual contributions to error are combined and the total measurement uncertainty is determined using the root-sum-square method. It was found that the precision component contributes more to the total uncertainty than the bias component, but the bias component is not insignificant. For <b>helium</b> mass spectrometer <b>leak</b> rate tests where unit sensitivity alone is not enough, a thorough evaluation of the measurement uncertainty such as the one presented herein should be performed and reported along with the leak rate value...|$|R

40|$|As {{deep space}} {{exploration}} {{continues to be}} the goal of NASAs human spaceflight program, verification of the performance of spaceflight hardware becomes increasingly critical. Suitable test methods for verifying the leak rate of sealing systems are identified in program qualification testing requirements. One acceptable method for verifying the air leak rate of gas pressure seals is the tracer gas <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> method. In this method, a tracer gas (commonly <b>helium)</b> <b>leaks</b> past the test seal and is transported to the <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> where the <b>leak</b> rate is quantified. To predict the air leak rate, a conversion factor of helium-to-air is applied depending on the magnitude of the helium flow rate. The conversion factor is based on either the molecular mass ratio or the ratio of the dynamic viscosities. The current work was aimed at validating this approach for permeation-level leak rates using a series of tests with a silicone elastomer O-ring. An established pressure decay method with constant differential pressure was used to evaluate both the air and <b>helium</b> <b>leak</b> rates of the O-ring under similar temperature and pressure conditions. The results from the pressure decay tests showed, for the elastomer O-ring, that neither the molecular flow nor the viscous flow helium-to-air conversion factors were applicable. Leak rate tests were also performed using nitrogen and argon as the test gas. Molecular mass and viscosity based helium-to-test gas conversion factors were applied, but did not correctly predict the measured leak rates of either gas. To further this study, the effect of pressure boundary conditions was investigated. Often, pressure decay leak rate tests are performed at a differential pressure of 101. 3 kPa with atmospheric pressure on the downstream side of the test seal. In space applications, the differential pressure is similar, but with vacuum as the downstream pressure. The same O-ring was tested at four unique differential pressures ranging from 34. 5 to 137. 9 kPa. Up to six combinations of upstream and downstream pressures for each differential pressure were compared. For a given differential pressure, the various combinations of upstream and downstream dry air pressures did not significantly affect the leak rate. As expected, the leak rate of the O-ring increased with increasing differential pressure. The results suggested that the current leak test pressure conditions, used to verify spacecraft sealing systems with elastomer seals, produce accurate values even though the boundary conditions do not model the space application...|$|R
