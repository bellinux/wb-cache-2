5|$|Wood {{is used in}} the {{construction}} of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making <b>joists,</b> roof trusses, roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor <b>joists.</b> This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|The bricks {{from which}} the house was built were fired in the {{immediate}} vicinity (along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River), and the brick walls were reinforced with hand-wrought structural iron angles. The nails used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith, and the wooden sills and <b>joists</b> were sawn by hand. As of 2012, all the original windows, trim and building materials in the main section of the house were still present.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} design an OWSJ, engineers consider the <b>joist</b> span between bearing points, <b>joist</b> spacing, slope, live loads, dead loads, collateral loads, seismic loads, wind uplift, deflection criteria and maximum <b>joist</b> depth allowed. Many steel <b>joist</b> manufacturers supply economical load tables {{in order to}} allow designers to select the most efficient <b>joist</b> sizes for their projects.|$|R
50|$|Common {{mistakes}} made with installing I-joists include cutting or chiseling the flange, improperly sized <b>joist</b> hangers, improper nailing and wrong-sized nails. The rim <b>joist</b> depth must match the I-joist size. Mismatches can strain the <b>joist.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor <b>joists</b> and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled <b>joists</b> and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the <b>joists</b> of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
40|$|The uplift {{resistance}} of K-series open web steel <b>joist</b> seats {{was determined by}} physical testing of twenty-eight specimens to failure. The experimental data obtained from the physical testing was evaluated along with the mechanical properties of the steel material used in fabricating the <b>joist</b> seat test specimens. A simple analytical model was developed based on the experimental results using yield-line theory, which adequately predicts the ultimate uplift capacity of the <b>joist</b> seat. This ultimate strength model was modified to create simple AISC-ASD and AISC-LRFD design equations {{to be used in}} the analysis of K-series <b>joist</b> seats for uplift. Both the AISC-ASD and the AISC-LRFD design equations consider the following variables: <b>Joist</b> seat yield strength (nominally 50 ksi), anchorage weld length, seat length, and seat angle thickness...|$|R

5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for cruise liner passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel <b>joists</b> were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E
25|$|Solid {{hardwood}} floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed {{perpendicular to the}} wooden support beams of a building (the <b>joists</b> or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors {{as well as most}} traditional wood blocks, mosaics and parquetry.|$|E

50|$|Stanley Macomber (November 26, 1887 - May 15, 1967) {{designed}} and patented the open web <b>joist</b> floor system, and founded the Massillon Steel <b>Joist</b> Company of Massillon, Ohio, and the Macomber Steel Company of Canton, Ohio.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} depth at {{the bearing}} ends {{has been established}} at 7 1/2 inches (191 mm) for all <b>Joist</b> Girders. <b>Joist</b> Girders are usually attached to the columns by bolting with two 3/4 inch diameter (19 mm) A325 bolts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{cantilever}} tests on joist-sheathing assemblies {{were conducted to}} determine the rotational restraint that sheathing provides to the compression flange of a cold-formed steel floor <b>joist</b> in bending. This rotational restraint, characterized by the stiffness, kφ, can partially or fully retard distortional buckling. Tests were conducted for different <b>joist</b> thicknesses, depths, and flange widths, two fastener types, and plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), and gypsum board sheathing. The tests show that (1) variability in plywood sheathed specimens {{is due to the}} plywood, not the connection stiffness, (2) variability in OSB specimens is low, but primarily due to the connection stiffness, not the OSB, (3) gypsum board connection stiffness is high and consistent; but strength is low and variable, (4) <b>joist</b> thickness is the most important variable for determining connection stiffness, far more important than <b>joist</b> depth, <b>joist</b> flange width, or fastener size. A new design method is proposed for adoption...|$|R
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of General Superiors Sister Anne Doherty and Sister Nancy Nolan, the church's interior was renovated in 1986 to conform with liturgical changed that were adopted after the Second Vatican Council and to strengthen the church's floor <b>joists.</b> Melvin B. G. Meyer, principal architect at Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, served as the project architect.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} use is in {{the treatment}} of 'dry rot' or 'white rot' on timber <b>joists,</b> partially rotten or affected wood readily soaks it up and the fungus is subsequently killed. The main advantage of this type of treatment is that the glycol is hygroscopic and the wood being already water damaged readily absorbs a water based product.|$|E
25|$|There should {{normally}} {{be a fairly}} wide gap between {{the floor and the}} wall to allow for expansion and to allow air to circulate. This is often covered by a skirting board or molding, to make the gap less apparent. It is because the floor is free-standing, rather than connected to walls or <b>joists,</b> that it is also referred to as a floating floor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Joist</b> Girders {{are open}} web steel trusses used as primary framing members.

50|$|While OWSJs can {{be adapted}} to suit a wide variety of {{architectural}} applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilizing standard details, which may vary from one <b>joist</b> manufacturer to another. Some other shapes, in addition to the parallel top and bottom chord, are single slope, double slope, arch, gable and scissor configurations. These shapes may not be available from all <b>joist</b> manufactures, and are usually supplied at a premium cost that reflects the complexity required.The fabrication of OWSJ in North America is overseen by the Steel <b>Joist</b> Institute (SJI). The SJI has worked since 1928 to maintain sound engineering practice throughout the industry. As a non-profit organization of active manufactures, the Institute cooperates with governmental and business agencies to establish steel <b>joist</b> standards. Continuing research and updating are included in this work. Load tables and specifications are published by the SJI in five categories: K-Series, LH-Series, DLH-Series, CJ-Series, and <b>Joist</b> Girders. Load tables are available in both Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD).|$|R

25|$|In 2002, the {{structure}} was repaired permanently using post-tensioning. The living room flagstone floor blocks were individually tagged and removed. Blocks were joined {{to the concrete}} cantilever beams and floor <b>joists,</b> high-strength steel cables were fed through the blocks and exterior concrete walls and tightened using jacks. The floors and walls were then restored, leaving Fallingwater’s interior and exterior appearance unchanged. The cantilevers now had sufficient support, and the deflection stopped.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{section is}} a single-story structure built on higher ground. An internal stone and earth walkway within the northern courtyard provided {{space for the}} occupants to sit outside their quarters. The southern courtyard complex is built on lower ground and is generally two stories, allowing space for livestock to be housed in the lower floor and space for living quarters on the upper level. The floors were rammed earth with timber <b>joists</b> and planking laid over.|$|E
25|$|George W. Buck {{designed}} the original skew arch bridge over Fairfield Street with ten cast iron arch ribs {{as part of}} a long brick arch viaduct topped with open stonework parapets. The bridge was widened by adding wrought iron plate girders and transverse girders, supporting longitudinal <b>joists</b> with iron arch plates. As part of reconstruction in the 1960s the cast iron arches and spandrels were encased in concrete. Platforms 13 and 14 are situated on the bridge.|$|E

25|$|There {{does not}} seem to be a {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There would not have been much perceived need until recently, when concrete slabs started being generally used for sub-floors. Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on <b>joists,</b> both of which provide some cushioning from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|E

40|$|In December 1992, Ms Jennifer Hamilton of J. Hamilton & Associates {{contracted}} TWP {{to evaluate}} a specimen comprising a failed timber <b>joist</b> taken froma building site in the Glenwood Estate, Mackay. The timber was provisionally identified visually as Forest Red Gum or Red Ironbark, most probably Structural Grade 4 because of grain orientation. There was considerable cross-grain {{in the region of}} the failure. The grain ran at an angle of 40 degrees to the length of the <b>joist.</b> Before installation, the top surface of the <b>joist</b> had been painted with a "whitewash" which had evidently penetrated into an open shake (grain oriented split). All unpainted surfaces of the <b>joist,</b> including the region of failure, indicated substantial exposure to the weather because of the grey colour of fibres. There were no fresh, unexposed fibres apparent in the region of failure. The ambient density (963 kg/m 3) of the <b>joist</b> was determined by measuring volume and weight. The ambient moisture content (12 %) was determined using a moisture meter and by correcting readings for species factors. Measurements were taken at 23 deg. C and 65 % relative humidity. " [...] p.
