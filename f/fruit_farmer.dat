2500|$|Patrick Matthew (20 October 1790 – 8 June 1874) was a Scottish grain merchant, <b>fruit</b> <b>farmer,</b> forester, and landowner, {{who contributed}} to the {{understanding}} of horticulture, silviculture, and agriculture in general, with a focus on maintaining the British navy and feeding new colonies. [...] He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation (i.e. resulting from positive natural selection, in contrast to its already, widely known, negative rôle in removal of individuals in the Struggle for Survival), but failed to develop or publicise his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated (independently of each other) the theory of evolution by natural selection; {{it has been suggested that}} Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is no hard [...] evidence of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book, On Naval Timber and Aboriculture.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Agricultural {{workers are}} known to have {{occupational}} skin diseases. The prevalence and pattern of skin diseases are unknown in Taiwanese <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the work exposure, prevalence of skin diseases, and sensitivity to common skin allergens and agricultural chemicals in <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> of southern Taiwan. METHODS: 122 <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> who regularly prepared and sprayed pesticides and a group of 63 printing press workers with no known exposure to pesticides were examined and patch tested with common skin allergens and agricultural chemicals. The farmers were also interviewed for their work habits, use of protective clothing, and exposure to pesticides. RESULTS: Most farmers reported regular use of hat, boots, and mask, but not gloves, raincoat, and goggles. This resulted in frequent skin contact with pesticides especially on the hands and face. About 30 % of farmers had hand dermatitis, and more than two thirds had pigmentation and thickening on the hands. Fungal infection of the skin was noted in a quarter of subjects. By patch test, farmers and the printing press workers had a similar rate of sensitivity to common skin allergens. 40 % of farmers were sensitive to agricultural chemical allergens, which was about twofold higher than that of the comparison group. Farmers were most frequently sensitive to Captofol, Folpet, and Captan which were associated with dermatitis on the volar aspects of the hands. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> in southern Taiwan had a high prevalence of skin diseases related to use of pesticides, and appropriate protective measures and work practices should be taken to prevent such problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of agri-food marketing systems worldwide {{has implications for}} small-scale <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> in Thailand. Effective strategic marketing decisions (SMDs) of farmers are essential elements in response to market transformation. Based on the theory of strategic decision making, SMDs are made {{in regards to the}} availability of internal resources, the dynamics of the external environment and the goals that need to be accomplished. Previous literature mostly explains the SMDs of individual farmers in developed countries. Research work in developing countries generally concentrates on SMDs, in order to link small-scale farmers to markets. Characterised by small-scale operations farmers in Thailand were not considered as being leading actors in agri-food value chains. As a result, available research on SMDs, which reflect farmers' strategic capability, was scarce within a Thailand context. This study employed a quantitative survey-based approach to determine key factors that affect the SMDs of <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> in Chanthaburi province of Thailand. Qualitative data was also collected in a pilot study, in order to develop the conceptual model and the foundation of the questionnaire. The survey data was collected from 216 <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers,</b> through the use of face-to-face interviews with structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed to describe and compare the <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> who used traditional marketing channels (TM users) with those who used high-value marketing channels (HM users). Furthermore, factor analysis was employed to identify factors included in the conceptual model, and logistic regression was employed to test the hypotheses. This study found that SMDs towards high-value market participation were positively related to business size, experience in fruit farming, perceived importance of market requirements, and farmers' goals in regards to effectiveness. The results suggest that small business sized farms need to improve their productivity and increase their business capacity, via collective actions {{that would allow them to}} benefit from collective learning with experienced farmers, which could lead to updated market information. It was also noted that some farmers aimed to achieve their production goals by focusing on efficiency, while others desired a simple lifestyle by focusing their lives on self-sufficiency. This implied that different types of farmers needed to be encouraged in different ways, in order to develop their strategic capabilities as important stakeholders in the fruit industry of Thailand...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the extent to which <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> from Hebei Province are using stationary and mobile Internet to acquire agricultural knowledge and technologies. Specific objectives of this dissertation were to determine Hebei fruit farmers’ use of Internet-related devices and Internet, identify Hebei fruit farmers’ perceptions regarding the Internet and its use and the sources of information and its use, evaluate Hebei <b>fruit</b> <b>farmer’s</b> opinions regarding the credibility of online agricultural knowledge/information, and identify the obstacles that Hebei <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> face as well as their reactions to these obstacles. Descriptive research design employed narrative survey methodology. Research data were collected from a structured questionnaire through field distribution. Five hundred and eleven questionnaires were collected from six counties of Hebei province, China. Results of the narrative survey questionnaire revealed that, even though cellphone ownership for <b>fruit</b> <b>farmers</b> was as high as 98 %, mobile Internet adoption rate increased only gradually. Chinese fruit farmers’ overall Internet use as a source of agricultural extension and education remained at a low level of efficiency. There was utilization bias among different Internet access formats. There were also questions about the reliability of the Internet disseminated agricultural knowledge and information. Most (52. 5 %; 57. 9 %, respectively) respondents verified they obtained knowledge and information via the Internet first with other farmers before actually using it. One third (33 %) indicated that they had heard of training programs on how to use the Internet. Only 6 % had taken such training. Similar deficiencies were found with online agricultural education courses. It has been widely assumed that fruit farmers’ Internet use with extension and education purposes would grow rapidly, similar to computer and cellphone adoption in rural areas. However, the use of the Internet as a source of agricultural and extension education is not as outwardly evident as has been the adoption of Internet devices, and common Internet surfing is not an indicator of the adoption of Internet-based agricultural extension. The knowledge gained in this study will help people in the field to facilitate the development of essential programs that will more closely match the basic needs of Internet-device utilization as well as Internet surfing...|$|R
