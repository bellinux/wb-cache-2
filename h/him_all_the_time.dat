25|$|Due to his {{scientific}} reputation, Thunberg {{was given the}} opportunity in 1776 to accompany the Dutch ambassador M. Feith to the shogun's court in Edo, today's Tokyo. During that journey, the Swede was {{given the chance to}} collect a great number of specimen of plants and animals and likewise to talk to Japanese locals in the villages they traversed on their way. It is in this time that Thunberg wrote two of {{his scientific}} master pieces, the Flora Japonica (1784) and the Fauna Japonica (1833). The latter was completed by the German traveller Philipp Franz von Siebold who visited Japan between 1823 and 1829. Yet, von Siebold based the Fauna Japonica on Thunberg's notes which he carried with <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in Japan.|$|E

At the time, Wotton became one of 17 defendants, all males, charged in the Palm Island riots and was alleged to be the riot ringleader. At the Townsville Magistrate Court on 29 November, Wotton was charged with [...] "arson (two counts), serious assault on police (three counts), wilful damage and riot causing damage".|$|E

Call him an injustice. Call him {{whatever you want to}} call him, but in his face all the time." [...] Gravel was criticized for potentially involving the children of the prosecutor, and Al-Arian's family disavowed the sentiments.|$|E

[...] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's [...] "greatest pitcher of his time" [...] {{as well as a}} finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E
2500|$|Grampa Johnson (Oliver [...] "Swede" [...] Johnson) — Alice's father, who spoils Dennis often. He {{evokes the}} unintentional jealousy of Mr. Wilson, for {{he gets to}} see Dennis only on occasion, but Mr. Wilson sees <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Because they are so much alike, Dennis and Grampa Johnson get along beautifully. Mr. Wilson also thinks that Johnson should act his age, but this advice is often ignored. To Grampa, life is worth living and he {{encourages}} Dennis to live it to the fullest. His wife's status is unknown; she is never seen in the comics, although she is mentioned twice: once when, thanks to Dennis, a furious Alice finds out that Henry had thrown his mother-in-law's gift (a tie) into the trash.; another time Alice wished her mother a Happy Mother’s Day via the telephone.|$|E
2500|$|By 1923, the Lolomi {{plan was}} progressing. Chester told the Daily Oklahoman {{that he wanted}} the Keetoowah some day to be [...] "in a {{position}} where they can work for the common good and build up a surplus {{for the good of the}} community." [...] However, shortly thereafter, the bank at Gore failed. The cattle herd was taken by creditors and those who had mortgaged their allotments lost their land. In the post War War I depression of the early 1920s, many sound banks and businesses failed, and the circumstances appear to have been beyond Kellogg's diligence. George Smith, fifth son of Redbird Smith, recalled, [...] "C.P. was awful smart. You couldn't get ahead of him. The white people was scared of <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> watching what he was doing with the Keetoowahs. He was a good man, but the white people were against him, and we had some bad luck." [...] After the collapse of the Lolomi Plan, some Keetoowahs believed that Cornelius cheated them and he was dismissed as spokesman for the Ketoowah Society [...] In 1925, Cornelius was raised as a chief of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and continued to reside in Gore, Oklahoma, and play a role with his sister in national Indian affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Sam Smith, one of {{the sons}} of Redbird Smith, became chief of the Nighthawk Keetoowah Society, while Cornelius {{continued}} as spokesman and legal counsel. [...] Restrictions were removed from several allotments and they were mortgaged to fund and establish a bank in Gore with Cornelius as president. In 1920, Kellogg published a book titled [...] "Our Democracy in the American Indian", where she proposed a Lolomai Plan, later spelled Lolomi, which means [...] "good, beautiful, wise" [...] in the Hopi language. [...] Her book was [...] "lovingly dedicated" [...] {{to the memory of}} Chief Redbird Smith, spiritual leader of the Nighthawk Keetoowah, [...] "who preserved his people from demoralization, and was the first to accept the Lolomi." [...] In 1921, a hundred Cherokees from 35 families moved together to the southeastern corner of Cherokee County, Oklahoma, to create a traditional community. By 1923, the Lolomi plan was progressing, and Kellogg told the Daily Oklahoman that he wanted the Keetoowah some day to be [...] "in a position where they can work for the common good and build up a surplus {{for the good of the}} community."
