In 1900, Australia was arguably the highest-income country in the world on a per capita basis. But by 1950 its rank had slipped to third; by 1970 it was eighth; and by the 1990 s Australia was not even in the top twenty” and that “Australia’s comparatively poor growth performance for most of the twentieth century contrasts with that of the final decade, when Australia out-performed all other advanced economies other than Ireland and Norway". The author claims that part of that success is attributable to the “belated opening of the Australian economy {{to the rest of the}} world”.|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{pyrolysis}} {{is presented}} as a new production method of SnO 2 nanocrystalline powders suitable for gas sensor devices. The method is based on a pyrolytic reaction of high tensioned stressed drops of an organic solution of SnCl 4 · 5 (H 2 O). The main advantages of the method are its capability to produce SnO 2 nanopowders with high stability, its accurate control over the grain size and other structural characteristics, its high level of repeatability and its low <b>industrialization</b> implementation <b>cost.</b> The characterization of samples of SnO 2 nanoparticles obtained by liquid pyrolysis in the range between 200 ºC and 900 ºC processing temperature is carried out by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results are analyzed and discussed so as to validate the advantages of the liquid pyrolysis method...|$|R

Key {{to the success of}} these ventures is the availability of plentiful, cost effective electric power and assured, low cost access to space. While forecasts of space power needs are problematic, an assessment of future needs based on terrestrial experience has been made. These needs fall into three broad categories: survival, self sufficiency, and <b>industrialization.</b> The <b>cost</b> of delivering payloads to orbital locations from LEO to Mars has been determined and future launch cost reductions projected. From these factors, then, projections of the performance necessary for future solar and nuclear space power options has been made. These goals are largely dependent upon orbital location and energy storage needs. Finally the cost of present space power systems has been determined and projections made for future systems...|$|R

The industry has taken initiatives to commercialize the zero-emission electric vehicles in a large scale, but limitations involved with EV technology are found {{as a barrier to}} the rapid <b>industrialization.</b> Considering the <b>cost</b> and production time issues, this research chooses suitable propulsion system, motor, vehicle parameter and proposes an entire layout for retrofitting an existing petrol vehicle. The proposed layout is analysed, simulated and experimented on a test vehicle for a sustainable dynamic behaviour in different manoeuvring conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} resource development and <b>industrialization.</b> When transport <b>costs</b> are high, regions with more valuable natural resources offer higher welfare than other regions. However, when transport costs decrease, firms begin {{to move out of}} the region, resulting in the Dutch disease, initially in terms of industry shares, but eventually in terms of welfare too when transportation is sufficiently free. If resource goods are also used as manufacturing inputs as well as final goods, they can substitute for labor when wages rise, which tends to alleviate the Dutch disease by keeping production costs down. The model thus provides helpful insight for cities trying to develop efficiently their limited resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>industrialization</b> are lower <b>costs,</b> mass production, considerable use of machinery and labor saving. The idea of pre-casting evolved from constructing building structures through industrialized sequences. Each segment {{is to be}} manufactured in factories with standard procedures and assembled on site to save manpower. Tying reinforcing bars is undoubtedly an indispensable procedure in concrete structure construction. Rising technologies have brought this work to many solutions, such as the adoption of welded wire fabric. Despite the achievements of industrialization of construction, there are still not sufficient solutions to satisfy various needs in housing construction. More efforts shall be spent to develop the best “composite method”, which combines and integrates various technologies for building construction...|$|R

While many scholars perceive Prebisch as supporting import substitution industrialization (ISI), in which a nation progressively changes its imports and internal production, focusing on <b>industrialization,</b> at the <b>cost</b> of imported [...] "superfluous" [...] goods in favor of capital and intermediate goods for a given period of time, Prebisch criticized protectionism, especially that practiced by Juan Perón in Argentina, since 1956 and ISI since at least 1963. He advocated industrialization and economic cooperation, including through trade, among developing countries.

40|$|Perovskite {{solar cells}} have {{attracted}} enormous interest since their discovery {{only a few}} years ago because they are able to combine the benefits of high efficiency and remarkable ease of processing over large areas. Whereas most of research has been carried out on glass, perovskite deposition and synthesis is carried out at low temperatures (< 150 °C) to convert precursors into its final semiconducting form. Thus, developing the technology on flexible substrates can be considered a suitable and exciting arena both from the manufacturing view point (e. g. web processing, low embodied energy manufacturing) and that of the applications (e. g. flexible, lightweight, portable, easy to integrate over both small, large and curved surfaces). Research has been accelerating on flexible PSCs and has achieved notable milestones including PCEs of 15. 6 % on laboratory cells, the first modules being manufactured, ultralight cells with record power per gram ratios, and even cells made on fibres. Reviewing the literature, it becomes apparent that more work can be carried out in closing the efficiency gap with glass based counterparts especially at the large-area module level and, in particular, investigating and improving the lifetime of these devices which are built on inherently permeable plastic films. Here we review and provide a perspective on the issues pertaining progress in materials, processes, devices, <b>industrialization</b> and <b>costs</b> of flexible perovskite solar cells...|$|R
40|$|In {{universal}} banking, large banks operate extensive {{networks of}} branches, provide many different services, hold several claims on firms (including equity and debt), and participate {{directly in the}} corporate governance of firms that rely on the banks for funding or as insurance underwriters. In this paper, the author contrasts the <b>cost</b> of financing <b>industrialization</b> in the United States and in Germany during the second industrial revolution. He explains that large production is typical of modern industrial practice, so the lessons from that period apply broadly to contemporary developing countries. The second industrial revolution involved many new products and technologies. Firms were producing new goods in new ways on an unprecedented scale. Therefore, they needed quick access to heavy financing. Finance costs for industry were lower in Germany than in the United States, because U. S. regulations prevented the universal banking from which Germany benefited. High finance costs retarded U. S. realization of its full industrial potential. The potential to expand quickly and reap economies of scale was greater in German <b>industrialization.</b> The <b>cost</b> of industrial financing began to decline when institutional changes came about that increased the concentration of financial market transactions. In recent decades, a combination of macroeconomic distress, international competitive pressure, and the creative invention of new financial intermediaries has helped the U. S. financial system overcome the regulatory mandate of financial fragmentation.

40|$|The {{salmon farming}} {{industry}} is shifting from an entrepreneurial spirit towards <b>industrialization</b> and <b>cost</b> efficiency. Large players are purchasing the small players,and {{the industry is}} consolidating. Optimization is therefore becoming more relevant,but little academic {{work has been done}} on the freshwater part of the valuechain. This thesis presents a linear stochastic programming model that minimizes the totalexpected costs related to smolt production. One of its innovations is a linearformulation using SOS 2, enabling water temperature to be a decision variable. Themain uncertainty, freshwater intake temperature, is modeled through the use of scenarios,which were generated using a seasonal AR(1) -model. Testing and feedbacksessions with biologists were conducted to ensure model quality. The model was applied to two case studies involving the Marine Harvest freshwaterfacility at Sl&# 248;rdal, S&# 248;r-Tr&# 248;ndelag. The first case investigates a typical two year production plan, while the other explores the production of 500 grams smolts, whichis a new product. These case studies have yielded three core insights. First, theyindicate that optimization can {{have a significant impact on}} the total costs. A typicaltwo year production plan at the Sl&# 248;rdal facility experienced a total cost reductionof 11 %. Second, smolt orders can be fulfilled with reduced water heating comparedto today?s praxis if the fry are deployed earlier. Third, 500 grams smolt should bedelivered during the winter to exploit the natural temperature seasonalities. Smoltdelivered during the winter has significantly lower cost and production time comparedto other seasons. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{economic}} progress agriculture must free its resources {{for the development of}} other activities, {{but at the same time}} increase production. In Croatia this did not happen, predominantly because private agriculture was pushed into the margins for political reasons. Its passive role as a reservoir of labour and a cheap source of agricultural produce for the urban population and manufacturing industry reflects the implementation of the socialist idea about <b>industrialization</b> at all <b>costs.</b> We quantified the price of this type of development by following the armies of farmers from 1946 to 1991, which enabled us to estimate the number of employed private farmers in the 1961 - 1991 period. Today the village suffers from a major problem of senilization and feminization, resulting from a long period of emigration and changes in the demographic structure of the agricultural population. Nevertheless, we must emphasize that employment in agriculture is greater than it currently is in many other fields of the economy, and that even after the rejection of socialist dogma private agriculture is still being unjustifiably neglected...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyse Friedrich List's {{contribution}} to the modern theory of economic development. We argue that Friedrich List saw economic development as {{a combination of a}} sectorial division of labour (following Adam Smith, 1776) and a geographical division of labour across regions and countries. In this sense, the passage from a traditional economy to an industrial one consists of balanced growth at both the sectorial and geographical level, as we see in modern development economics (see Rosentein-Rodan, 1943; and Murphy et al., 1989). In addition, List highlights the role of transport <b>costs</b> in the <b>industrialization</b> process {{not only in terms of}} the costs incurred by firms, but also how <b>industrialization</b> affects these <b>costs,</b> since modern technology produces goods that are ?lighter? to transport than goods produced with traditional technology. In this sense, contrary to what is usually attributed to List, tariffs are not the central part of his argument for industrialization. He puts more emphasis on the creation of a larger internal market via for instance a customs union and the complementarities between resources and sectors in a country. We illustrate these arguments with a model...|$|R
40|$|Following Smith¡¯s {{advocacy}} {{of free trade}} and competition, David Ricardo attempts to strengthen his theory of absolute advantage, which excludes from international trade countries which have no advantages over others, by eliminating this weakness. To do so, Ricardo introduces to the economics literature a {{theory of comparative cost}} advantage which includes countries that do not have absolute advantages in international trade. In Ricardo¡¯s framework, these countries can still gain from free trade. We present direct and indirect critiques which reveal that their {{advocacy of}} free trade is questionable. In our direct critiques we find that Ricardo¡¯s attempt is questionable for the following reasons. First, the scale of production of cloth in Portugal and that of wine in England equal 1 even though {{there is no reason to}} believe that two countries have the same scale of production for two different commodities. Second, it is argued that his theory is incomplete because it is based on particular numbers, does not determine the terms of trade, and does not take into account the unintended curtailment of demand in both countries, which in turn can make trade non-beneficial for both countries. In our indirect critiques, first we argue that Ricardo assumes the equality between the relative price and relative labor cost of two commodities even though they are different. Second, it is shown that the outcome of complete specialization in his theory prevents a country from specializing in the production of a commodity that could generate for itself a substantial profit in the long run, locking the country out of industrialization. We then point out that Samuelson who supports Ricardo¡¯s theory to some extent does not consider in his proof the possible destruction of the domestic industry in the case of free trade, even though this might make domestic consumers worse off and also lock a country out of <b>industrialization.</b> Comparative <b>Costs,</b> Complete Specialization, Scale of Production, Relative Price and Labor Cost, Gain from Free Trade, Lock out of Industrialization...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{development}} in Africa has carried with it significant health costs. These costs are normally defined rather narrowly by those concerned about occupational or industrial {{health and safety}} and refer only to the health consequences of worker exposure to specific hazardous processes, materials or environmental conditions associated with the workplace. A more comprehensive measurement of industrial health costs, however, must also include {{an assessment of the}} impact which industrial development and the creation of an industrial workforce has on ecological relationships, environmental conditions and patterns of sickness and health in the areas surrounding industrial centers. Traditional definitions of occupational health also tend to focus attention on the immediate causal linkages which exist between the development of particular industrial processes and specific health hazards. Yet any attempt to fully understand the causes of industrial health problems in Africa must look beyond these immediate causal linkages and examine the wider political and economic forces which determine the shape of industrial development {{and the extent to which}} the health costs of this development are borne by industrial workers and their families, as well as by people who may not be directly or even indirectly connected to industrial development, but may, nonetheless, be exposed to its health risks. The paper surveys the direct and indirect health costs of mining, large scale agriculture, and manufacturing in Africa and examines the economic and political interests which have determined the distribution of these <b>costs.</b> <b>industrialization</b> occupational health Africa political economy...|$|R

Discoveries of the physics of the Quantum Universe would come from powerful next generation particle accelerators. Fermilab’s Tevatron, currently the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, will shut down {{by the end of}} this decade after the LHC at CERN begins operations. At the LHC, U.

To follow the LHC, physicists propose the International Linear Collider, a globally funded and operated accelerator to build on LHC results and illuminate Terascale science. Fermilab will work to host the proposed ILC in the U. S. as soon as possible, maintaining the nation’s historic leadership of frontier particle physics. Should events postpone the start of the ILC, Fermilab would build an intensity-frontier accelerator at one percent of the ILC’s length and combine it with existing accelerators to create Project X. Project X’s intense beams would give Fermilab’s scientific users a new way into the world of neutrinos and precision physics. With its ILC technology, Project X would spur U. S. <b>industrialization</b> and reduce <b>costs</b> of ILC components while advancing accelerator science for future applications in particle physics and beyond. In addition, Project X would drive forward the technology for still higher-energy accelerators of the future, such as a muon collider.
