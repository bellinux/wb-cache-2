40|$|The {{effect of}} {{through-thickness}} reinforcement by fibrous pins on the static tensile strength, fatigue life and failure mechanisms of single lap joints made of carbon/epoxy composite is investigated. Pinning is highly effective in increasing the ultimate strength, <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> and fatigue life.

Which mechanism induces ultimate failure in the presence of pins depends on their volume content and diameter. The trends with volume content and diameter can be predicted qualitatively using analytical results from a previously published model of the deformation mechanics of pins loaded in mixed mode...|$|E

We propose {{a simple and}} effective model based on Graessley and Pearson's topological model (GP model) for describing the topological effect.

We introduce a new parameter γ to describe entropic contributions from the entanglement of polymer loops, which may be determined from the structural characteristics of the sample. The model is evaluated in the light of experimental data under uniaxial and biaxial deformations. As a result, our model exhibits uniaxial behaviors which are common to many elastomers in various deformation regimes such as Mooney-Rivlin's relation in small extension, stress divergence in the <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> and the declined stress in compression. Furthermore, it is also qualitatively consistent with biaxial experiments, which can be explained by few theoretical models. Comment: 7 page...|$|E

40|$|In {{this and}} the {{accompanying}} paper {{the problem of the}} maximally achievable elongation in a tokamak is investigated. The work represents an extension of many earlier studies, which were often focused on determining the elongation limits due to (1) natural elongation in a simple applied pure vertical field or (2) axisymmetric stability {{in the presence of a}} perfectly conducting wall. The extension investigated here includes the effect of the vertical stability feedback system which actually sets the maximum practical <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> in a real experiment. A basic resistive wall stability parameter (gammatau) is introduced to model the feedback system which although simple in appearance actually captures the essence of the feedback system. Elongation limits in the presence of feedback are then determined by calculating the maximum elongation against n= 0 resistive wall modes for fixed gammatau. The results are obtained by means of a general formulation culminating in a variational principle which is particularly amenable to numerical analysis. The principle is valid for arbitrary profiles but simplifies significantly for the Solov'ev profiles, effectively reducing the 2 -D stability problem into a 1 -D problem.

40|$|Starch is {{the main}} storage {{polysaccharide}} in cereals and {{the major source of}} calories in the human diet. It is synthesized by a panel of enzymes including five classes of starch synthases (SSs). While the overall starch synthase (SS) reaction is known, the functional differences between the five SS classes are poorly understood. Much of our knowledge comes from analyzing mutant plants with altered SS activities, but the resulting data are often difficult to interpret as a result of pleitropic effects, competition between enzymes, overlaps in enzyme activity and disruption of multi-enzyme complexes. Here we provide a detailed biochemical study of the activity of all five classes of SSs in barley endosperm. Each enzyme was produced recombinantly in E. coli and the properties and modes of action in vitro were studied in isolation from other SSs and other substrate modifying activities. Our results define the mode of action of each SS class in unprecedented detail; we analyze their substrate selection, temperature dependence and stability, substrate affinity and temporal abundance during barley development. Our results are at variance with some generally accepted ideas about starch biosynthesis and might lead to the reinterpretation of results obtained in planta. In particular, they indicate that granule bound SS is capable of processive action {{even in the absence of}} a starch matrix, that SSI has no <b>elongation</b> <b>limit,</b> and that SSIV, believed to be critical for the initiation of starch granules, has maltoligosaccharides and not polysaccharides as its preferred substrates...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{potential}} for the alkali–silica reaction (ASR) in radiation shielding concrete containing special aggregates is presented. The tests were performed on two kinds of aggregate: (1) high-density aggregate to absorb the gamma radiation (barite, magnetite, and hematite) and (2) mineral with high bound water content to attenuate the neutron flux (serpentinite). The optical microscopy in transparent light on thin sections, XRD and XRF method, was used to assess the mineral composition of aggregates. ASTM C 1260 test method for potential alkali reactivity of aggregates was applied also to investigate the effect of different content and crystal size of silica on the expansion due to ASR. The tests revealed that all tested aggregates, such as barite, magnetite, hematite, and serpentinite, were characterized by low solubility at high pH. The XRD and XRF results have shown presence of silica in all tested aggregates, but the microscopic observations enhanced size and composition of SiO 2 crystals. The aggregates were not deleterious themselves, but the different content and size of SiO 2 crystals in the aggregate influenced their potential for alkali–silica reaction. The quartz in heavy kinds of rocks and in the serpentinite used for radiation shielding was just as much potentially susceptible to deleterious ASR as quartz in common rocks used in concrete technology. In the hematite, silica crystals were classified as microcrystalline, so it should be considered as potentially reactive. The expansion tests confirmed that hematite was highly reactive.

Therefore, this study was performed to assess the relevance of using moon’s age as an alternative in Imkanur rukyah criteria used in Malaysia. The study utilised the data of the sun and the moon’s positions, the time of sunset, the time of moonset and the time of conjunction (new moon). The data for the sun were calculated based on VSOP 87 theory, while for the moon, using ELP 2000 - 82 b.

These conditions show that the moon’s age criterion is not always consistent with the geometric criteria. Therefore, the use of moon’s age as an alternate criterion in determining the beginning of Hijri month is considered irrelevant and should be further reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Ice sheets flowing {{across a}} {{sedimentary}} bed usually produce {{a landscape of}} blister-like landforms streamlined {{in the direction of}} the ice flow and with each bump of the order of 102 to 103 m in length and 101 m in relief. Such landforms, known as drumlins, have mystified investigators for over a hundred years. A satisfactory explanation for their formation, and thus an appreciation of their glaciological significance, has remained elusive. A recent advance has been in numerical modelling of the land-forming process. In anticipation of future modelling endeavours, this paper is motivated by the requirement for robust data on drumlin size and shape for model testing. From a systematic programme of drumlin mapping from digital elevation models and satellite images of Britain and Ireland, we used a geographic information system to compile a range of statistics on length L, width W, and elongation ratio E (where E = L/W) for a large sample. Mean L, is found to be 629 m (n = 58, 983), mean W is 209 m and mean E is 2. 9 (n = 37, 043). Most drumlins are between 250 and 1000 metres in length; between 120 and 300 metres in width; and between 1. 7 and 4. 1 times as long as they are wide. Analysis of such data and plots of drumlin width against length reveals some new insights. All frequency distributions are unimodal from which we infer that the geomorphological label of ‘drumlin’ is fair in that this is a true single population of landforms, rather than an amalgam of different landform types. Drumlin size shows a clear minimum bound of around 100 m (horizontal). Maybe drumlins are generated at many scales and this is the minimum, or this value may be an indication of the fundamental scale of bump generation (‘proto-drumlins’) prior to them growing and elongating. A relationship between drumlin width and length is found (with r 2 = 0. 48) and that is approximately W = 7 L 1 / 2 when measured in metres. A surprising and sharply-defined line bounds the data cloud plotted in E–W–L space, and records a scale-dependent maximum <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> (approximated by Emax = L 1 / 3, when L measured in metres). For a given length, for some reason as yet unknown, drumlins do not exceed the elongation ratio defined by this scaling law. We also report and compare our statistics to an amalgamated sample (25, 907 drumlins) of measures derived from around 50 published investigations. Any theory must be able to explain the drumlin statistics and fundamental scaling properties reported herein and they thus provide powerful tests for drumlin modelling. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of vimentin intermediate filaments {{and the high}} molecular weight filament crosslinking protein, synemin, was studied in erythroid cells from 10 -day chicken embryos. Pulse labeling studies show that newly synthesized vimentin is present both in a Triton X- 100 -insoluble form and in a soluble form. The incorporation of labeled vimentin into the insoluble fraction increases linearly with time, while the soluble pool of labeled vimentin saturates quickly. In contrast, synemin accumulates rapidly in the Triton X- 100 -soluble fraction and begins to accumulate in the insoluble fraction only after a considerable lag of time. Pulse-chase studies reveal that the detergent-soluble pools of both vimentin and synemin contain precursors for their post-translational assembly into detergent-insoluble filaments and that the half-life of soluble synemin is about {{twice as long as}} that of soluble vimentin. Immunoprecipitation of solubilized filaments with synemin antiserum precipitates vimentin with synemin. On the other hand, soluble vimentin does not coimmunoprecipitate with soluble synemin.

40|$|Ductility is {{a measure}} of the ability of a material, section, {{structural}} element or structural system to sustain deformations prior to collapse without substantial loss of resistance. The Australian design standard, AS 3600, imposes minimum ductility requirements on structural concrete members to try to prevent premature non-ductile failure and hence to ensure adequate strength and ductile-type collapse with large deflections. The requirements also enable members to resist imposed deformation due to differential settlement, time effects on the concrete and temperature effects, whilst ensuring sufficient carrying capacity and a safe design. Current AS 3600 requirements allow a limited increase or reduction in elastically determined bending moments in critical regions of indeterminate beams, accommodating their ability to redistribute moment from highly stressed regions to other parts of the beam. Design moment redistribution limits and ductility requirements in AS 3600 for bonded partially prestressed beams are a simple extension of the requirements for reinforced members. The possibility of premature non-ductile failure occurring by fracture of the reinforcement or prestressing steel in partially prestressed members has not adequately addressed. The aim of this research is to investigate the overload behaviour and deformation capacity of bonded post-tensioned beams. The current ductility requirements and design moment redistribution limits according to AS 3600 are tested to ensure designs are both safe and economical. A local flexural deformation model based on the discrete cracked block approach is developed to predict the deformation capacity of high moment regions. The model predicts behaviour from an initial uncracked state through progressive crack development into yielding and collapse. Local deformations are considered in the model using non-linear material laws and local slip behaviour between steel and concrete interfaces, with rigorous definition of compatibility in the compression and tension zones. The model overcomes limitations of past discrete cracked block models by ensuring compatibility of deformation, rather than strain compatibility. This improvement allows the modeling of members with multiple layers of tensile reinforcement and variable depth prestressing tendons having separate material and bond properties. An analysis method for simple and indeterminate reinforced and partially prestressed members was developed, based on the proposed deformation model. To account for the effect of shear in regions of high moment and shear present over the interior supports of a continuous beam, a modification to the treatment of local steel deformation in the flexural model, based on the truss analogy, was undertaken. Secondary reactions and moments due to prestress and continuity are also accounted for in the analysis. A comparison of past beam test data and predictions by the analysis shows the cracking pattern and deformation capacity at ultimate of flexural regions in reinforced and partially prestressed members to be predicted with high accuracy. The analysis method accurately predicts local steel behaviour over a cracked region and deformation capacity for a wide range of beams which fail either by fracture of steel or crushing of the concrete. A parametric study is used to investigate the influence of different parameters on the deformation capacity of a typical negative moment region in a continuous beam. The structural system consists of a bonded post-tensioned, partially prestressed band beam. The primary parameters investigated are the member height and span-to-depth ratio; relative quantity of reinforcing and prestressing steel; material properties and bond capacity of the steels; and lastly the compression zone properties. Results show that the effects of the various parameters on the overload behaviour of partially prestressed beams follow the same trends as reinforced beams. A new insight into the local steel behaviour between cracks is attained. The deformation behaviour displays different trends for parametric variations of the local bond capacity, bar diameter and crack spacing, when compared to past analytical predictions from comparable studies. The discrepancy in findings is traced back to the definition of the plastic rotation capacity and the sequencing of the yielding of the steels. Compared to the other local deformation models, the current model does not assume a linear distribution of strain at a crack. The current findings highlight an important difference between predicted behaviours from different deformation compatibility requirements in local deformation models which has not yet been discussed in the literature. The local deformation model evaluates the relationship between maximum steel strain at a crack and average steel deformation over a crack spacing for the entire loading history. The total steel percentage, hardening properties of the steel and concrete strength are shown by the model to have the greatest effect on these steel strain localisation factors. Section analysis, as currently used in design, can be improved with the proposed simplification of the relationships to identify and quantify the effects of steel fracture on deformation capacity and strength. The numerical effort required to simulate the overload behaviour of practical beam designs with multiple reinforcement elements and a prestressing tendon are currently too great to be used in an extensive numerical study. The numerically more efficient smeared block approach is shown to accurately predict the ultimate carrying capacity of prestressed beams failing by crushing of the concrete. Consequently, this method is adopted to study the allowable limits of moment redistribution in the present investigation, Simplified relationships of the steel strain localisation factors evaluated in the parametric study of deformation capacity is used to predict maximum steel strains and premature failure. The limits of moment redistribution in bonded, post-tensioned partially prestressed band beams are explored by comparing the design load and predicted carrying capacity, for different section ductilities and design moment redistribution. In addition, the effects of different concrete strengths, up to 85 MPa, along with as three reinforcing and prestressing steel ductilities are quantified and compared to current Australian and international design requirements. Limitations in the carrying capacity are investigated for different reinforcement and prestress uniform elongation capacities. More than one thousand beam simulations produce results showing that current design moment redistribution and ductility requirements in the Australian design code for concrete structures (AS 3600) are sufficient for normal strength concretes (less than 50 MPa). A suggestion for design moment redistribution limits, section ductility requirements and steel ductility limits is made for members constructed from higher strength concretes. A special high steel ductility class is proposed for both the reinforcement and prestressing steel to allow moment redistribution in higher strength concrete. No moment redistribution is proposed for members reinforced with low ductility (Class L) steel. An increase of the current <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> of Class L steel from 1. 5 % to 2. 5 % is suggested to ensure strength and safety. An increase in the current ductility requirements from fsu/ fsy= 1. 03 and elongation equal to 1. 5 % to fsu/fsy= 1. 05 and 2. 5 % elongation for low ductility Class L steel is suggested to ensure strength and safety.

40|$|Conventional IC {{packages}} form a rigid shell around silicon IC dies. Their {{purpose is}} to provide environmental protection, electrical interconnect and heat dissipation. Despite the fact that majority of current silicon IC?s are realized in a very thin top layer of the silicon substrate (< 10 µm), the typical thickness of packaged IC dies generally exceeds 150 µm. Continuous system miniaturization and performance improvement leads to new mass volume applications where packaging technology has to be reviewed. Here only the essential part of silicon IC?s i. e. the 10 - 20 µm thick top layer could be retained after thinning of the wafer. In the wafer thickness range of 10 – 30 ?m, silicon substrates become mechanically flexible and consequently offer a large field of new products and innovative applications. A promising development of flexible and stretchable substrates is proposed. 3 D deformable electronics could be realized by the vertical thinning and lateral partitioning of the silicon substrate on sub-millimeter scale. The partitions or so-called segments can be combined to larger electronic systems by connecting many of these through electrical bridges. By varying the dimensions and/or the geometry of the segments and the gap size in between the segments {{as well as the}} geometry of the electrical bridges, the level of deformations can be controlled. In practical realization such patterned silicon structures have to be embedded/sandwiched into a polymer film to provide environmental protection and to prevent mechanical damage because of overstretching. In order to evaluate the influence of segment size and gap size on the occurrence of failure under bending and stretching, so-called 1 st generation flexible and stretchable test samples were designed and prepared. The test samples being considered have hexagonal or square segments (varying in size from 150 to 2000 ?m) being embedded in polyimide. Special tensile and bending test tools were designed and fabricated to in situ observe the occurrence of cracks during loading. An optical microscope with the possibility of recording and analysing the digital images is used for establishing the crack density and width. Experimental and simulation results for the onset of cracking are quite disappointed. It is shown that the first cracks appear in the oxide layers in the gaps in between the silicon segments. The crack density appears to increase rapidly at early stage of loading and subsequently increases slightly. However, the width of the cracks appears to increase steadily during loading. Only at higher (mean) deformations the cracks propagate (or are generated) within the silicon itself. The onset of cracking depends significantly on the silicon segmentation size. The segment size and gap size also affects the crack density and the crack width at larger (mean) deformation levels. There is no crack detected for bending around glass cylinders (even not for the cylinder with the smallest diameter, ?= 2 mm) for samples with a square segment with 450 ?m side length and 120 ?m gap size and for samples with a hexagonal segment with 300 ?m side length and 40 ?m gap size. The remaining bending results show that for other samples with square segments failure always occurs for bending around the glass cylinder with the smallest diameter (?= 2 mm). From the tensile testing {{as well as from the}} simulation results we learned that occurrence of cracks in the oxide layers severely limits the stretchability of the substrates. Because of the early damage initiation found for the 1 st generation samples, a modified design was proposed and worked out. So-called 2 nd generation samples were designed and fabricated with fully segmented polycrystalline silicon segments with flexible aluminium interconnections which are supported by flexible poly-silicon support structures. Again polyimide was used as the embedding material. The samples being considered have varying segment sizes (from 150 to 450 ?m) and varying gap sizes (from 20 to 200 ?m). Various (more or less) sinusoidal interconnections were chosen with various numbers of half waves and various wave amplitudes. When the samples were bent around the (smallest) cylinder with 2 mm diameter, no damage of the segments was detected. Resistance measurements did not show a resistance increase larger than 5 %. Compared to the 1 st generation samples, for tensile testing of the 2 nd generation samples the (mean) strain at onset of failure (which now is segment cracking) is significantly improved. In order to gain more insight into the occurrence of interconnection failures various FE simulations were performed for wave-shaped interconnections of samples with square segments (under stretching only). The local model used is made up from a single gap (of polyimide) with metallic interconnection and poly-silicon support structure in between two embedded segments. Comparison of the experimentally obtained strain values for the resistance change of 5 % and the “sample mean strain” at (assumed) onset of failure, did not give a good match. Apparently the assumed onset of failure, defined by reaching the ultimate strength in the aluminium (that only occurs at some local) is not a good measure for the degradation of the electric conductivity. The “work of plastic deformation” might be better correlated to the change in resistance. The sinusoidal wave interconnection shows the best electrical performance compared to the straight interconnection and the semi-circular interconnection. The influence of wave amplitude, number of half waves and line width of the sinusoidal interconnection is explored. However, the sample mean strain at onset of interconnection failure appears to be limited to a few percents only. From both the experiments and the interconnection FE simulations it is concluded that again insufficient flexibility is obtained for all considered interconnection shapes. It is believed that this is caused by the embedding of the segments and interconnections within the polyimide. For this reason in Chapter 4 embedding in a much softer material is worked out. Also the case of a completely free interconnection (not embedded) is considered (in Chapter 5). In this manner a new concept of future flexible and stretchable substrates is introduced. In the concept of “Future flexible and stretchable substrates I” (Chapter 4), the segments and interconnections are fully embedded into ELASTOSIL RT 601 (a kind of silicone rubber, from now to the whole thesis, the silicone rubber is ELASTOSIL RT 601). Adequate material models for silicone rubber are essential for getting insight into the mechanical behavior of the new design through FE modeling. In particular, FE modeling is used to forecast possible failure. The mechanical properties of silicone rubber were characterized by various methods including tensile testing, cyclic tensile testing and DMA. The ultimate tensile elongation of the silicone rubber foil can reach about 176 % at room temperature. Visco-elastic behaviour of the silicone rubber at room temperature is not relevant. The 3 rd order Mooney model was selected for the constitutive description of the silicone rubber for the FE simulations. Based on the FE simulation results for the “future flexible and stretchable substrate I” it is expected that when increasing the mean sample strain, first the Si support structure will fail and subsequently the silicone rubber will fail during tensile loading. Failure of the Si-segments is likely not to occur at all. Compared to the 2 nd generation substrates, the concept the “future flexible and stretchable substrate I” only gives an improvement of (about) a factor 2 for the main strain level at failure occurrence. The limiting factor for the improvement is the disappointing behavior of the Si-support structure. Apparently, the embedment of the Si-support structure by rubber very much reduces the “spring” behavior of the sinusoidal support structure. Therefore, a major improvement is suggested for the “Future Flexible and Stretchable Substrate II”, by not completely embedding the interconnection by silicone rubber, but only sandwiching this structure between two silicone rubber foils. For the concept of “Future Flexible and Stretchable Substrate II” the aluminum wave interconnections are replaced by copper wave interconnections because the better mechanical and electronic performance of copper. Free-standing interconnection copper lines (without support structures), sandwiched in between silicone rubber sheets, connect the Si-segments. Three types of the interconnections, meander shaped, horseshoe shaped and meshed shaped, were designed with various parameter sets. Simulations for these basic parts were performed to evaluate the influence of the geometric parameters on the flexibility and stretchability. The free-standing interconnection shapes and their geometric parameters have significant influence on the stretchability. From the three types of interconnections being considered, the meander shaped design appears to be most favourable. Compared to the results for the “Future Flexible and Stretchable Substrate I” it can be concluded that an enormous improvement of the stretchability of the interconnect structure is found. It is realized that because of the enormous flexibility of the meander shaped interconnection design, the maximum mean strain of the substrate is limited by the maximum mean strain that other parts can withstand. Here it should be noted that the maximum mean strain of the silicone rubber sheets is limited to about 176 %, or less. With this <b>elongation</b> <b>limit</b> the (found) most favourable meander interconnection (W= 5 ?m, R= 100 ?m and ?= 30 degree) will behave fully elastic and thus will not be damaged, even not under cyclic elongation.

40|$|This project {{investigated}} a miniature, hourglass-shaped actuator (MHA) and how its geometry affects performance. A custom, self-contained, finite-element simulation code predicts {{how each}} MHA deforms when pressurized internally. This analysis describes the MHA geometry's effects on four characteristics: a) work density b) mechanical advantage, c) work advantage and d) percent elongation. The first three characteristics are {{compared to a}} traditional actuator operating {{at the same pressure}} and elongation. A finite-element modeling code was tailored to study the MHA at 5 MPa internal pressure when 1) MHA height and side-wall thickness are constant and side-wall arc length varies; 2) MHA side-wall arc length and thickness are constant and the height varies; and 3) MHA side-wall thickness varies while height and side-wall arc length are fixed. Case 3 was studied using the MHA geometry with the highest work density found in either condition 1 or 2. Peak mechanical advantage, 6. 47, occurs in a constant height MHA-Case 1 -when the side-wall arc length is shortest. Highest elongation, 8. 67 %, occurs in the Case 1 MHA with the longest side-wall arc length. Finally, under Case 3, work density reaches 0. 434 MJ/m 3 when the side-wall thickness is 1. 9 mm. The MHA has potential for active structures because its work density is high-higher than traditional actuators with the same elongation. Their small <b>elongations</b> <b>limit</b> their use; however, much work remains to determine how MHAs might be arranged in a useful array. Never the less, morphing airfoils and other active structures might benefit from embedded MHAs...|$|R

Within the overall process of translation, most identified regulatory processes impinge on the initiation phase. However, recent studies have revealed that the elongation phase can also regulate translation if elongation and initiation occur with specific, not mutually compatible rate parameters. Translation <b>elongation</b> then <b>limits</b> the overall amount of protein {{that can be made}} from an mRNA. Several recently discovered control mechanisms of biological pathways are based on such elongation control. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that determine ribosome speed in eukaryotic organisms, and discuss under which conditions ribosome speed can become the controlling parameter of gene expression levels...|$|R

Preferential {{labeling of}} rDNA fragments by nuclear extracts, in which <b>elongation</b> is <b>limited,</b> indicates that initiation occurs at two positions corresponding to in vivo origins of replication estimated by electron microscopy. Both nuclear and whole plasmodial extracts initiate selectively within a plasmid, pPHR 21, containing {{one of these}} origins. In this plasmid bubbles expand bidirectionally and generate DpnI-resistant DNA. Extracts made at prophase or early S phase, times when the nucleolus is disorganized, are most active in pPHR 21 replication.

25|$|Transcription {{elongation}} is not {{a smooth}} ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription. In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time before resuming transcription. In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5). The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of <b>elongation</b> by <b>limiting</b> the length of time that polymerase pauses.|$|R

Meishan preimplantation conceptuses contain fewer cells, produce less estradiol- 17 β, elongate to a shorter length, and exhibit a reduced placental size throughout gestation than Yorkshire conceptuses. Uterine luminal embryonic estradiol- 17 β and growth factor content are positively associated at elongation. Based on these data, we have argued that growth factor quantity regulates the length an embryo attains at <b>elongation,</b> and ultimately <b>limits</b> placental size.

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} the elongation and orientation of different-sized deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) molecules, tethered onto gold electrodes via a terminal thiol, {{under the influence}} of high frequency ac electric fields. The DNA molecules are elongated from a random coil into an extended conformation and orientated along the electric field lines {{as a result of the}} forces acting on the molecules during the application of the ac electric fields. Elongation was observed in the frequency range 100 kHz- 1 MHz, with field strengths of 0. 06 - 1. 0 MV/m. Maximum elongation for all DNA fragments tested, irrespective of size, was found for frequencies between 200 and 300 kHz. The torque acting on the induced dipole in the DNA molecules, complemented by a directional bias force, opposite in direction to the dielectrophoretic force, provides the main contribution to the elongation process. The length of <b>elongation</b> is <b>limited</b> to either half the distance between opposing electrodes or to the contour length of the DNA, whichever is shorter. Further, the authors show that the normalized length of the elongated DNA molecules is independent of the contour length of the DNA. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Broadband noise may affect controllability of C-Mod plasmas at <b>limit</b> <b>elongations</b> and may become an issue with high-order controllers, therefore two applications of Kalman filters are investigated. A Kalman filter is compared to a state observer based on the pseudo-inverse of the measurement matrix and proves to be a better candidate for state reconstruction for vertical stabilization, provided adequate models of the system, the inputs, the process and measurement noise and an adequate set of diagnostic measurements are available.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{increasing}} consideration has been given to the study of Laser Guide Stars (LGS) for the measurement of the disturbance introduced by the atmosphere in optical and near-infrared astronomical observations from the ground. A possible method for the generation of a LGS is the excitation of the Sodium layer in the upper atmosphere at approximately 90 km of altitude. Since the Sodium layer is approximately 10 km thick, the artificial reference source looks elongated, especially when observed from the edge of a large aperture. The spot <b>elongation</b> strongly <b>limits</b> the performance of the most common wavefront sensors. The centroiding accuracy in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, for instance, decreases proportionally to the elongation (in a photon noise dominated regime). To compensate for this effect a straightforward solution is to increase the laser power, i. e. {{to increase the number of}} detected photons per subaperture. The scope of the work presented in this paper is twofold: an analysis of the performance of the Weighted Center of Gravity algorithm for centroiding with elongated spots and the determination of the required number of photons to achieve a certain average wavefront error over the telescope aperture.

40|$|Accurate {{regulation}} of gene transcription {{is essential for}} organismal survival, and is orchestrated by myriad transcription factors and cofactors (TFs). Little is known about how the intrinsic activity of TFs is controlled. Recent work has indicated that the selective proteolysis of TFs provided by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) {{plays an important role}} in stimulating gene expression through a ‘destruction-activation’ mechanism, whereby the degradation of a ‘used’ TF is thought to stimulate further ‘fresh’ TF binding and reinitiate gene transcription. TFs are targeted to the proteasome via E 3 ligases that mediate the addition of ubiquitin molecules to form a chain on the substrate TF. These polyubiquitin chains may be extended by E 4 ligases, which recognize substrates with four or more ubiquitin molecules, amplifying substrate targeting to the proteasome. In plants the immune response to many pathogens is regulated by the hormone salicylic acid (SA), which operates through the transcriptional coactivator NPR 1 to induce large scale changes in gene expression. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NPR 1 appears to be required for the activation of its target genes. Mutation of the E 3 ligase prevents ubiquitination of NPR 1, leading its to stabilisation and suppression of transcription. Chapter 3 of this work identifies the first E 4 ligase, UBE 4, involved in NPR 1 regulation. Mutation of UBE 4 resulted in reduced capacity to polyubiquitinate substrates and stabilized NPR 1. In contrast to E 3 ligase mutants, however, mutant ube 4 plants displayed increased NPR 1 target gene expression. These results suggest that initial ubiquitination of NPR 1 may stimulate its ability to initiate transcription and that subsequent ubiquitin chain <b>elongation</b> <b>limits</b> NPR 1 activity by targeting it to the proteasome. Chapter 4 describes a ubiquitin-protein-ligase (UPL) which is both novel and crucial to the SA-mediated defence response. Mutation of this UPL leads a large reduction in total cellular polyubiquitinated proteins and was associated with strongly enhanced disease susceptibility. Gene expression profiling of upl mutants revealed an intimate connection between cellular polyubiquitination and appropriate activation of SA-responsive gene expression programmes. Destruction activation was first described in yeast and is required for the {{regulation of}} yeast amino acid synthesis TF GCN 4. GCN 4 requires proteasome-mediated degradation to induce genes involved in amino acid production. Chapter 5 investigates the role of two E 4 ligases in GCN 4 turnover. While one mutation had little effect of GCN 4 -mediated transcription a second increased basal transcriptional levels, suggesting that an E 4 is required for the prevention of spurious GCN 4 -mediated transcription. In summary the work presented here describes cellular mechanisms by which global and substrate-specific polyubiqutination are vital to regulation of gene transcription...|$|R

Bambusa arnhemica was facultatively deciduous, remaining evergreen at a downslope riparian site but suffering total loss of canopy {{on a hillside}} for up to 4 mo during the dry season. Leaf flush was flexible, occurring after as little as 25 turn of rain {{at the onset of}} wet season, in response to unusual dry season storms, and apparently also in response to fire independent of rainfall.

Some growth continued into the dry season, mostly on branches and leaves of new culms at riparian sites. Not all culms completed elongation before the onset of the dry season, and those that did not were permanently stunted. The demands of culm <b>elongation</b> may <b>limit</b> the occurrence of bamboo in wet-dry climates to areas with predictable and sustained wet season rainfall, but the flexibility of branching and leaf processes facilitates coping with, and permits exploitation of less predictable pre- and postmonsoonal rains.
