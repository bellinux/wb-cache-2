40|$|Production data, family labor use, and {{economic}} results are provided for two settled herders in the Northeastern region of Inner Mongolia in China. One was a medium size livestock oriented household residing in a high-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border}} of the Republic of Mongolia, that had 20 cows, 100 female breeding goats and 400 <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>sheep.</b> The other producer household, which resided in a very low-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border of}} Jilin province was small size and communal grazing land based, with 9 cows and 25 adult female goats. The net cash and in-kind income, if only direct costs (essentially out-of-pocket or cash costs) are taken into account, was 14. 5 Yuan per hour of family labor for the medium producer, and 3. 7 Yuan for the small producer. Addition of cost for family labor (using an opportunity cost method) resulted in net income falling slightly, to 12. 8 Yuan for the medium sized producer and 1. 2 Yuan per hour for the small household. 　本稿は，中国内モンゴル自治区北東地域にある 2 つの定住畜産農家により収集されたデータに基づき，その経営状況を比較分析したものである。 2 つの農家のうち 1 つは，高質な草地と農地を有する，モンゴル共和国と隣接する国境地域に居住してある中規模の畜産農家で，計 20 頭の雌牛， 100 頭の繁殖用母ヤギと 400 頭の繁殖用母ヒッジを所有している。もう 1 つは，低質な草地と農地を有する，吉林省と内モンゴル自治区と隣接する地域に居住してある小規模の畜産農家で，共同用の草地を利用して， 9 頭の雌牛と 25 頭成年母ヤギを飼養している。 2 つの畜産農家の純所得（現金収入と現物所得を含む）は，直接費用のみ（原則的に自己負担費あるいは現金支払経費）を計算すれば，中規模の畜産農家においては，家族労働力 1 人当たり時間当たりの所得は 14. 5 元で，小規模の畜産農家のそれはわずか 3. 7 元である。家族労働力の機会費用もコストに加算すれば，その 1 人当たり時間当たりの純所得は，中規模畜産農家では 12. 8 元で，小規模畜産農家では 1. 2 元で，やや減少する...|$|E

30|$|PPR {{disease has}} entrenched itself and became endemic in Turkana County, thus causing cyclic {{outbreaks}} that perpetually result in continuous economic losses to the herders. The losses due to PPR disease that impact on small stock benefits were mainly due to mortality, milk and weight losses. Since the production losses due to PPR were conceived {{to be different}} for different age groups of small stock, herd structures for goats and sheep were established through focused group discussions with Turkana herders, shown in Table  2. Our findings compared well with small stock age structure of a study herd in Turkana reported by Njanja (1991), where adult sheep were 51.5 %, immature 26.4 % and pre-weaned at 22.1 % whereas the adult goats were 51.8 %, immature 21.1 % and pre-weaned 27.2 %. The proportion of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> in <b>sheep</b> and goats (Table  3) was also found to be comparable with Njanja (1991), who reported 36.5 % and 40.6 % for sheep and goats, respectively. In our study, mortalities due to diseases were 70 % and 74.2 % in sheep and goats as established from participatory epidemiology. Other studies in Turkana have reported lower percentages, for example, McCabe (2004) reported 1 % to 50 % losses in small stock due to diseases, de Vries (2002) reported 41 % mortalities in small stock due to various causes, including disease, while Wienpahl (1985) reported 62 % to 68 % losses due to drought and diseases.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the breeding phenology and breeding output {{in relation to}} <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> status in the polygamous Rock Sparrow (Petronia petronia).

Within these clutches, we compared the <b>breeding</b> biology of <b>females</b> that mate monogamously, <b>females</b> that started <b>breeding</b> early with a polygamous male (pri-mary <b>females)</b> and late <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> that chose an already mated male (sec-ondary females). Secondary females produced significantly fewer fledglings than monogamous females and <b>females</b> who started <b>breeding</b> early in a polygamous system. Our results showed that primary females and females mated with a monogamous male were heavier than secondary females. No age effect was detected. Overall, our results indicate that a female’s decision to mate monoga-mously or late in a polygamous systems was probably not independent of her phenotype (body condition) ...|$|R
40|$|Grooming is {{the most}} common form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates that apart from hygienic and hedonistic benefits offers important social benefits for the performing individuals. This study examined grooming behavior in a cooperatively breeding primate species, characterized by single <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> per group, polyandrous matings, dizygotic twinning, delayed offspring dispersal, and intensive helping behavior. In this system, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> profit from the presence of helpers but also helpers profit from staying in a group and assisting in infant care due to the accumulation of direct and indirect fitness benefits. We examined grooming relationships of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with three classes of partners (breeding males, potentially breeding males, (sub) adult non-breeding offspring) during three reproductive phases (post-partum ovarian inactivity, ovarian activity, pregnancy) in two groups of wild moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax). We investigated whether grooming can be used to regulate group size by either ‘‘pay-for-help’’ or ‘‘pay-to-stay’’ mechanisms. Grooming of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males and nonbreeding offspring was more intense and more balanced than with potentially breeding males, and most grooming occurred during the breeding females’ pregnancies. Grooming was skewed toward more investment by the <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males during the phases of ovarian activity, and with potentially breeding males during pregnancies. Our results suggest that grooming might be a mechanism used by female moustached tamarins to induce mate association with the breeding male, and to induce certain individuals to stay in the group and help with infant care...|$|R
