50|$|Gingival crevices are {{the small}} grooves between teeth and gums, {{and they are}} present in health, {{although}} they may become inflamed when gingivitis is present. The difference between a gingival crevice and periodontal pocket is that former is <3mm in depth and the latter is >3mm. Periodontal pockets usually accompany periodontal disease (gum disease). There is some controversy {{over the role of}} periodontal diseases in causing bad breath. However, advanced periodontal disease is a common cause of severe halitosis. Waste products from the anaerobic bacteria growing below the gumline (subgingival) have a foul smell and have been clinically demonstrated to produce a very intense bad breath. Removal of the subgingival calculus (i.e. tartar or hard plaque) and friable tissue has been shown to improve mouth odor considerably. This is accomplished by subgingival scaling and root planing and irrigation with an antibiotic mouth rinse. The bacteria that cause gingivitis and periodontal disease (periodontopathogens) are invariably gram negative and capable of producing VSC. Methyl mercaptan is known to be the greatest contributing VSC in halitosis that is caused by periodontal disease and gingivitis. The level of VSC on breath has been shown to positively correlate with the depth of periodontal pocketing, the number of pockets, and whether the pockets bleed when examined with a <b>dental</b> <b>probe.</b> Indeed, VSC may themselves have been shown to contribute to the inflammation and tissue damage that is characteristic of periodontal disease. However, not all patients with periodontal disease have halitosis, and not all patients with halitosis have periodontal disease. Although patients with periodontal disease are more likely to suffer from halitosis than the general population, the halitosis symptom was shown to be more strongly associated with degree of tongue coating than with the severity of periodontal disease. Another possible symptom of periodontal disease is a bad taste, which does not necessarily accompany a malodor that is detectable by others.|$|E

40|$|Aims: We {{describe}} four associated mandibular teeth, left P 4 – M 3, {{which show}} {{a number of}} features consistent with a diagnosis that toothpick grooves and other dental manipulations were associated with treating multiple eruption abnormalities. Materials and Methods: The four isolated teeth making up Krapina Dental Person (KDP) 20 were analyzed by eye and with a light microscope to document occlusal wear, toothpick groove formation, ante mortem enamel, dentin scratches and lingual fractures. Results: Definitive, stage 4 toothpick grooves (1) occur on all four teeth, but are especially marked on both mesial and distal faces of the left P 4 (tooth # 32) and the mesial face of the left M 1 (tooth # 82). Less distinct interproximal grooves, defined as stage 2 striations, appear on the distal face of left M 1, distal lingual edge of M 2 (tooth # 3) and the mesial face of M 3 (tooth # 8). The left P 4 also shows signs of <b>dental</b> <b>probing</b> on the mesial buccal cusp and all four teeth have fractures on their lingual margins. These features are associated with malpositioned left P 4 and a left M 3 with lingual rotation and a crown that is partially impacted. The M 3 ’s buccal face occupies an occlusal position and shows considerable wear, indicating it was in approximation with the upper dentition. Conclusion: The anomalous dental eruption features of the P 4 and M 3 are associated with several kinds of dental manipulations, which {{seem to have been}} palliative measures to “treat” the dental problems.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} clinical-morphological {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effects of dental probing on occlusal surfaces by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Twenty sound occlusal surfaces of third molars and 20 teeth with initial carious lesions of 17 - to 26 -year-old patients (n = 18) were involved. Ten molars of each group were probed with a sharp <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> (No. 23) before extraction; the other molars served as negative controls. After extraction of the teeth, the crowns were separated and prepared for the SEM study. Probing-related surface defects, enlargements and break-offs of occlusal pits and fissures were observed on all occlusal surfaces with initial carious lesions and on 2 sound surfaces, respectively. No traumatic defects whatsoever were visible on unprobed occlusal surfaces. This investigation confirms findings of light-microscopic studies that using a sharp <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> for occlusal caries detection causes enamel defects. Therefore, dental probing should be considered as an inappropriate procedure and should be replaced by a meticulous visual inspection. Critical views of tactile caries detection methods with a sharp <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> as a diagnostic tool seem to be inevitable in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education programmes.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was the {{construction}} and testing of a CrTmEr:YAG laser for application in photoablative laser surgery. The CTE:YAG laser is a solid state laser emitting at 2. 69 #mu#m. Light of this wavelength shows very good results in ablation of biological tissue and good transmission in conventional quartz fibers even at high intensities. With the constructed CTE:YAG laser head free running operation at 2. 69 #mu#m was realized. The maximum output energy was 70 mJ per pulse at a repetition rate of 1 Hz with an overall efficiency of 0. 07 %. The average laser output power at 5 Hz was 300 mW. For the laser pulse energy a strong dependence on {{the duration of the}} pump pulse was detected. The longest pump pulse for effective pumping was about 180 #mu#s. This was caused by the self termination of the laser transition. An increase of the efficiency has been achieved by changing the host of the laser active Er" 3 "+-ion from YAG to YSGG. Due to a longer life time of the upper laser level the pulse energy could be increased up to 650 mJ by extending the flash-lamp pump pulse. For Q-switching a modulator was designed and constructed. It's operating principle is based on 'Frustrated Total Internal Reflection' (FTIR-Q-switch). The measured transmission is rectangular in its temporal shape with a rise time of about 1 #mu#s. The depth of modulation is 70 % at its maximum. In laser operation the pulse width was 40 - 100 ns. For characterizing the ablation properties of the laser first micromorphological and histological studies on human <b>dental</b> <b>probes</b> and corneal tissue probes of porcine eyes were performed.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the association of maternal periodontitis with low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PB). Materials and Methods: Pregnant women (n =  211) aged 22 – 40 years were enrolled while receiving prenatal care. <b>Dental</b> plaque, <b>probing</b> depth, bleeding on probing, and clinical attachment level were used as criteria to classify three groups: a healthy group (HG; n =  82), a gingivitis group (GG; n =  67), and a periodontitis group (PG; n =  62). At delivery, birth weight was recorded. Results: Mean infant weight at delivery was 3084. 9  g. The total incidence of preterm birth and LBW infants was 10. 4 % and 8. 1 %, respectively. The incidence of LBW infants was 4. 2 % for term and 40. 9 % for preterm gestations. Maternal height was not correlated with infant birth weight (p =  0. 245).

40|$|Carisolv® (MediTeam, Gøteborg, Sweden) is {{a product}} marketed to {{dissolve}} carious dentin thus enabling minimal invasive treatment of dental caries. Studies have reported antibacterial effect {{of the first generation}} of Carisolv. Recently the second generation (Carisolv- 2) was introduced. No information has been published about the antimicrobial effect of Carisolv- 2. Aims: 1. To assess in vitro the in situ antimicrobial effect of the Carisolv- 2 system on the bacteria in carious lesions. 2. To compare the type and quantity of bacteria from non-carious dentin treated by conventional drilling or by the Carisolv- 2 system. 3. To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the Carisolv- 2 gel on selected cariogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four extracted permanent teeth with caries (class I and II) not involving the pulp were collected after the patients’ consent and used in the study. Immediately after extraction and before Carisolv- 2 application, one carious dentin sample was obtained from each of the lesions (samples 1) using slowly rotating sterile round burs. The teeth were then split aseptically in two halves along their long axis and through the middle of the carious lesions. The caries lesions of the two halves (n= 48) were treated either with the Carisolv- 2 system or by conventional drilling using sterile burs. <b>Dental</b> <b>probes</b> and a KaVo DIAGNOdent® laser apparatus were used to assess when caries-free dentin had been reached. Then, non-carious dentin was obtained in a standardized manner by sterile round burs {{from the bottom of the}} cavities after all carious dentin had been removed by drilling (samples 2) or Carisolv- 2 treatment (samples 3). The dentin samples were weighed on a microscale balance and kept frozen in Greave’s medium until cultured aerobically and anaerobically on nonselective (blood agar) and on selective media (MS agar, Rogosa agar and CFAT agar). Although approximately the same volume of dentin was collected for each sample, the weight was slightly different. On an average the weight of the carious dentin samples was 0. 15 mg/ml and that of the non-carious samples 0. 20 mg/ml (p< 0. 01). Total and selective bacterial counts were calculated as colony forming units (cfu) per mg dentin. Bacterial speciation was based on growth on the selective media, biochemical tests for L. acidophilus and A. naeslundi and simple or nested PCR for S. mutans and S. sobrinus. Results: Samples 2 and samples 3 showed significantly (p< 0. 01) lower cfu/mg dentin counts on all culture media than did samples 1. Cfu/mg dentin of samples 3 were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than those of samples 2, a difference most pronounced for anaerobic blood agar counts and CFAT counts. The Carisolv- 2 gel inhibited the growth of all the cariogenic bacteria tested (S. mutans, S. sobrinus, L. acidophilus, A. naeslundi) with inhibition zones in the range of 16. 5 - 35. 0 mm and for A. naeslundi from 32. 0 to 35. 0 mm. Conclusion: Treatment of carious lesions by the Carisolv- 2 system significantly reduced the bacteria in the adjacent non-carious dentin as compared to non-carious dentin obtained from lesions treated by drilling.

To detect DMFT index among the institutionalized elderly. Material and Method. Oral examination was made to make adequate evaluation. A total number of 70 subjects were evaluated. DMFT index has been detected only with <b>dental</b> mirror and <b>probe,</b> without using additional instruments and methods. Results. Average value of DMFT index in our survey was 24. 84 ± 4. 56 (with Confidence interval from 23. 77 to 25. 89). M-component was dominant - 21. 56 ± 7. 79 (with Confidence interval from 15. 74 to 23. 38). D-component indicated by carious teeth and persistent roots had value 2. 60 ± 3. 54 (with Confidence interval from 1. 77 to 3. 42).

30|$|Regarding minimal {{invasive}} tooth preparation, the endpoint of {{caries excavation}} can clinically be defined {{based on the}} hardness of dentin as felt with a <b>dental</b> <b>probe,</b> and also more subjective features such as the colour and moisture of the excavated dentin (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Neves Ade et al. 2011). In an attempt to develop an objective caries-removal procedure, the clinical use of staining agents were included (Fusayama 1993). The clinical and laboratory studies, however, revealed that hard and sound pulpal floors stain more easily because of its lower degree of mineralization {{and it has been}} recommended that light-pink stained tissue should be left in the cavity (Kidd et al. 1989; Yip et al. 1994). In this study, caries removal endpoint was reached when a ‘hard’ cavity floor was felt using dental explorer with a gentle pressure and the caries detector dye was used to guide and limit excavation to caries-infected dentin following excavation in all groups.

40|$|In {{order to}} stop or prevent the {{progression}} of dental disease, early detection and quantification of decay are crucially important. Dental decay (caries) detection methods have traditionally involved clinical examination by eye, using probes and dental radiography, but up to 60 % of lesions are missed. What the dentist requires is a cheap, reliable method of detection of early disease, ideally with information on the depth and rate of growth or healing. Conventional commercial scanning confocal microscopes are unsuitable for use on dental patients. We report on a fibre optic based confocal microscope designed for in vivo examination of caries lesions. The system utilizes a common fibre both as the source and to detect the reflected confocal signal. The initial system has been optimized using dielectric mirrors and {{the thickness of the}} stack has been measured with high precision. Dental samples have been examined and the system has been demonstrated to provide information on the depth and mineral loss of a lesion. Fibre optic microscopy (FOCM) demonstrates a practical route to developing an in vivo caries profiler.

40|$|The caries rate is an {{important}} indicator of dental health but also provides {{a lot of information}} about dietary habits and the lifestyle of past populations. To understand dietary changes, it is important to observe both the primary location and the severity of caries lesions. In the present study the prevalence, location and severity of caries lesions were recorded on 5, 838 teeth of six skeletal populations from Estonia, from the Migration Period (450 – 600 AD) to the Early Modern Times (18. c.). Scoring of the presence and location of caries was done visually {{with the aid of a}} <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> in all the observable teeth. The majority of dental caries appeared at the cemento-enamel junction, or the appositional surfaces in all the groups. The frequency of caries as well as the severity of lesions increased gradually from the Migration Period to the Early Modern Period. No severe caries lesions (to the pulp) were registered in the Migration Period, and in the Early Modern Times 27 % of caries lesions were penetrating to the pulp chamber. These differences in the frequency and the pattern of caries distribution show possible dietary and subsistence differences between groups. The distribution, as well as the overall prevalence of cavities, suggest that in later periods the diet was probably more cariogenic and less abrasive...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Analysis of macromorphological and ultrastructural tooth {{characteristics}} of osteological {{material from the}} medieval site of St. Pantaleimon Church in Niš provides us with insight on the life, nutrition and habits of medieval population, {{as well as the}} structure and composition of their teeth. Objective. The aim of this research, based on the tooth inspection of skeletal remains from the medieval site of St. Pantaleimon Church in Niš, was to analyze macromorphological characteristics, ultrastructure of the dental tissue of maxillary and mandibular molars, canines and incisors, as well as their chemical composition. Methods. Macromorphological and ultrastructural analysis of the dental tissue of osteological material dating from the 12 th century included 1312 teeth with advanced abrasion. Macromorphological changes were detected by using a <b>dental</b> mirror, <b>probe</b> and radiography. After irrigation, the teeth were prepared using the standard procedure and analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (JEOL-JSM- 5300). Chemical analysis was done by expanded downscaling (EDS) method for Mg, P, Ca. Results. The analysis detected second degree abrasions of all teeth in individuals aged 20 - 25 years. Third and fourth degree abrasions of teeth were detected in individuals aged over 40 years. Ultrastructural analysis showed a complete obliteration of dentin tubules and pulp of the lower incisors, the apposition of intratubular dentin inside the tubules, as well as extensive deformity and loss of dentin structure on molars with preserved pulp volume and nerve fiber calcification. The calcification of nerve fibers showed that the formation of intratubular dentin was proportional with the biological potential of pulp and the degree of abrasion, and inversely proportional with the size of dentin surface. Chemical analysis showed that in the analyzed teeth Ca composition was slightly lower than that in the control group, P composition was almost identical, while Mg composition was multiply increased in comparison to the control group consisting of today’s persons of matching age and examined teeth as the medieval individuals. Conclusion. Different ultrastructural tooth characteristics {{as a part of the}} complex masticatory system of the medieval man are the result of individual and the whole community adaptation to actual living conditions. Nerve fibers calcification of the pulp can explain the absence of pain despite the high level of dental abrasion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background No {{evidence}} about {{damage caused by}} ball-ended probes on tooth is available. No study compared probing defects caused by ball-ended probes with sharp explorers during tactile examinations of primary teeth. This exploratory study aimed to compare ultrastructural defects caused by ball-ended probes with sharp explorers during tactile examinations of primary teeth. Methods Forty-nine primary extracted teeth were tactile examined as performed for caries activity assessment. Surfaces were randomly divided into groups based on probe type (ball-ended probe or sharp explorer). Two examiners probed different surfaces using the sharp explorer and the ball-ended probe. The order for examination was randomly determined. Images were captured using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) before and after probing. Two external examiners evaluated independently the ESEM images and scored them as: 0) no damage, 1) slight marks, 2) distinct marks, 3) marks with discontinuity, 4) enamel break-offs. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to analyze associations between probing ultrastructural damage and surface type, baseline condition and probe type. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with 95  % confidence interval (CI). Results The most common defects observed on the <b>dental</b> surfaces were <b>probing</b> marks without discontinuity (scores 1 and 2). Ball-ended probes caused significantly less severe damage than sharp explorers (PR: 0. 28; CI: 0. 11 – 0. 76, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusion Ball-ended probes cause less damage than sharp explorers when <b>probing</b> gently <b>dental</b> surfaces of primary teeth...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{periodontal}} condition of an adult population in three isolated regions in Greece and to determine the association of periodontal disease with several demographic, behavioral and environmental factors. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 640 individuals, aged 20 to 69 years from three isolated regions. The following indices were assessed: Pocket Depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), Dental Plaque, Calculus and Bleeding on Probing (BOP). Statistical analysis was accomplished by multiple linear regression model which was used to assess the association between the mean clinical attachment loss and clinical, demographic and behavioral parameters. Results: The samples of the study showed high levels of dental plaque, dental calculus and BOP. The final multivariate model showed that age (p= 0. 000), gender (p= 0. 016) and presence of calculus (p= 0. 000) were associated with the mean clinical attachment loss. Age (p= 0. 000), gender (p= 0. 000) and dental plaque (p= 0. 027) were associated with gingival recession, while age (p= 0. 018) and gender (p= 0. 000) were associated with probing depth. Bleeding on <b>probing,</b> <b>dental</b> plaque, toothbrush frequency, level of education, tobacco consumption and reasons for dental visits were not associated with the mean clinical attachment loss. Conclusion: Periodontal disease consists of a complicated destructive condition of the Periodontal tissue with a. multi-factorial etiology. Oral hygiene instructions and a regular dental follow-up could play a significant role in the prevention of periodontal disease. Key Words: Periodontal Disease; Epidemiology; Risk Factor...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the prevalence, types, location, {{and characteristics of}} enamel defects in anterior permanent teeth of patients with complete unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate, {{as well as the}} relation with the cleft. Setting: Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil. Participants: Eighty patients of both genders, 12 years and older, with unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate. Methods: A single examiner carried out clinical examination under artificial light with a <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> and mirror after drying teeth according to the modified DDE index. Results: Seventy-four of 80 patients presented with at least one tooth affected by enamel defects: 165 of 325 evaluated teeth (50. 8 %) presented enamel defects, with hypoplasia being the most prevalent (50. 7 %), followed by diffuse opacity (23. 1 %) and demarcated opacity (18. 4 %). The most affected tooth was 21 (36. 5 %), followed by 11 (34 %), located at the middle (40 %) and incisal (33 %) thirds. Most defects occur at the buccal surface (47. 7 %), followed by the distal (22. 7 %), the mesial (19 %), and the palatal (10. 6 %) surfaces. A significant relationship was found between the cleft side and enamel defects. Conclusion: Upper anterior teeth of patients with complete cleft lip and palate present a high prevalence of enamel defects; the highest percentage on the cleft side suggests that the cleft does influence the occurrence of enamel defects in permanent teeth...|$|E
40|$|Lesion {{detection}} aids ideally aim {{at increasing}} {{the sensitivity of}} visual caries detection without trading off too much in terms of specificity. The use of a <b>dental</b> <b>probe</b> (explorer), bitewing radiography and fibre-optic transillumination (FOTI) have long been recommended for this purpose. Today, probing of suspected lesions {{in the sense of}} checking the 'stickiness' is regarded as obsolete, since it achieves no gain of sensitivity and might cause irreversible tooth damage. Bitewing radiography helps to detect lesions that are otherwise hidden from visual examination, and it should therefore be applied to a new patient. The diagnostic performance of radiography at approximal and occlusal sites is different, as this relates to the 3 -dimensional anatomy of the tooth at these sites. However, treatment decisions have to take more into account than just lesion extension. Bitewing radiography provides additional information for the decision-making process that mainly relies on the visual and clinical findings. FOTI is a quick and inexpensive method which can enhance visual examination of all tooth surfaces. Both radiography and FOTI can improve the sensitivity of caries detection, but require sufficient training and experience to interpret information correctly. Radiography also carries the burden of the risks and legislation associated with using ionizing radiation in a health setting and should be repeated at intervals guided by the individual patient's caries risk. Lesion detection aids can assist in the longitudinal monitoring of the behaviour of initial lesions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the Prevalence of Dentin Hypersensitivity (DH) among adult patients in Bangalore city, India and to suggest most appropriate clinical method to diagnose dentin hypersensitivity. Methodology: All adult patients attending the outpatient Department of the Oxford Dental College in Bangalore were considered for the study. Patients with sensitivity were subjected to detailed intra oral examination and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. All the teeth were tested for Evidence of dentin hypersensitivity by the use of air blast & water from the air-water jet syringe and by scratching the suspected tooth surfaces with a <b>dental</b> <b>probe.</b> The responses of each tooth ofthe subjects were recorded on the visual analog scale (VAS). Results: An overall prevalence of dentin hypersensitivity was 6. 4 %. About 86. 8 % patients perceived their experience of dentin hypersensitivity as sharp and 13. 2 % patients experienced it as dull, cold acted as the common stimulant. Premolars and molars were the most commonly affected teeth, maxillary arch have higher number of sensitive teeth compared to mandibular arch. DH was more elicited on the occlusal surface followed by cervical surfaces of the teeth. The perceived response of DH on VAS scale showed a significant difference among the methods (p< 0. 001) with probe method eliciting the highest response on the VAS scale followed by the air for 10 seconds. Conclusion: The prevalence of DH among adult population of Bangalore city was 6. 4 %. Probe was considered as most appropriate method to diagnose Dentin Hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare caries status {{assessment}} of posterior teeth of young Chinese adults by using clinical examination alone {{and with the}} supplemental use of bitewing radiographs. Methods: Two calibrated dentists examined the posterior teeth of 200 Chinese university students (aged 18 - 24 years) using <b>dental</b> mirrors and <b>probes</b> under optimal lighting. Caries was diagnosed by visual detection of carious cavities. Duplicate examinations were performed to monitor intra- and inter-examiner variations. Bitewing radiographs were taken and examined by an independent dentist. Caries was recorded when a lesion extended into dentine. Results: Among the 3, 162 posterior teeth examined, 113 were detected with caries. More than one third (35. 4 %) of the caries found in the posterior teeth was not detected from reading the radiographs but was detected by clinical examination. About half (51. 4 %) of the caries {{was found on the}} bitewing radiographs only, leaving 13. 2 % being detected by using either method. With the supplement of bitewing radiographs, there was a 105 % {{increase in the number of}} carious lesions detected. This leads to a correction factor of 1. 13 for adjustment of the mean DMFT score obtained from conducting clinical examinations alone. Conclusion: Due to the significant number of clinically undetected carious cavities in these young Chinese adults who live in a community with water fluoridation, it may be advisable to use a correction factor to adjust the caries experience obtained from epidemiological surveys when bitewing radiographs are not available. © 2008 FDI/World Dental Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Caries or {{tooth decay}} {{regardless}} of the good knowledge {{of the nature of}} the disease and the possibility of its effective prevention is still the most widespread disease in our population. It also very often threatens the functions of organs and even the entire organism. Health culture is an integral part of general culture and health education plays an important role in maintaining health of individuals. Aim. The main objective of this study is to determine the influence of oral health behaviour of schoolchildren aged 12 to 14 on their oral health. The schoolchildren attended the seventh and eight grade at Drago Milovic Elementary School in Tivat. Method. The survey was conducted during the period from the end of January to April 2015 at Drago Milovic Elementary School in Tivat. It comprised all seventh and eight-graders that were at school those days. The survey instrument was a questionnaire specially designed for this study and it consisted of 36 closed-ended questions. Clinical examination of oral health in children was used as an additional research instrument. Assessment of oral health was carried out under natural light with <b>dental</b> mirror and <b>probe</b> according to WHO recommendations. The parameter used to assess the state of oral health was DMFT index — the number of carious, extracted and filled teeth. In addition, the assessment of oral hygiene was conducted using soft debris index according to Green-Vermillion which determines absence or presence, quantity and distribution of dental plaque and other soft deposits. Results. The majority of students stated that they lack knowledge regarding the effectiveness of fluoride toothpaste (69. 4...|$|R
40|$|Session - Oral Health ResearchOBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the oral health and oral hygiene habits of Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong who had cerebral palsy. METHODS: Students aged 12 years or above studying in three special schools of the Hong Kong Spastic Association were invited for this study. Parental consent was obtained and medical history of the subjects was checked before the examination. They were examined in the schools using <b>dental</b> mirrors, CPI <b>probes</b> and an intra-oral fiber-optic light. Information on the subject's oral hygiene habits was collected in an interview. RESULTS: From the 89 children invited, 65 (36 boys and 29 girls) participated in this survey. Their mean age was 15. 0 ± 2. 0 years. Most of them, 74 %, were spastic. About half (49 %) had mild mental retardation and 29 % were moderately retarded. They all practiced daily toothbrushing and about one third used mouthrinse. None of the surveyed students had healthy gum {{and more than half}} (57 %) had calculus. Only one-third of them had caries experience in their permanent dentition and the mean DMFT score was 1. 2 ± 1. 9. No significant differences in caries experience were found between boys and girls, and between those who were mentally retarded and those who were normal. CONCLUSION: The caries experience of the Hong Kong adolescents with cerebral palsy was not high but their oral hygiene and periodontal health status was unsatisfactory. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 21 st International Association for Dental Research (Southeast Asia Division) & 18 th Southeast Asia Association for Dental Education (SAADE) Annual Scientific Meeting, Bali, Indonesia, 6 - 8 September 2007...|$|R
