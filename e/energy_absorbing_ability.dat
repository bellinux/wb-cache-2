40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the constant stress amplitude compression compression fatigue behavior of closed cell aluminum foam, both with and without lateral constraint, was conducted. Results show that while {{the early stages of}} strain accumulation due to fatigue loading are independent of constraint, the rapid strain accumulation stage behaviors are sensitive to the constraint. This was ascribed to the noticeable hardening with plastic deformation observed under constraint during quasi static loading, which in turn reduces the effective maximum stress experienced by the foam specimen during fatigue loading. This was demonstrated through a simple empirical model that connects fatigue strain accumulation without constraint to that under constraint. Complementary X ray tomography experiments suggest that the fatigue behavior of the foams is relatively less sensitive to morphological defects such as missing walls than the quasi static mechanical properties such as plastic strength. Evaluation of the energy absorption behavior suggests that the damage that accumulates during fatigue does not affect the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>ability</b> of the foam adversel...|$|E

The materials studied included Vita VMK 68 body porcelain, Optec HSP body porcelain, Dicor, IPS- Empress castable ceramics, Vitadur N core porcelain and In-Ceram core porcelain. Alumina reinforced materials (In-Ceram core) resulted in the highest fracture toughness values followed by Vitadur N core porcelain. IPS-Empress and Optec HSP materials showed moderate but statistically significant (P 0. 0001) greater values compared to conventional feldspathic porcelain Vita VMK 68 and a control soda-lime-silica glass.

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a great deal of}} interest in the possibility of modifying photosynthetic parameters to improve photosynthesis, specifically with the aim of increasing crop yields for food and biofuels. Photoinhibition, the reduction of photosynthetic electron transport in the face of excess irradiance, is thought to contribute significantly to loss of photosynthetic yield and is therefore an area of particular interest in this respect. Photoinhibition is a function of photoprotective mechanisms acting to dissipate excess <b>absorbed</b> light <b>energy,</b> and of photodamage to photosystem II due to the limitations of those mechanisms. The efficiency of photosynthetic light use, i. e., both the amount of light <b>energy</b> <b>absorbed</b> and the <b>ability</b> to use or dissipate it effectively, is dependent on the tailoring of the photosynthetic apparatus to the lighting environment. Such tailoring is achieved by monitoring the redox status of the plastoquionone pool, which serves as an indicator of photosynthetic electron transport. The work in this dissertation seeks to produce a better mechanistic understanding of how light intensity, as sensed by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, signals photoprotective and acclimative responses of the light harvesting apparatus, and particularly how these responses are integrated with one another...|$|R

40|$|Bird strike {{issues are}} known to cause {{substantial}} losses to the civil aviation industry in terms of damage and delay every year. Rules of bird strike resistance are included in many important regulations and guidelines of civil aviation. Based on these rules, attentions should be paid during the design and analysis process for those structures that might be apt to suffer from bird strike as leading edge, radar dome, wind shield and vertical tail. This paper describes a new software infrastructure for bird-strike design and analysis. The bird-strike resistance synthetic analysis platform is a platform that incarnates new research and innovations in bird-strike dynamic strength analysis of our research group. The platform was implement using finite element method and parametric design method based on ESI Pam-crash software, and involves a dynamic performance database of the typical aviation material, a typical structure database for bird-strike resistance, a post-processing modular for result reveal, and an estimation modular for energy absorbing. The material database covers the key constitutive model constants for many common aviation materials. Different bird model for Lagrange, Euler, and SPH algorithm are also covered to fit for different impact speed simulation. The typical structure database are very helpful to the designers because it provides the parametric model of some special bird-strike resistance structures to improve the <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>ability</b> subject to impact.

30|$|Rockburst {{ultimately}} {{leads to}} the sudden violent dynamic failures of roadway or coalface, of which 87  % (Pan et al. 2013) occurs in the roadway. Therefore, it is of direct significance for the control of rockburst by inhibiting the failure of roadway and coalface through support means. As for rockburst-resisting roadways, the support system should be capable of resisting high burst dynamics, providing appropriate pressure yielding deformation, and owning a flexibility that can play a buffering and energy-absorbing role (Gao et al. 2009). Bolt has become a reasonable supporting mean due to its initiative, pressure yielding ability, <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>ability,</b> and the capability in utilizing the bearing capacity of surrounding rocks (Gao et al. 2009; He et al. 2010). However, bolt support technology can only resist the rockburst under certain intensity. As for high-energy rockburst, energy absorbing materials are needed to consume part of the tremor energy to stabilize the support system (Lv et al. 2011). On this basis, Pan and Lv et al. (Pan et al. 2011; Lv and Pan 2012) proposed a structure model of rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support which was composed of surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and steel bracket (rigid-flexible-rigid). In essence, the model {{is similar to the}} strong–soft–strong structure model (Gao et al. 2008). The surrounding rocks, energy absorbing materials, and steel bracket are equivalent to the externally strong large structure, middle soft structure, internally strong small structure respectively. Theoretically basing on the model above, the rigid-flexible energy-absorbing support system (Liu et al. 2013) was developed. It is a three-level support system composed of three parts, namely, the bolt-mesh-cable support, the O-type roof support made of energy absorbing materials and U-type steels (simply called as O-type roof support), and the rigid burst-resisting bracket. The energy absorbing materials lay between the bolt-mesh-cable support and O-type roof support. This support system was implemented in Yuejin Coal Mine of Henan Dayou Energy Co., Ltd., China, and effectively avoided roadway damages, equipment damages, and casualties when high-energy rockburst occurred.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 56 - 57) This paper {{analyzes the}} impact of a hockey puck against a circa 1999 ice hockey chest protector used by a goaltender and then improves the design by changing materials and shapes used. For the analysis, it is assumed that the puck has an initial velocity of 85 mph, the collision is elastic, and the impact is in a single direction orthogonal to the chest protector. The theory behind a chest protector, as well as other types of protective equipment, is to distribute {{the impact of}} an object over a larger surface area. This performance needs to be balanced by factoring in size and weight. Smaller, less bulky equipment can increase the goaltender's mobility as well as reduce muscle fatigue. Initially, the compressive properties of the cunent design were determined and used to derive the amount of energy absorbed by the pieces bending and deflecting during impact by doing analysis using energy methods, treating the masses as viscoelastic bodies, and the pad as a simply supported beam. A new design was developed in a solid modeling package using concepts seen in other industries and had its compressive modulus determined by plotting stress and strain values derived from an embedded Finite Element Analysis (FEA) package. These values were then used in the calculations performed on the original design to show performance improvements comparing results of the viscoelastic analysis, which was determined to be the best approximation of the equipment's performance. The best design iteration of the new design showed a reduction in performance of 1. 90 % using the exit velocity as the metric for its <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>ability.</b> However, the new design provided a reduction in both thickness and weight by 59. 4 % and 37. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A number of simultaneous interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) were investigated with regard to morphology and <b>energy</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>ability.</b> The materials were all based on polyurethane (PUR) with the second polymer components being polystyrene (PS) or poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA). Also, three-component IPNs were synthesised. This was achieved by incorporating functionalised PS latex particles into a PUR/poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) IPN. The morphology of the IPNs was determined with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy and modulated-temperature differential scanning calorimetry (M-TDSC). The mechanical properties were investigated using tensile testing and hardness measurements. The PUR/PS IPNs {{were found to be}} grossly phase separated at every composition, even when crosslinked at very high levels. However, a structural modification of the materials was conducted by introducing inter-network grafting, compatibilisers and ionic interactions. All three structure modifications proved successful in achieving a finer morphology. By conducting a stirred synthesis, a very complicated morphology with a very high and broad transition was obtained. The PUR/PEMA IPNs were semimiscible and the 70 : 30 composition exhibited a very broad, almost rectangular, transition as evidenced by DMTA data. Phase domains between I - 500 run were found by TEM. The degree of mixing and, thus, the location and breadth of the transition could be adjusted by varying the composition and the crosslink densities in both networks. Also, variation of the chemical nature of the PUR soft and hard segments proved successful in obtaining a broad transition range. Materials with a controlled microheterogeneous morphology which exhibited excellent energy absorbing characteristics were developed. PUR/PEMA IPNs generally exhibited better damping properties as indicated by the area under the linear loss modulus (LA) and· loss factor (TA) curves. Some of these materials exhibited values for the loss factor of >- 0. 3 spanning a temperature range of more than 170 °C. The study of IPN s containing latex' particles revealed promising results. Further concentrating on this approach might yield damping materials with even broader energy absorbing temperature/frequency ranges...|$|E

Secondly, the synthesis procedure was modified by changing the order of nanoclay mixing with homopolymer components. All lPN composites were based on a composition ratio of 70 PU/ 30 PEMA, 5 wt% C 20 A content, 1. 2 wt% of PU catalyst and 30 min mixing time. High intensity ultrasonic waves were also introduced in the nanoclay mixing step for one hour. However, the ultrasonication showed only a marginal change in damping properties. Finally, a number of other nanoclays were incorporated into the 70 PU/ 30 PEMA IPN. All IPN composites achieved only a partial intercalation, except for the C 30 B-filled lPN where no changes were revealed by W AXD. All nanoclays caused a decrease in the glass transition of both homopolymers. IPN nanocomposites tended to reveal a higher extent of phase separation with increased clay content, but only the Na clay-filled lPN still showed a broad loss factor value, even at higher clay content. Improved modulus of elasticity was shown by all nanoclays, with increased clay loading. Whereas a moderate increase in the tensile strength was only shown at 1 wt% clay content.
