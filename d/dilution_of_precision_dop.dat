40|$|Relative {{positioning}} with GNSS {{is generally}} used to achieve precise {{positions in the}} frame of critical applications (surveying, photo-control [...] .). On this basis, we have developed a software which allows to compute a positioning error due to the ionosphere only using reference stations belonging to the Belgian Dense Network (BDN). This network consists in 66 GPS (dual-frequency) receivers over the whole Belgium. The drawback of this method is that this computation needs the design matrix which contains coefficients depending on satellite constellation geometry. Therefore, like for absolute positioning, a poor geometry (evaluated by the <b>Dilution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precision,</b> or <b>DOP)</b> can also lead to large positioning error that cannot be separated from the one due to ionospheric effects, and in particular the small-scale structures. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} build a similar index to DOP for relative positioning in our software to be able to separate the ionospheric effects from the geometric ones. The final step is to study the feasability of a service for users of relative positioning using the BDN.

40|$|Abstract—Location {{service is}} {{essential}} for many sensor network applications. This paper theoretically assesses the accuracy of range-based localization schemes with respect to network connectivity and scale in sensor networks where sensors are deployed and connected randomly. We first show that the variance of localization errors are proportional to average geometric dilution of precision (AGDOP). We then prove a novel lower bound of expectation of AGDOP (LB-E-AGDOP) and derives a closed-form expression that relates LB-E-AGDOP to only three parameters that describe network connectivity and scale. Furthermore, the paper conjectures a simple relationship between the expectation of AGDOP (E-AGDOP) and its lower bound, LB-E-AGDOP. The closed-form expressions of LB-E-AGDOP and E-AGDOP are used to analyze how accuracy evolves when the network scales up. Finally, we validate the theoretical results via numerical simulations.
