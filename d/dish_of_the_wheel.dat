5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total <b>dish</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle spindle. Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|E
50|$|A wheel, {{mirror and}} a light {{can be used to}} {{visualize}} real and imaginary described in this equation. The mirror is placed at a 45 degree angle above <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> so that you can see the front and top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> at <b>the</b> same time. The light is attached to <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> so that you can see <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> when <b>the</b> room lights are turned off. You sit directly in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> while a friend rotates <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (real) and <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> (imaginary) tell you <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
