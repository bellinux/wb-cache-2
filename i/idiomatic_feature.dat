40|$|The article {{proposes that}} a {{construct}} I call the Dasian space provides an effective framework to interpret harmonic aspects of scale relations in twentieth-century polymodality, {{particularly in the}} music of Bartók. Based on Bartók’s intuition that the pitch space modeled after his notion of polymodal chromaticism retains integral “diatonic ingredients,” the Dasian space (named after the medieval homonymous scale) establishes a system of relations between all potential diatonic segments, without relying upon traditional constraints, such as complete diatonic collections, harmonic functions, or pitch centricity. The Dasian space is a closed, nonoctave repeating scalar cycle, where each element is identified by a unique coordination of pitch class and modal quality. The dual description of each element enables both the specification of location in a given cycle {{and the emergence of}} a group structure, whose generators—named transpositio and transformatio—are also characteristic musical motions and relations. The proposed analytical methodology is probed in a couple of short pieces of Bartók’s Mikrokosmos and in the third movement of his Piano Sonata. The article argues that, unlike other tonal and atonal classic approaches, the Dasian framework enables the analyst to reconcile the constructional character of a Bartókian <b>idiomatic</b> <b>feature</b> (the combination of distinct and integral scale strata) with the interpretation of harmonic space in terms of scale-segment interaction and formal processes. The article then contextualizes the structure of the Dasian space within a larger class of constructs, which I call affinity spaces, by generalizing some of its group-theoretical properties that model relations between nondiatonic scalar materials. The analytical pertinence of affinity spaces is probed in Bartók’s “Divided Arpeggios,” an intriguing posttonal piece appearing late in the Mikrokosmos set...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{language}} of advertising and within that the idioms and idiomatic meanings appearing in it. After the study of idioms – which, being a complex linguistic field, needs a deeper look – I will define ads, give a short insight into the history of advertising and explain the controversy about the nature of advertising. Then I will deal with the core topic of this thesis, which is the language of ads and further similarities between the nature of ads and idioms. The thesis will conclude with case studies. With all this I attempt to reveal that, although advertising has a disputed place in society, there is a great need for it to inform people and give hints for socialization primarily with its language, the main force of advertising, to which force many idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> contribute with their vigorous, expressive nature more strongly than the visual elements.

5000|$|Vaughan Williams {{studied with}} Ravel {{for three weeks}} in Paris in 1908. Though he worked chiefly on orchestration, this was to provide quite a {{contrast}} to the Germanic tradition handed down through Stanford and Parry at the RCM, and perhaps began to give Vaughan Williams a greater sense for colour and a freedom to move chords as block units. His partiality towards mediant relationships, a unifying harmonic motive of A Sea Symphony, may have been somewhat liberated by these studies, and this harmonic relationship is now considered symptomatic of his style in general. A Sea Symphony also makes use of both pentatonic and whole tone scales, now often considered <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> of French music of the period. Almost certainly, this music was in Vaughan Williams’ mind as he finished work on A Sea Symphony in 1908-1909, but Ravel paid him the great compliment of calling him “the only {{one of my students}} who does not write my music.” ...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{recordings}} {{embody the}} material traces of legendary performers {{from the past}} and can offer an inspirational resource for modern interpreters. Despite limitations, early recordings can provide a rich and reliable source of information for the performer-scholar. This article is an empirical investigation of Edvard Grieg’s performance style from the historical recordings of two of his Lyric Pieces: ‘Butterfly’, Op. 43 No. 1, and ‘To the Spring’, Op. 43 No. 6. First, taking a bottom-up approach and starting from the composer’s recordings, salient gestures in Grieg’s performance style are traced using empirical techniques of beat-tempo analysis. Second, exploratory Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to compare the composer’s timing profiles to those of other pianists in the sample. Results show that Grieg’s extreme flexibility in performance tempo distinguishes him from other interpreters. Specifically, the rhythmic pull of the principal motif in ‘Butterfly’, Op. 43 No. 1, and the rhetorical inflection of the melody in ‘To the Spring’, Op. 43 No. 6, appear to be <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> of Grieg’s style...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is in one part to observe the {{evolution}} of the wind octet genre and another to research the evolution of the bassoon's role in this ensemble. Specifically the essential role of the two bassoons are revealed by showing that they are the only pair of instruments that remain intact in the wind octet ensemble from the time of Mozart to the time of Stravinsky. Because of this, they provide the wind octet it's characteristic sound. To illustrate these points, two significant wind octets were examined in detail: The Serenade in Eb, K. 375 (1782) by Mozart and the Octet for Winds (1923 /revised 1952) by Stravinsky. Despite the long time span between these two works, and the obvious changes in instrumentation, the Octet for Winds by Stravinsky could be called an evolved version of the earlier traditional wind octet. The research within illustrates how the writing for the bassoons changed and stayed the same as related to range, articulation, technical demands, interaction and blending, <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> and role between the years of 1782 and 1923. Other octets that fall between these dates were examined to demonstrate this evolution. Also, in order to have a better understanding of the Serenade by Mozart and Octet for winds by Stravinsky, their symphonic works were analyzed to determine how each composer wrote for the bassoon in other genres and this is compared to the use of the bassoon in their octets...|$|R
40|$|In {{theories}} {{dealing with}} tonality in Norwegian and Scandinavian folk music, {{there has been}} a special focus on the assumed “old-agey” non-diatonic intervals, also referred to as floating or neutral intervals or blue notes. In {{the first part of the}} 20 th century, the search for typical Norwegian scales came into focus. Explanations of the origin of non-diatonic intervals differ. Catharinus Elling and O. M. Sandvik refers to cultural processes, while others, like Erik Eggen and Eivind Groven finds the origin of the tonal preferences in physical, nature-given conditions and theories about acoustics. Thus, until recently, there seem to be an agreement regarding a seven note octave-equivalent scale system. Some scientists have been describing the tonality in terms of formulas and modes, like Liv Greni’s article about the lullaby tradition in Setesdal. The Swedish scholars Sven Ahlbäck and Johan Westman focus on how intonation of intervals is close connected to melodic formulas. This concerns an important point; do an assumed scale or mode represent anything autonomous by traditional players or singers, or is this only something scholars / educated musicians make theories and abstractions about? There have been only a few attempts of quantitative approaches on the field. Hampus Huldt-Nystrøm’s effort to describe diversity between Norwegian and Swedish tonal languages is one example, and later Bjørn Aksdal, with the support of a computer-aided method, have tried to describe historical layers within fiddle music, where tonal matters were among the variables. With a few exceptions, <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> of the fiddle instruments do not seem to be focused on in discussions about tonality...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Hons)) [...] Macquarie University, School of English Studies, 1972. Bibliography: leaves 353 - 358. The {{subject of}} this thesis is Broad Norfolk, which refers to that variety of speech used for {{communication}} between Norfolk Islanders in informal social situations. Previous research on the language has been mainly limited to lexical observations. This study covers a considerably wider area of investigation, viz. description of the phonology and grammatical structure of Norfolk and {{an assessment of the}} historical affiliations of its main features. [...] . The analysis of Norfolk phonology is based on impressionistic evidence, with support from an acoustic study of vocalic nuclei. The statistical values of stressed vowels are compared with those of Cultivated Australian. The quality of weakly stressed vowels and Norfolk consonants is also considered. Study of prosodic phenomena, such as syllabication, stress and reduplication habits is restricted to what was required by the description of Norfolk vowels. [...] . Definition of the Word Classes of Norfolk precedes the formal description of its grammar. Since Norfolk expresses its grammatical relationships by syntax rather than morphology, the determination of Word Classes reveals the basic level of its grammar. This section also permits comment on important <b>idiomatic</b> <b>features</b> of the language. In the formal treatment of structures, Independent and Dependent Clauses, Phrases and Word level constructions are described according to tagmemic procedures. The historical section of the thesis begins with a linguistic history of Pitcairn and Norfolk Islands; it estimates which individuals, attitudes and events most influenced the character of their languages. This chapter discusses such related subjects as the reason for Pitcairnese and Norfolk remaining so stable throughout their history, the probable circumstances under which Pitcairnese developed, and the relationship between Norfolk and creole languages. [...] . Historical connections are then shown more precisely through description of the development of English and Tahitian vowels and consonants in Norfolk, and through relation of English dialects, Tahitian and creole languages to the structural features of Norfolk. [...] . The Glossary serves as as illustration and extension of the sections preceding it. It contains all Norfolk vocabulary forms and meanings which are known to the author but which do not exist in Standard English; etymological comment is included for most items. Part of the function of the Glossary is to show, in summary, those forms which are local innovations and those which have been preserved from eighteenth century British dialects and Ancient Tahitian.

40|$|In this paper, I {{present a}} case study on the tool-mediated {{refactoring}} process and its effects, in terms of software metrics and performance, on an educational video game. The game is Museum Assistant: Design an Exhibit, which was released in May 2012 by an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate students. The game was developed for the Web in C# using Unity 3 D and MonoDevelop. The team set out to apply the principles of Clean Code throughout {{the development of the}} game. However, late in the development cycle, the team knowingly abandoned methodological constraints in the face of production stress. For this study, I began a six-week refactoring period comprising two phases: the first was mediated by the popular automated refactoring tool ReSharper, and the second involved manual identification of SRP violations. ReSharper's static analysis tools identified over 900 design problems, 95 % of which were resolved in refactoring. In my analysis, I discuss how ReSharper simplified the detection and removal of superficial design defects such as naming convention violations, scope limitations, and <b>idiomatic</b> language syntax <b>features,</b> but it was not able to identify larger design flaws such as opportunities for design patterns. The details of one particular pattern-based refactoring are introduced in order to illustrate the relative merits of tool mediation and manual inspection: the introduction of a Chain of Responsibility. Code metrics, as computed by Visual Studio, were tracked throughout the refactoring process in order to estimate changes in readability and maintainability. I identify lines of code, readability index, class coupling, and cyclomatic complexity for extended discussion; all of these metrics improved through the refactoring process.
