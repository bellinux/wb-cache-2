25|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks {{during the course of}} the construction was a rock excavation work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long concrete beam weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands extension line. The entire Woodlands extension line consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> installed at the entrance of each station.|$|E

2500|$|Photothyristors are {{activated}} by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. [...] Since no <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> need to be provided at {{the potential of the}} thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. [...] Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; [...] they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.|$|E
2500|$|The main art on {{the land}} side of the airport is Alexis, {{consisting}} of six steel sculptures in stainless steel created by Per Inge Bjørlo. On the air side, Carin Wessel used [...] of thread to make the impression of clouds and webs, named Ad Astra. Anna Karin Rynander and Per-Olof Sandberg cooperated in making two installations: The Marathon Dancers, located in the baggage claim area, {{is a set of}} two <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> that show a dancing person. Sound Refreshment Station, of which six are located in the departure areas, are sound [...] "showers" [...] that make refreshing sounds when a person is immediately under them. Sidsel Westbø has etched the glass walls. In the check-in area, there are small boxes under the floor with glass ceilings that contain curiosities. As well as the custom-made art, several existing sculptures and paintings have been bought. At the National Road 35 and European Route E6 junction, Vebjørn Sand has built a [...] statue named the Kepler Star. It consists of two internally illuminated Kepler–Poinsot polyhedrons, appearing like a giant star in the sky after dark.|$|E
