40|$|Virtual {{microscopy}} {{involves the}} conversion of histological sections mounted on glass microscope slides to high-resolution digital images. Virtual microscopy offers several advantages over traditional microscopy, including remote viewing and data sharing, annotation, and various forms of data mining. We describe a method utilizing virtual microscopy for generation of internet-enabled, high-resolution brain maps and atlases. Virtual microscopy-based digital brain atlases have resolutions approaching 100, 000 dpi, which exceeds by three or more orders of magnitude resolutions obtainable in conventional print atlases, MRI, and <b>flat-bed</b> <b>scanning.</b> Virtual microscopy-based digital brain atlases are superior to conventional print atlases in five respects: (1) resolution, (2) annotation, (3) interaction, (4) data integration, and (5) data mining. Implementation of virtual microscopy-based digital brain atlases is located at BrainMaps. org, {{which is based on}} more than 10 million megapixels (35 terabytes) of scanned images of serial sections of primate and non-primate brains with a resolution of 0. 46 μm/pixel (55, 000 dpi). The method can be replicated by labs seeking to increase accessibility and sharing of neuroanatomical data. Online tools offer the possibility of visualizing and exploring completely digitized sections of brains at a sub-neuronal level and can facilitate large-scale connectional tracing, histochemical, and stereological analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Significant {{reduction}} in both strength and durability of concrete is {{brought about by}} voids left within the concrete once it has hardened. These voids can arise {{from a number of}} sources both intentional, in the case of air-entrained voids introduced by admixtures batched to provide a structure that can withstand frost attack and unintentional in the case of entrapped voids that arise due to characteristic of the sand and aggregates, excess water added and a lack of consolidation whilst plastic. Aggregate form, shape and texture are known to influence the way particles pack together and therefore the amount of space left between and amongst the particles. The second phase of this study has used desktop <b>flat-bed</b> <b>scanning</b> to record aggregate profiles, both raw particles and aggregate shape profiles taken from the curved surface of core samples, to classify the shape and then provide a protocol for defining the shape. This study has shown the photographs provided originally in Concrete Society Technical Report 11 and now recently re-introduced into the UK Annex of BS EN 12504 - 1 : 2009 Testing concrete in structures - Core specimens - Taking, examining and testing in compression, provide a misrepresentation of the curved surface of the core. A curved surface cannot be recorded faithfully by a 2 D camera image. An accurate representation of the curved surface of concrete core samples has been obtained by the use of conventional desktop scanners, albeit using relatively high image resolution. By a novel yet simple modification, concrete core samples have been mechanically rolled above a modified flatbed desktop scanner driven by the crosshead so as to align directly above the cold cathode fluorescent (CCF) light source and the scanning charged coupled cross-head image recording device. A method of assessing the amount of void age found within the curved surface of concrete core samples has been developed. A freely distributed software programme was used to process all images to determine percentage voidage and voids size distribution among other attributes. A second freely available statistics software package has been used to analyse the results. The second phase of the study has used the same scanning technique to classify 2 D aggregate profile as used for voidage shape recognition taken from the curved surface of core samples. Three simple shape factors have been used, one developed specifically for this study. By means of Riley Circularity, Percentage Concavity and Aspect Ratio core surface aggregate profiles, raw aggregate shapes and voidage found on core samples have been classified. The objective being to determine if the aggregate within a sampled concrete has changed from that intended, possibly due to crushing oversize material or just changes within the source that would provide a means of assessing any influence aggregate shape change may have had on entrapped voidage and the effect that has had on the strength of the concrete. Scanner performance and calibration has been checked using high resolution calibration sheets. The image resolution was found to be accurate to 2. 5 % at 0. 5 mm diameter when scanned at 1200 dpi. This enabling the threshold to be investigated between entrained and entrapped air voids so as to allow discrimination between any combinations of the two found on a core sample. The equipment, equipment modifications, procedures, test protocols as well as the imaging software and statistical analyses packages included in this study have been chosen so as to allow others to utilise the benefits such analyses offers. The recent acceptance and drive to recycle materials for use as construction aggregate can benefit from classification by these procedures that until now have not been included in any published Standards. The procedures developed during this study have been published in the Magazine of Concrete Research, Dec 2010 and presentations given by invitation to joint meetings of the Concrete Society/Institute of Concrete Technology at Loughborough and in London, 2011.

50|$|Large format {{photography}} {{is not limited}} to film; large digital camera backs are available to fit large format cameras. These are either medium-format digital backs adapted to fit large format cameras (sometimes resulting in cropped images), step and repeat Multishot systems, or scanning backs (which scan the image area {{in the manner of a}} <b>flat-bed</b> scanner). <b>Scanning</b> backs can take seconds or even several minutes to capture an image. When using a Sinar Macroscan unit and 54H data files, over 1 gigabyte of data is produced.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new algorithm for non-rigid registration capable of estimating a constrained dense displacement field from multi-modal image data. We applied this algorithm to capture non-rigid deformation between digital images of histological slides and digital <b>flat-bed</b> <b>scanned</b> images of cryotomed {{sections of the}} larynx, and carried out validation experiments to measure {{the effectiveness of the}} algorithm. The implementation was carried out by extending the open-source Insight ToolKit software. In diagnostic imaging of cancer of the larynx, imaging modalities sensitive to both anatomy (such as MRI and CT) and function (PET) are valuable. However, these modalities differ in their capability to discriminate the margins of tumor. Gold standard tumor margins can be obtained from histological images from cryotomed sections of the larynx. Unfortunately, the process of freezing, fixation, cryotoming and staining the tissue to create histological images introduces non-rigid deformations and significant contrast changes. We demonstrate that the non-rigid registration algorithm we present is able to capture these deformations and the algorithm allows us to align histological images with scanned images of the larynx. Our non-rigid registration algorithm constructs a deformation field to warp one image onto another. The algorithm measures image similarity using a mutual information similarity criterion, and avoids spurious deformations due to noise by constraining the estimated deformation field with a linear elastic regularization term. The finite element method is used to represent the deformation field, and our implementation enables us to assign inhomogeneous material characteristics so that hard regions resist internal deformation whereas soft regions are more pliant. A gradient descent optimization strategy is used and this has enabled rapid and accurate convergence to the desired estimate of the deformation field. A further acceleration in speed without cost of accuracy is achieved by using an adaptive mesh refinement strategy...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial {{atmospheric}} pressure {{chemical vapour deposition}} (cAPCVD) was used to synthesise a film with mixed gradating phases from pure orthorhombic pseudo-brookite Ti 3 -δO 4 N (0. 06 < δ < 0. 25) to interstitial N-doped anatase TiO 2 on a single film. This {{is the first time}} such a mixed graduating system has been reported. The film was characterized via Raman mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Film thicknesses were determined by Swanepoel method manipulations of UV-visible reflectance spectra and side-on scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using a novel <b>flat-bed</b> digital <b>scanning</b> technique, the photocatalytic activity of the film to dichloroindophenol (DCIP) degradation under 365 nm light was also mapped. This allowed for the systematic investigation on the effect of pseudo-brookite: interstitial N-doped anatase phase composition, indicating pseudo-brookite to be the more photocatalytically active material. Films synthesized by the cAPCVD route analysed in conjunction with mapping analysis tools is a shortcut to identifying numerous phases and compositions and their functional property relationships on a single film, offering a rapid method for analysis of phase-space...|$|R
40|$|An {{intelligent}} ink, previously {{shown to}} be capable of rapidly assessing photocatalytic activity, was simply applied via a felt-pen onto a commercially available piece of Activ self-cleaning glass. The ink, comprising of redox dye resazurin and the sacrificial electron donor glycerol within an aqueous hydroxy ethyl cellulose (HEC) polymer media, was photocatalytically degraded in a two-step process. The key initial stage was the photo-reductive conversion of resazurin to resorufin, whereby a colour change from blue to pink occurred. The latter stage was the subsequent photo-reduction of the resorufin, where a slower change from pink to colourless was seen. Red and green components of red-green-blue colour extracted from flat-bed scanner digital images of resazurin ink coated photocatalytic films at intervals during the photocatalysis reaction were inversely proportional to the changes seen via UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and indicative of reaction kinetics. A 3 x 3 grid of intelligent ink was drawn onto a piece of Activ and a glass blank. The photocatalysis reaction was monitored solely by <b>flat-bed</b> digital <b>scanning.</b> Red-green-blue values of respective positions on the grid were extracted using a custom-built program entitled RGB Extractor. The program was capable of extracting a number of 5 x 5 pixel averages of red-green-blue components simultaneously. Allocation of merely three coordinates allowed for the automatic generation of a grid, with scroll-bars controlling the number of positions to be extracted on the grid formed. No significant change in red and green components for any position on the glass blank was observed; however, the Activ film displayed a homogenous photo-reduction of the dye, reaching maxima in red and minima in green components in 23 +/- 3 and 14 +/- 2 min, respectively. A compositionally graded N-doped titania film synthesised in house via a combinatorial APCVD reaction was also photocatalytically tested by this method where 247 positions on a 13 x 19 grid were simultaneously analysed. The dramatic variation in photocatalysis observed was rapidly quantified for all positions (2 - 3 hours) allowing for correlations to be made between thicknesses and N : Ti% compositions attained from Swanepoel and WDX analysis, respectively. N incorporation within this system was found to be detrimental to film activity for the photocatalysis reaction of intelligent ink under 365 nm light...|$|R
