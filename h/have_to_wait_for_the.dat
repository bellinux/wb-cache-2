25|$|Nephila display large sexual size {{dimorphism}} with females being greatly {{larger than}} males, sometimes {{up to ten}} times the size. There is debate as to {{whether this is a}} result of male dwarfism or female gigantism. Smaller males may be selected for due to the presence of competition for mating. Smaller males are quicker and more nimble, allowing {{them to be able to}} catch the females more easily as well as escape when threatened. Larger males may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> female to come close due to their slower speed. Larger females may have been selected for as a result of males using mating plugs upon copulation. Larger individuals reduce the success of these plugs, allowing for multiple mating and reducing the risk of genital mutilation. Gigantism in females is also associated with fecundity, larger individuals can produce more eggs and therefore increase reproductive success.|$|E

25|$|SQL Server buffers {{pages in}} RAM to {{minimize}} disk I/O. Any 8KB page can be buffered in-memory, and {{the set of}} all pages currently buffered is called the buffer cache. The amount of memory available to SQL Server decides how many pages will be cached in memory. The buffer cache is managed by the Buffer Manager. Either reading from or writing to any page copies it to the buffer cache. Subsequent reads or writes are redirected to the in-memory copy, rather than the on-disc version. The page is updated on the disc by the Buffer Manager only if the in-memory cache has not been referenced for some time. While writing pages back to disc, asynchronous I/O is used whereby the I/O operation is done in a background thread so that other operations do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> I/O operation to complete. Each page is written along with its checksum when it is written. When reading the page back, its checksum is computed again and matched with the stored version to ensure the page has not been damaged or tampered with in the meantime.|$|E

500|$|The game's combat {{focuses on}} velocity, and {{encourages}} players to defeat enemies in a fast-paced way. As a result, players can employ different moves including wall running, air-dashing, zip lining, performing parkour, acrobatics, and water traversal. Players use grind rails to deftly navigate city streets, {{and are able}} to switch direction instantly at will. The city is also filled with items for players to bounce up into the air. Players may utilize their weapons while performing these movements and slow down time for players to take aim. On-foot, players cannot walk, take cover, or take out enemies silently, but instead must rely on agility to survive as they will be overwhelmed quickly by enemies if they choose to walk on the ground. The game also features a Style Meter. Shown in the head-up display (HUD) of the game, the Meter increases as players perform stylish moves like killing enemies and grinding on-rails without touching the ground. When players are killed, they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game to load. Players can respawn and return to the world by different methods, such as descending with a rocket or exiting a golden sarcophagus. Insomniac named this system [...] "Next-Gen Respawning".|$|E

2500|$|The Anacostia {{station has}} been used several times for {{experiments}} in improving Metrorail's operations. In July 1997, Anacostia was one of five Metrorail stations used to test a premium monthly parking fee which would guarantee the purchaser a spot at the station's parking garage. The $50-a-month pass {{was the most popular}} at Anacostia, and the pricing scheme was expanded throughout the Metro system in March 1998. Although Metro reserved on 15 percent of all spaces for such parking at most stations, at Anacostia this was raised to 25 percent. In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency call box system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations. When Metro established a carsharing program with Flexcar in 2001, the Anacostia station was one of 12 Metrorail stations at which the system was tested. Metro also tested its [...] "Next Bus" [...] real-time information system (designed to let riders know how long they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bus) at Anacostia and four other Metrorail stations. Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale. Metro relaunched the system in June 2009, and once more Metrobus [...] "Next Bus" [...] signs were activated at Anacostia and two other pilot Metrorail stations. When Metro announced a pilot program in the spring of 2006 to encourage food and other vendors to sell goods in Metrorail stations, Anacostia was one of 12 stations chosen for the test. The program stalled due to cleanliness, safety, and other concerns, but was reinvigorated in 2009, and Anacostia was one of three Metrorail stations chosen again to experiment with the initiative. When Metro adopted the SmarTrip fare care program the same year, Anacostia was one of three stations chosen to experiment with SmarTrip fare gate express lanes. The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes. Anacostia was also one of six parking garages and lots where Metro experimented with accepting credit card payments rather than SmarTrip cards in 2007. Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.|$|E
