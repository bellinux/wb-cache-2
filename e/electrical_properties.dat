40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>property</b> {{evolution}} of a metallic film deposited on polyethylene terephthalate substrate during tensile deformation Mei-yu Chen 1, Kan Lai 2, Runjun Sun 1 and Hong-tian Fang 1 The <b>electrical</b> <b>property</b> {{evolution of}} a metal/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) composite during tensile deformation was theoretically analyzed in this work. It {{was found that the}} resistance variation of a metal/PET composite during tensile deformation falls into two parts: before a crack appearance and after a crack appearance. Before a crack appears on the coated metal layer, the resistance variation complies with Ohm’s law. After that, the resistance variation of the metal/PET composite, on the whole, correlates with the elongation rate of the metal/PET composite in an exponent relation. In addition, the resistance variation of the Al/PET composite during tensile deformation was tested for verifying the correctness of the theoretical analysis.

From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors.

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by <b>electrical</b> <b>properties</b> that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and <b>electrical</b> <b>properties</b> of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and {{recording}} devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity {{can be made}} using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{diamonds}} {{have very}} few if any nitrogen impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, which account for ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see <b>Electrical</b> <b>properties).</b> Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
