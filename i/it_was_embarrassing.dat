25|$|Cleese {{was born}} in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, {{the only child of}} Reginald Francis Cleese (1893–1972), an {{insurance}} salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (née Cross; 1899–2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. When he was 13, he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College, an English public school in Bristol. He was already more than 6feet (1.83m) tall by then.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about cunnilingus, where Madonna compares her vaginal fluids to holy water, juxtaposing Christian imagery with sexuality. [...] "Holy Water" [...] divided music critics; some deemed it a {{standout}} {{and one of}} the most scandalous tracks of Madonna's career, while others felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and over the top. The song was included on the set list of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). The performance contained dancers dressed as nuns, the singer gyrating around the cross while standing on a dancer and a reenactment [...] of the Last Supper. It was target of controversies in Singapore, where Madonna excluded it from the setlist and was criticized by the Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|... "One, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and, two, it made {{me think}} about quitting," [...] said Hill. [...] "While Coppola's {{intentions}} were honorable, I think he made a bad situation worse. I didn't do anything for a year. I was fortunate enough that I could buy my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{should be}} glad to see you," [...] Mrs. Colston broke in hurriedly; [...] "but, with Mr. Jernyngham at the homestead, wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing?</b> Muriel, we really can't wait." ...|$|R
50|$|Izumi is a {{cold and}} distant shinigami {{assigned}} to the Pediatrics Ward. He can transform into an anthropomorphic dog plushie, but rarely does so because {{it takes a lot}} of energy and he says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> He likes to call other characters by nicknames.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015 the Church of England {{admitted}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to <b>be</b> paying staff under the living wage. The Church of England had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount. The archbishop acknowledged <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not the only}} area where the church [...] "fell short of its standards".|$|R
2500|$|While in Boston, Jackson faced money {{troubles}} as {{he spent}} nine {{years trying to}} rescue a bankrupt radio station, which he took over and converted into a gospel station. Difficulties resulted from extended legal battles with the Federal Communications Commission. In 1993, Jackson was forced to enter bankruptcy protection. Of the bankruptcy filing, Jackson said, [...] "It was painful. It was difficult. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> I don't {{like the idea of}} not paying off debts." [...] The protracted battles with the FCC contributed to his belief that the government unreasonably interferes in the free market.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than the}} disapproval {{of all the}} four states of the new expert {{committee}} that was proposed, the proposal {{turned out to be}} a major embarrassment for the tribunal. [...] This was because, not only were the four states opposed to it even the Chief Judge of the tribunal was opposed to it. [...] However the other two assistant judges on 3-man adjudication team, overruled the opinion of the main Judge. [...] And all this was done in a packed courtroom and this led to petty bickering and heated arguments between the three judges in the packed courtroom. [...] This left everyone in the courtroom shocked and the Tamil Nadu counsel was moved to remark that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> that the judges probably needed help settling their own disputes before adjudicating on the dispute at hand. [...] Nonetheless, the new expert committee was formed and carried out further assessments. [...] Subsequently, the extended deadline of the tribunal also passed and the tribunal was given yet another extension.|$|E
60|$|Honor durst not ask {{the grounds}} of this prediction, {{and the rest of}} that family were discussed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to be asked about the reports of last winter, and Lucy's keen {{penetration}} soon led to full confidence.|$|E
60|$|Quite a {{crowd had}} collected, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> growing <b>embarrassing</b> for Alf Davis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Agatha, {{with some}} hesitation, [...] "in a way, it hurts very much. I don't mean that it's {{embarrassing}} {{to take your}} help, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> You see, I felt I must find the lode myself; it's my duty, and you have taken away the satisfaction I might have felt. Besides, you cheated me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} a guest of honor myself, and I know what Mr. Carnegie <b>is</b> {{experiencing}} now. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to get compliments and compliments and only compliments, particularly when he knows {{as well as the}} rest of us that on the other side of him there are all sorts of things worthy of our condemnation.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy and Molly {{were looking}} at each other in silence. From the {{expression}} on their faces, his lordship gathered that his existence had once more been forgotten. He saw her hold out her hands to Jimmy, and {{it seemed to him that}} the time had come to look away. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for a chap! He looked away.|$|E
60|$|My uncle {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} {{as if to say}} that it was useless to argue with a woman's tantrums. The hussar and I made as if we would stroll away, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to stand listening to such words, but in her fury she called to us to stop and be witnesses against him. Never have I seen such a recklessness of passion as blazed in her dry wide-opened eyes.|$|E
6000|$|She {{brought out}} this droll {{explanation}} {{with a little}} nervous rush, {{as if she were}} speaking words she had got by heart. They gave me an impression of subtlety and at first I failed to follow. But after a moment her face helped me to see further, and then a light came into my mind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and I bent my head over Jeffrey Aspern's portrait. What an odd expression was in his face! [...] "Get out of it as you can, my dear fellow!" [...] I put the picture into the pocket of my coat and said to Miss Tita, [...] "Yes, I'll sell it for you. I shan't get a thousand pounds by any means, but I shall get something good." ...|$|E
5000|$|Joshua Dratel, {{one of the}} {{officers}} of the Project, defended the actions of the attorneys saying “If you get information in the public record, it doesn’t become classified just because the government feels <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing</b> or that they would prefer you not to show it to anyone. There is no prohibition on gathering public-source information and showing it to your client.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your language, Signore," [...] {{observed}} Andrea Barrofaldi, with warmth, [...] "is {{no doubt}} a very noble one, for the language in which Shakespeare and Milton wrote cannot be else; but you will permit {{me to say that}} it has a uniformity of sound, with words of different letters, that I find as unreasonable as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to a foreigner." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{were glad}} {{that he was too}} young to take heed of the change, or to see what was implied by his change from [...] "baby," [...] to [...] "my lord," [...] and we always called him by his Christian name. Mrs. Rowe felt far too much for us to gossip to him, and he was always with her or with me, though I do believe he liked Ben--the great, rough, hind--better than anyone else; would lead Mrs. Rowe long dances after him, to see him milk the cows, and would hold forth to him at dinner, in a way as {{diverting}} to us as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to poor Ben, who used to blurt out at intervals, [...] "Yoi, my lord," [...] and [...] "Noa, my lord," [...] while the two maids tried to swallow their tittering. The farmers at market used to call Fulk, [...] "my lord," [...] by mistake, and then colour up to their eyes through their red faces.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} the {{bungalow}} and fetched my rifle. Flourishing it in a sanguinary manner and scowling fearsomely, I charged upon the invaders. The little girl fled, screaming, to {{the shelter of the}} pines, but the woman calmly went on picking. She took not the least notice. I had expected her to run at sight of me, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> There was I, charging down the field like a wild bull upon a woman who would not get out of the way. I could only slow down, supremely conscious of how ridiculous it all was. At a distance of ten feet she straightened up and deigned to look at me. I came to a halt and blushed to the roots of my hair. Perhaps I really did frighten her (I sometimes try to persuade myself that this is so), or perhaps she took pity on me; but, at any rate, she stalked out of my field with great composure, nay, majesty, her arms brimming with orange and gold.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for the girl. She was all {{too well}} aware of the {{difference}} between her home and the home of her schoolmates and friends, She. knew that it was not pleasant for her [...] "Yankee" [...] friends to come to visit her when they could not feel sure of a welcome from the tireless, silent, and grim-visaged old Norse, if, indeed, they could escape insult. Julia ate her food mechanically, and it could hardly be said that she enjoyed the brisk talk of the young man, his eyes were upon her so constantly and his smile so obviously addressed to her, She rose as soon as possible and, going outside, took a seat on a chair under the trees in the yard. She was not a coarse or dull girl. In fact, she had developed so rapidly by contact with the young people of the neighborhood that she no longer found pleasure, in her own home. She didn't believe in keeping up the old-fashioned Norwegian customs, and her life with her mother was not one to breed love or confidence. She was more like a hired hand. The love of the mother for her [...] "Yulyie" [...] was sincere though rough and inarticulate, and it was her jealousy of the young [...] "Yankees" [...] that widened the chasm between the girl and herself--an inevitable result.|$|E
5000|$|When Witmer Stone, then {{editor of}} The Auk, {{commented on the}} taxonomic {{confusion}} that the bird caused during less than 25 months after its description, he noted:"It would seem desirable that those who name fossil birds should not fashion their generic names on those of existing birds as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to find them shifted into other families or orders where the name becomes somewhat of a misnomer!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Dragon {{calls him}} [...] "Floppy Hat" [...] and [...] "Jingle-Boy". Jester has an {{interesting}} Roman name. Gunther thinks <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> One day he will reveal {{his name to}} Jane.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Butteridge, {{it became}} evident, {{was a man}} {{singularly}} free from any false modesty--indeed, from any modesty of any kind--singularly willing to see interviewers, answer questions upon any topic except aeronautics, volunteer opinions, criticisms, and autobiography, supply portraits and photographs of himself, and generally spread his personality across the terrestrial sky. The published portraits insisted primarily upon an immense black moustache, and secondarily upon a fierceness behind the moustache. The general impression upon the public was that Butteridge, was a small man. No one big, it was felt, could have so virulently aggressive an expression, though, {{as a matter of}} fact, Butteridge had a height of six feet two inches, and a weight altogether proportionate to that. Moreover, he had a love affair of large and unusual dimensions and irregular circumstances and the still largely decorous British public learnt with reluctance and alarm that a sympathetic treatment of this affair was inseparable from the exclusive acquisition of the priceless secret of aerial stability by the British Empire. The exact particulars of the similarity never came to light, but apparently the lady had, in a fit of high-minded inadvertence, had gone through the ceremony of marriage with, one quotes the unpublished discourse of Mr. Butteridge--"a white-livered skunk," [...] and this zoological aberration did in some legal and vexatious manner mar her social happiness. He wanted to talk about the business, to show the splendour of her nature in the light of its complications. It was really most embarrassing to a press that has always possessed a considerable turn for reticence, that wanted things personal indeed in the modern fashion. Yet not too personal. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> I say, to be inexorably confronted with Mr. Butteridge's great heart, to see it laid open in relentlesss self-vivisection, and its pulsating dissepiments adorned with emphatic flag labels.|$|E
6000|$|May 3. Sunday. Fifteen {{or twenty}} Africanders who will end their voyage to-day and strike for their several homes from Delagoa Bay to-morrow, sat up singing on the afterdeck in the {{moonlight}} till 3 A.M. Good fun and wholesome. And the songs were clean songs, {{and some of them}} were hallowed by tender associations. Finally, in a pause, a man asked, [...] "Have you heard about the fellow that kept a diary crossing the Atlantic?" [...] It was a discord, a wet blanket. The men were not in the mood for humorous dirt. The songs had carried them to their homes, and in spirit they sat by those far hearthstones, and saw faces and heard voices other than those that were about them. And so this disposition to drag in an old indecent anecdote got no welcome; nobody answered. The poor man hadn't wit enough to see that he had blundered, but asked his question again. Again there was no response. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for him. In his confusion he chose the wrong course, did the wrong thing--began the anecdote. Began it in a deep and hostile stillness, where had been such life and stir and warm comradeship before. He delivered himself of the brief details of the diary's first day, and did it with some confidence and a fair degree of eagerness. It fell flat. There was an awkward pause. The two rows of men sat like statues. There was no movement, no sound. He had to go on; there was no other way, at least none that an animal of his calibre could think of. At the close of each day's diary, the same dismal silence followed. When at last he finished his tale and sprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of laughter, not a ripple of sound resulted. It was as if the tale had been told to dead men. After what seemed a long, long time, somebody sighed, somebody else stirred in his seat; presently, the men dropped into a low murmur of confidential talk, each with his neighbor, and the incident was closed. There were indications that that man was fond of his anecdote; that it was his pet, his standby, his shot that never missed, his reputation-maker. But he will never tell it again. No doubt he will think of it sometimes, for that cannot well be helped; and then he will see a picture, and always the same picture--the double rank of dead men; the vacant deck stretching away in dimming perspective beyond them, the wide desert of smooth sea all abroad; the rim of the moon spying from behind a rag of black cloud; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing a zigzag path through the fields of stars in the deeps of space; and this soft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in the midst of it and told his poor little tale and felt so lonesome when he got through.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{response}} to a student's question about how his own religious faith affected his philosophy of government at the University of Pittsburgh in November 2011, Biden said, I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way.|$|R

5000|$|He was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for people with a disability. He came out strongly against Australian sport administrator Arthur Tunstall who stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to have disabled athletes at the 1994 Commonwealth Games.

5000|$|Jim McCarty's {{comment on}} the LP: [...] "None of that stuff was ever {{intended}} to be released.
