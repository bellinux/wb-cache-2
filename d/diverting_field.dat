The squadron operations officials had underestimated the urgency of the situation, and placed undue emphasis on returning the pilot to his home field, having in mind the pilot's familiarity with that base, the longer runway, and better repair resources.|$|R

40|$|The edge {{bootstrap}} current plays {{a critical}} role in the equilibrium and stability of the steep edge pedestal plasma. The pedestal plasma has an unconventional and difficult neoclassical property, as compared with the core plasma. It has a narrow passing particle region in velocity space that can be easily modified or destroyed by Coulomb collisions. At the same time, the edge pedestal plasma has steep pressure and electrostatic potential gradients whose scale-lengths are comparable with the ion banana width, and includes a magnetic separatrix surface, across which the topological properties of the magnetic field and particle orbits change abruptly. A driftkinetic particle code XGC 0, equipped with a mass-momentum-energy conserving collision operator, is used to study the edge bootstrap current in a realistic <b>diverted</b> magnetic <b>field</b> geometry with a self-consistent radial electric field. When the edge electrons are in the weakly collisional banana regime, surprisingly, the present kinetic simulation confirms that the existing analytic expressions [represented by O. Sauter et al., Phys. Plasmas 6, 2834 (1999) ] are still valid in this unconventional region, except in a thin radial layer in contact with the magnetic separatrix. The agreement arises from the dominance of the electron contribution to the bootstrap current compared with ion contribution and from a reasonable separation of the trapped-passing dynamics without a strong collisional mixing. However, when the pedestal electrons are in plateau-collisional regime, there is significant deviation of numerical results from the existing analytic formulas, mainly due to large effective collisionality of the passing and the boundary layer trapped particles in edge region. In a conventional aspect ratio tokamak, the edge bootstrap current from kinetic simulation can be significantly less than that from the Sauter formula if the electron collisionality is high. On the other hand, when the aspect ratio is close to unity, the collisional edge bootstrap current can be significantly greater than that from the Sauter formula. Rapid toroidal rotation of the magnetic field lines at the high field side of a tight aspect-ratio tokamak {{is believed to be the}} cause of the different behavior. A new analytic fitting formula, as a simple modification to the Sauter formula, is obtained to bring the analytic expression to a better agreement with the edge kinetic simulation result...|$|R

One of the major sources of water is the Hill Torrents which emerges from the {{mountains}} and <b>diverted</b> towards Agriculture <b>fields</b> for irrigation. Due to steep gradient, flood flows with high velocity which results in damaging to standing crops, irrigation system, houses, roads and sometime human lives also. The flood of hill torrents {{having a lot of}} potential for agriculture to meet the shortage of food if manage wisely. Dera Ghazi Khan (D. G.

40|$|A {{computer}} model {{for use in}} predicting the impact of various improvement options on command area expansion of a deep tubewell irrigation system has been developed. A field study was conducted on 11 selected deep tubewells located at two sites, namely Dhamrai and Thakurgaon, in Bangladesh to collect necessary physical data to provide irrigation engineering insight and a basis for testing and application of the model. The {{results of the investigation}} revealed that the actual discharge of most of the deep tubewells was lower than the design or rated capacity. The duration of pump operation in the majority of the study deep tubewell areas was extremely low. The conveyance losses in all of the study systems were very high. Even though a portion of those losses was reused in the system, particularly in rice growing areas, they caused serious difficulty in delivering water to remote fields, thus, restricting the command area. The overall irrigation efficiencies in all of the wheat growing areas of Thakurgaon were low. Considerable losses and waste of water after it was <b>diverted</b> from the <b>field</b> channels due to lack of leveling and poor water control were mostly responsible for the low efficiencies. Excessive percolation losses due to inadequate puddling of the soils during land preparation and frequent drought conditions resulted from poor distribution of water in some of the rice growing areas of Dhamrai caused relatively low overall irrigation efficiencies. The overall efficiencies of the pumps both driven by diesel engine and electric motor were found to be much lower than the recommended values. The developed model was applied to predict the expected command area under both existing and modified physical conditions. The model predicted command areas were compared with the actual field observed values and necessary adjustments were discussed. The impact of each of the improvement alternatives considered in the study was determined by comparing the predicted command area under the modified conditions with that under the existing physical settings. An economic analysis was performed to determine the cost effectiveness of most of the alternatives. Application of the model in evaluating the farmers 2 ̆ 7 pump operation practices was demonstrated. Use of the model to assist the farmers in planning the command area and delivery schedule was also indicated.

40|$|Three active thermal methods {{capable of}} {{detecting}} surface breaking cracks in metals are considered in this Thesis. The three thermal methods exploit different means of excitation, each with practical advantages and varying abilities to detect {{specific types of}} crack morphology. Thermosonics uses a broadband, high power ultrasonic input to vibrate the test-piece. Defects damp the vibrational energy into heat which is imaged by a thermal camera. Laser-spot thermography uses a short laser pulse to spot heat {{the surface of the}} test-piece, and the subsequent radial heat diffusion is then observed. Defects can cause both increased emission of infrared and localised increases in thermal impedance, both effects causing distortion of the radial heat diffusion. Eddy-current induced thermography uses a high power magnetic field to induce a flow of current inside the test-piece. Defects create a localised increase in electrical impedance, <b>diverting</b> the electric <b>field</b> around the defect. This diversion of current flow causes neighbouring regions of high and low current density, the corresponding Joule heating imaged by a thermal camera. In this Thesis the three methods are explored experimentally. For laser-spot thermography and eddy-current induced thermography the physical phenomena are characterised and experimental best-practice for short pulse excitation determined. The effect of crack opening on each of the three methods is found to give insight into which applications the methods are most suited. It was found that the relationship between crack opening and detectability was complex for thermosonics, relatively linear for laser-spot thermography, and that eddy-current induced thermography is largely insensitive to crack opening. The methods are tested for the feasibility of detecting cracks in Inconel buried beneath metallic and ceramic coatings typical of gas turbine blades, with thermosonics and eddy-current induced thermography found to be viable methods. A study of the detectability {{of a large number of}} cracks in steel, titanium and Waspaloy by eddy-current induced thermography is detailed, and from this data the probability of detection is established. Eddy-current thermography is shown to be an extremely sensitive method capable of detecting fatigue cracks of approximately 0. 25 mm in steel and 0. 50 - 0. 75 mm in titanium and Waspaloy. The practicality of the thermal methods is discussed, and the methods put into the context of the wider field of NDE. Based on the works in this Thesis it was found that for most applications eddy-current induced thermography is the most appealing thermal method since it is highly sensitive, rapid, non-contacting and relatively easy to validate. However, both thermosonics and laser-spot thermography remain useful alternative inspections for more niche applications.

40|$|A 1 MW Lower Hybrid Current drive (LHCD) {{radiofrequency}} {{system is}} used to replace inductive drive on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. It was designed to test Advanced Tokamak (AT) scenarios for future steady-state <b>diverted,</b> high <b>field</b> tokamaks. However, at reactor-relevant densities (n̄e > 1. 10 20 m- 3), an anomalous current drive loss is observed. This loss, known as the LHCD density limit, occurs in diverted plasmas and is correlated with the plasma current and plasma density. Several mechanisms have been implicated {{in the loss of}} current drive, with both experimental and theoretical results suggesting edge power loss. Power modulation is a standard technique used for characterizing power sources and plasma power balance. In this case, the Lower Hybrid radiofrequency (LHRF) power is modulated in time in a set of plasmas across the density range from efficient to negligible current drive. This data {{is used to}} characterize the absorption of LHRF power through the calculation of the LHRF power balance within 15 %, typical of power balance studies. This power balance is used to derive characteristics of the cause behind the LHCD density limit. The immediate nature of LHRF-induced conducted and radiated power losses confirm that LHRF power is absorbed in the edge plasma, even at the lowest densities. The edge losses increase to balance the reduced current drive, indicating that the observed power in the scrape-off-layer (SOL) limits the available power for current drive and the edge losses represent a parasitic mechanism. Unlike edge losses of other radiofrequency systems, this absorption occurs {{with a high degree of}} toroidal symmetry near the plasma separatrix. This indicates absorption occurs just inside the separatrix, or just outside the separatrix over multiple SOL traversals. Measurements of the poloidal distribution of ionization and recombination in the edge were made using a specially designed Ly[alpha] pinhole camera. It utilizes a MgF 2 filter and AXUV diode array to measure Ly[alpha] emission from the lower to upper divertor. Edge deposited LHRF power was found to promptly ionize the active divertor plasma in all diverted topologies. This result highlights the power flow and importance of the divertor plasma in the LHCD density limit. Three independent characteristics indicate the thermal absorption of LHRF power. First, in- /out balance of radiated and conducted LHRF power change with the reversal of the tokamak magnetic fields. Second, comparisons of the conducted heat via Langmuir probes and IR thermography are similar with and without LHRF power. Lastly, the Langmuir probe ratio of Vf l/Te does not significantly modulate with modulated LHRF. A second experiment utilized a high strike-point diverted discharge to determine the edge loss of fast electrons. The high strike point could be observed using the hard X-ray camera, which can compare core and edge X-ray emission. The measured count rates from thick-target bremsstrahlung were interpreted into fast electron fluxes using the Win X-ray code. Theoretical treatments of the fast-electron confinement time were also calculated for Alcator C-Mod. In all cases the fast-electron edge losses are minimal and will be unimportant for future tokamaks due to the small fast electron diffusivity and their large size. The loss of current drive in high density diverted plasmas correlates with high edge plasma collisionality. The newly derived characteristics set stringent requirements in nk for electron Landau damping to cause the edge absorption of LHRF power. Several observed attributes, namely high frequency modulation and low density absorption do not correlate with Landau damping characteristics. However, parasitic collisional absorption in the divertor plasma yields the necessary plasma current, topology, symmetry, thermal, and ionization characteristics. High divertor plasma collisionality is expected if not required for future tokamaks. LHRF systems of future tokamaks must must avoid propagation through collisional regions, even on the first traversal through the SOL. by Ian Charles Faust. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Irrigation systems {{consist of}} three interdependent {{components}} involving: the irrigation scheme, the on-farm {{management and the}} organizations. The irrigation scheme refers to the infrastructure for water acquisition and distribution (water delivery). This study focused on water delivery performance of 10 smallholders irrigation schemes in four regions of Ethiopia, representing diverse water sources, distribution systems, command areas (50 – 6000 ha) and number of beneficiary farmers (233 – 500 farm households) and across agro-ecologies as represented by elevation ranges (1500 – 2725 masl). Relative irrigation supply (RIS), irrigation intensity (Ii), cropping intensity (CI), farm level adequacy (FLA), sustainability of irrigated land (SIL), and equity and field application efficiency were employed as performance indicators. The study involved focus group discussions, household surveys and measurements of water flow across selected points of water delivery systems during 2014 / 2015 cropping season. More than 300 sample farmers were selected randomly from different reaches (head, mid and tail) of the schemes and before the analysis the 10 irrigation schemes were clustered into three typologies (modern, semi-modern and traditional schemes) using seven comprehensive and weighted indicators. The result showed that irrigation typology developed in this study enabled to identify three relatively homogeneous irrigation schemes typologies: modern, semi-modern and traditional. There was apparent diversity of the study schemes in terms of indicators used. At typology level, {{as illustrated by the}} RIS, the highest amount of water was diverted for semi-modern schemes (RIS of 3. 84); while the highest water delivery at farm relative delivery (FRD) was recorded for the modern schemes (FRD 2. 21). Traditional schemes consistently showed lower value for both RIS and FRD. Regardless of their typologies, all study schemes suffer from mismatch of water demand and supply. The lower the RIS and FRD values, the stronger was the water supply disparities between irrigation reaches. Assessment of farmers’ perception on fairness of irrigation water delivery substantiate these arguments. Implicitly, it is important to track the fate of <b>diverted</b> excess water. <b>Field</b> observation and empirical evidences show divergent points of losses of excess water indicating focus areas of improved water conservation on smallholder irrigation schemes. For example the largest proportion of over supplied water (~ 100 %) in the semimodern schemes and in traditional schemes was lost in the conveyance and distribution systems. For modern schemes water losses in the processes of conveyance was low (26 %), while the significant proportion of water (76 %) was lost on farm. In view of this evidence, we concluded that irrigation schemes in Ethiopia, regardless of their typology, have low water delivery performance. As every scheme has shown its own strength and weakness, concluding sustainability in terms of typology is misleading and this suggests that policy directions should be based on composite sustainability indices.
