5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however {{the commander of the}} defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E

25|$|The main plot of The Winter's Tale {{is taken}} from Robert Greene's {{pastoral}} romance Pandosto, published in 1588. Shakespeare's changes to the plot are uncharacteristically slight, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> romance's undramatic nature, and Shakespeare's fidelity to it gives The Winter's Tale its most distinctive feature: the sixteen-year gap between {{the third and fourth}} acts.|$|E

25|$|Planning {{continued}} {{for the northern}} Dutchess stretch, to be built after the war. With the enforced break in construction, and its new authority over the entire road, the commission began to look at ways to improve what had already been built, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road's growing role as a regional artery. The Hawthorne Circle, where the Taconic, Saw Mill River Parkway and NY100 intersected, was the major problem. It had become a magnet for accidents and congestion. A 1944 study recommended it be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange.|$|E
25|$|At special {{sessions}} of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, Smith and the Centre for Public Policy Analysis joined by Members of Congress, including U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, and others, {{called on the}} U.S. Department of Justice to immediately drop the case, and the charges, against General Vang and the other Hmong defendants, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lao government's and Lao Peoples Army's (LPA) ongoing military attacks and egregious human rights violations directed against many of the Laotian and Hmong people, which included attacks on unarmed civilians and political and religious dissidents, atrocities, rape, torture {{and the use of}} mass starvation.|$|E
25|$|The Sunday Times was wary {{of being}} duped, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent Hitler Diaries hoax. As a result, the {{newspaper}} insisted on verifying Vanunu's story with leading nuclear weapon experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer Theodore Taylor and former British AWE engineer Frank Barnaby, who agreed that Vanunu's story was factual and correct. In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, {{was sent to}} Israel {{to find people who}} knew Vanunu and verify his story. Prangnell verified Vanunu's backstory, meeting a few people at Ben-Gurion University who identified Vanunu from a photograph, as well as meeting neighbors and others who confirmed he had worked at the Dimona nuclear plant.|$|E

25|$|Single-mother and lower-class {{families}} {{have a much}} more difficult time negotiating childcare or finding sustainable childcare options. The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do. Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions. In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E
25|$|Coal can {{be found}} in {{abundance}} in the USA and many other countries and its price has remained relatively constant in recent years. Of the traditional fossil fuels - oil, coal, and natural gas - coal is used as a feedstock for 40% of global electricity generation. Fossil fuel consumption and its contribution to large-scale, detrimental environmental changes is becoming a pressing issue, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paris Agreement. In particular, coal contains more CO2 per BTU than oil or natural gas and is responsible for 43% of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. Thus, the lower emissions that IGCC technology allows through gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture is discussed as a way to addressing aforementioned concerns.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{due to the}} {{political}} situation, research on the Kaifeng Jews and Judaism in China came to a standstill {{until the beginning of}} the 1980s, when political and economic reforms were implemented. In the 1980s, the Sino-Judaic Institute was founded by an international group of scholars to further research the history of the Jewish communities in China, promote educational projects related to the history of the Jews in China and assist the extant Jews of Kaifeng. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Israel in 1992 rekindled interest in Judaism and the Jewish experience, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that 25,000 Jewish refugees fled to Shanghai during the Nazi period.|$|E

25|$|Following the London Conference (1939) the British Government {{published}} a White Paper which proposed {{a limit to}} Jewish immigration from Europe, restrictions on Jewish land purchases, and a program for creating an independent state to replace the Mandate within ten years. This was seen by the Yishuv as betrayal of the mandatory terms, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing persecution of Jews in Europe. In response, Zionists organised Aliyah Bet, a program of illegal immigration into Palestine. Lehi, {{a small group of}} extremist Zionists, staged armed attacks on British authorities in Palestine. However, the Jewish Agency, which represented the mainstream Zionist leadership, still hoped to persuade Britain to allow resumed Jewish immigration, and cooperated with Britain in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are pulpwood, sawtimber, or wood veneer stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Hanover {{was only about}} 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, {{to be a major}} courtier to the House of Brunswick was quite an honor, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The British Act of Settlement 1701 designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King William III and his sister-in-law and successor, Queen Anne, were dead. Leibniz {{played a role in the}} initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the British Parliament.|$|E

25|$|This campaign, {{like the}} campaigns of other periods {{that formed the}} basis of the USSR's efforts to {{eliminate}} religion and replace it with atheism supported with a materialist world view, was accompanied with official claims that there was no religious persecution in the USSR, and that believers who were being targeted were for other reasons. Believers were in fact being widely targeted and persecuted for their belief or promotion of religion, as part of the state's campaign to disseminate atheism, but officially the state claimed that no such persecution existed and that the people being targeted - when they admitted that people were being targeted - were only being attacked for resistance to the state or breaking the law. This guise served Soviet propaganda abroad, where it tried to promote a better image of itself <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great criticism against it from foreign religious influences.|$|E
25|$|Meares {{published}} {{an account of}} his Voyages in 1790, which gained widespread attention, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing Nootka Crisis. Meares not only described his voyages to the northwest coast, but put forward a grand vision of a new economic network based in the Pacific, joining in trade widely separated regions such as the Pacific Northwest, China, Japan, Hawaii, and England. This idea tried to imitate Spain's centuries-old Pacific and Atlantic trade networks of the Manila Galleons and Atlantic treasure fleets which linked Asia and the Philippines with North America and Spain since the 16th century. Meares' vision required a loosening of the monopolistic power of the East India Company and the South Sea Company, which between them controlled all British trade in the Pacific. Meares argued strongly for loosening their power. His vision eventually came to pass, in its general form, but not before the long struggle of the Napoleonic Wars was over.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the OLPC {{project was}} heavily criticised over Red Hat's {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA) with Marvell concerning the wireless device in OLPC, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OLPC project being positioned as an open-source friendly initiative. An open letter for documentation was inked by Theo de Raadt (a {{recipient of the}} 2004 Award for the Advancement of Free Software), and the initiative for open documentation has been supported by Richard Stallman, the President of the Free Software Foundation. De Raadt later clarified that he finds an issue with OLPC having proprietary firmware files that {{are not allowed to}} be independently re-distributed (even in the binary form) by third-party operating systems like OpenBSD, as well as receiving no documentation to write the necessary drivers for the operating system. De Raadt has pointed out that the OpenBSD project requires no firmware source code, and no low-level documentation to work on firmware, only requiring the binary distribution rights and documentation to interface with the said binary firmware that runs outside of the main CPU, a quite simple request that is generally honoured by many other wireless device vendors like Ralink. Stallman fully agreed with de Raadt's request to open up the documentation, since Stallman is known to hold an even stronger and more idealistic position in regards to the proprietary components, and requires that even the firmware that runs outside of the main CPU must be provided in its source code form, something de Raadt does not require. De Raadt later has had to point out that such more idealistic and less realistic position has instead been misattributed to OpenBSD's more practical approach to make it look unreasonable, and stood on record that OpenBSD's position is much easier to satisfy, yet it nonetheless remained unresolved.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1452, when Rumelı Hisari was {{completed}} and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452. Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V {{did not have the}} influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing Papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakened state of France and England from the Hundred Years' War, Spain being in the final part of the Reconquista, the internecine fighting in the German Principalities, and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the Battle of Varna of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers One of these was an accomplished soldier from Genoa, Giovanni Giustiniani, who arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453. As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defense of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the Golden Horn offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from Venice, and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.|$|E
