40|$|Health {{systems are}} facing {{significant}} societal and organizational challenges that require enhancing their resilience and sustainability. Public expenditure {{on health care}} and long-term care is expected to increase: health systems are searching for new solutions to controlling spending, implementing the use of available technology and engaging patients in prevention and self-care. The transition toward more sustainable health systems is both delicate and complex, and it needs radical changes of perspective as regards the patients' role and the holistic and multi-disciplinary approach to health care. Over the past years, interest in what is called "Sustainable Healthcare" has grown globally: there is no common definition, but all the approaches to this emerging domain focus on making health care environmentally, economically and socially viable. Although design could successfully address some crucial environmental issues of health care (from waste reduction to resource optimization), design research made almost no contribution to this field. The present work aims at investigating the role of design towards Sustainable Healthcare, to propose, through case study experience, a systemic vision of the topic. Specifically, the research addressed the environmental issues of chronic haemodialysis, a life-saving treatment for people suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease. Medical treatments imply significant challenges because of their technical and operational complexity, that is further complicated by strict regulations and the presence of several users. Design should address environmental sustainability in such a complex system while maintaining the focus on user-centred care. Traditional design approaches cannot tackle the complexity of health care; therefore, a holistic approach is needed. Systemic Design integrates systems thinking and human-centred design methodologies to support designers working on complex design projects in multi-stakeholder and multi-environment systems. The doctoral research is deeply rooted in the framework of Systemic Design, aiming at defining how design strategies can improve the environmental sustainability of medical products, services, and systems, considering its close relationship with the social (people empowerment) and economic (feasibility) aspects. The first part of the research focused on the definition of all the items which make up the system, and the users that directly or indirectly interact with them. Four system items have been identified: products (packaging, disposables, devices), <b>equipment</b> (<b>dialysis</b> machine), treatment (haemodialysis as a whole) and local environment (policy and management strategies). In the second part different approaches, borrowed from sustainable design and human-centred design, have been combined to analyse each item. In order to establish a general frame, three different dialysis units and hospitals based in different European countries (Italy, Sweden, Denmark) were compared. This comprehensive analysis allowed to set specific guidelines for <b>dialysis</b> products, <b>equipment,</b> and treatment. The comparison of three international case studies highlighted how design should work on product and equipment to improve environmental sustainability on a global scale while addressing local systems and their specific needs to improve sustainability on a local level. The outcome of the research is a set of design strategies for the healthcare sector that take into account the technical, operational, social and environmental requirements of chronic treatments. This final result aims at providing a practical tool for designers and health stakeholders to address the design of new solutions for Sustainable Healthcare, considering the needs of direct and indirect users...|$|R

Swedish professor Nils Alwall encased a modified version of this kidney inside a stainless steel canister, to which a negative pressure could be applied, in this way effecting the first truly practical application of hemodialysis, which was done in 1946 at the University of Lund. Alwall also was arguably the inventor of the arteriovenous shunt for dialysis. He reported this first in 1948 where he used such an arteriovenous shunt in rabbits. Subsequently he used such shunts, made of glass, as well as his canister-enclosed dialyzer, to treat 1500 patients in renal failure between 1946 and 1960, as reported to the First International Congress of Nephrology held in Evian in September 1960.

40|$|Introduction Defibrillation of {{patients}} connected to medical equipment {{that is not}} defibrillation proof risks ineffective defibrillation and harm to the operator {{as a result of}} aberrant electrical pathways taken by the defibrillation current. Many renal dialysis systems are not currently defibrillation proof. Although national and international safety standards caution against defibrillating under this circumstance, it appears to be an area of confusion that we have investigated in more detail. Methods Thirty renal dialysis units across the UK were invited to participate in a telephone survey of current practice from 1 October 2004 to 1 October 2005. The Medical Healthcare Regulatory Agency and renal dialysis machine manufacturers were contacted for advice, and current safety standards were reviewed. Results Twenty-eight renal dialysis units completed the survey. Seven (25 %) units would not disconnect patients from <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> during defibrillation, collectively reporting 14 patients who had required defibrillation during dialysis. Eighteen (64. 3 %) units would disconnect patients from <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> during defibrillation, collectively reporting 29 patients who had required defibrillation during dialysis. No complications were identified by this survey, through the MHRA or through a literature search. Conclusion Defibrillation {{of patients}} while undergoing renal dialysis is common practice in the UK. Although no adverse events have been reported, this practice risks injury to the patient and clinical staff, and equipment damage if the <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> is not defibrillation proof. It is in breach of national and international safety standards and should not be practiced...|$|E

Also, most of the outbreaks are limited in size and time, making the planning of a RCT a challenging task. Further, {{due to the lack of}} follow-up with a thorough clinical examination in general and in particular with more advanced diagnostic methods (such as MRI, OCT, and VEP), an underestimation of long-term health sequelae is likely [29, 30].|$|E
30|$|A {{different}} approach involves using hemodialysis to remove CO 2 {{in the form}} of bicarbonate. In respiratory hemodialysis, blood is passed through a dialyzer and bicarbonate is transferred from the blood to the dialysate based on a bicarbonate concentration difference between the two fluids. This is analogous to the movement of waste products in conventional hemodialysis. The similarities between respiratory and conventional hemodialysis provide additional benefits over membrane lung ECCO 2 R, including clinician familiarity, availability of <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> in intensive care units, and a reduced risk of air embolism. Bicarbonate removal, however, has proven challenging due to the development of metabolic acidosis, despite attempts to mitigate the acidosis by replacing the bicarbonate with bases, such as sodium hydroxide, and TRIS [1, 16, 17].|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} A simple anticoagulation protocol {{was developed for}} sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) in patients with AKI, based {{on the use of}} anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution formulation A (ACD-A) and standard <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment.</b> Patients ’ blood recalcification was obtained from calcium back-transport from dialysis fluid. Design, setting, participants, & measurements All patients treated with SLED (8 - to 12 -hour sessions) for AKI in four intensive care units of a university hospital were studied over a 30 -month period, from May 1, 2008 to September 30, 2010. SLED interruptions and their causes, hemorrhagic complications, as well as coagulation parameters, ionized calcium, and blood citrate levels were recorded. Results This study examined 807 SLED sessions in 116 patients (mean age of 69. 7 years [SD 12. 1]; mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 23. 8 [4. 6]). Major bleeding was observed in six patients (5. 2 % or 0. 4 episodes/ 100 person-days follow-up while patients were on SLED treatment). Citrate accumulation never occurred, even in patients with liver dysfunction. Intravenous calcium for ionized hypocalcemia (, 3. 6 mg/dl or, 0. 9 mmol/L) was needed in 28 sessions (3. 4 %); in 8 of these 28 sessions (28. 6 %), low ionized calcium was already present before SLED start. In 92. 6 % of treatments, SLED was completed within the scheduled time (median 8 hours). Interruptions of SLED by impending/irreversible clotting were recorded in 19 sessions (2. 4 %). Blood return was complete in 98 % of the cases. In-hospital mortality was 45 of 116 patients (38. 8 %).

40|$|Renal {{dialysis}} and transplantation {{have been}} used for many years for adults with kidney failure but only recently for children.

However, when consideration is given to the increased probability of PD peritonitis (especially among the indigenous population), it is possible that hospitalisation rates may increase, offsetting some of the reduced burden. The privatisation of home dialysis in 2006 created divided treatment regimes for dialysis patients such that this group is disadvantaged when they require hospitalisation for any reason, due to the privatisation of PD nurses and resources.

30|$|Several {{groups have}} {{investigated}} ways {{to capitalize on}} clinician familiarity with <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> for ECCO 2 R. The PrismaLung uses the PrismaFlex unit as the blood pump for the Medos Hilite oxygenator and demonstrates the efficacy of using dialysis pumps for ECCO 2 R. The PrismaLung system removed 40 – 60  mL/min of CO 2 under hypercapnic conditions, at blood flow rates 200 – 400  mL/min; however, it relies solely on, and is limited by, dissolved carbon dioxide for removal [29]. The respiratory hemodialysis system described in this paper can also use dialysis pumps, but removes 30 – 58 % more CO 2 at comparable blood flow rates. Zanella et al. have published several respiratory hemodialysis circuits with dialysate recirculation [25, 30]. These systems have used either a membrane lung with a lactic acid infusion or an electrodialysis unit as secondary CO 2 removal devices in the dialysate. The reported CO 2 removal rates from the dialysate were 86 and 91  mL/min at a blood flow rate of 250  mL/min, respectively [25, 30].|$|E
