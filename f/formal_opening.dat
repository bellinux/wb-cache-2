5|$|On 31 March 1858 Queen Victoria, {{accompanied}} {{by two of}} her daughters and {{en route to the}} <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> of Battersea Park, crossed the new bridge and declared it officially open, naming it the Victoria Bridge; it was opened to the public three days later, on 3 April 1858. The design met with great critical acclaim, particularly from the Illustrated London News.|$|E
5|$|Tyler did {{not approve}} the opening until his listed {{improvements}} were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865. During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866, and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of imports and exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been laid out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the WPNSA was {{selected}} to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games—mainly because the Academy had recently been built, so no new venue {{would have to be}} provided. However, as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> as the silver and (vastly outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few in his party, did not involve himself further in the gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
40|$|The {{travelling}} exhibition was promoted by CERN and the TERA foundation; it presents {{the contribution of}} nuclear physics to advanced medical research and practice, in particular {{for the treatment of}} different kind of cancers. The exhibition is composed of five sections: a historical introduction; basic information on the biology of cells and radio-damage; the application of physics in modern diagnosis and imaging; particle and heavy-ion cancer therapy; the Italian projects. In every edition historical and present-day instruments, videos and interactive audiovisuals are presented. A catalogue “atomi per la salute” is produced and distributed. A local program of collateral activities (<b>formal</b> <b>openings,</b> press conferences, public seminars, special presentations, public debates) are organized...|$|R
50|$|McKendrick was Chairman of {{the college}} {{committee}} which presided over {{the plans for the}} Cockerell Building, now the College Library, the Auditorium, and the public rooms in Gonville Court, directed by neo-classical architect John Simpson. More recently, he was even more deeply involved in their completion and their <b>formal</b> <b>openings</b> by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales — and in the refurbishment of the Master’s Lodge, also John Simpson’s work.Also under the Mastership of Neil McKendrick the College embarked on a fundraising appeal to support {{the construction of a new}} accommodation building, the Stephen Hawking Building, on the college's West Road site.|$|R
50|$|Scheduled for {{completion}} in September 1999, the center {{opened to the}} public on December 2, 1999 for Christmas by the Bay, the Baldwin County Humane Society's annual holiday fund-raiser. The building's <b>formal</b> grand <b>opening</b> ceremony was held in January 2000.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, the St Germans {{pumping station}} ran at maximum capacity, which was 6134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and {{this led to}} the {{decision}} to replace it with a brand new installation, with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the pumping station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendent of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of draining the Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller pumping stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 2008, the {{pavilion}} {{at the end}} of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire. Eleven fire engines and 80 firefighters could not contain the blaze, which is believed to have started in the north-east tower of the Pavilion. A competition was held to design a new pavilion, and the project was awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol. Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009, and it was scheduled to reopen in July 2010, after a £39 million rebuilding programme. After continuing problems and setbacks, with the pier not opening until a <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony on 23 October 2010, the overall costs have reached £51 million. During the same period there was a £34 million redevelopment of the promenade, including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and pedestrianisation of Pier Square. As part of the work, a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of flood prevention measures.|$|E

5|$|While Pinkerton and Allen were {{building}} the southern extension, Thomas Gaunt had {{been active in}} the area. He was extracting iron ore to be processed in new furnaces at Pembrey, had obtained Kilrhedyn colliery, and had constructed a harbour on the sands at Pembrey. Rennie and Bankes had dismissed the idea of a connection to Gaunt's harbour, as it was not felt to be adequate for the likely volumes of coal traffic, but Gaunt was keen for a canal link. Between late 1823 and April 1824 he built two miles (3.2km) of canal, including a lock at Cross Lane cottage. At its northern end it joined the Kidwelly and Llanelly canal at Ty Gwyn, just {{to the north of the}} disused Ashburnham Canal, and at its southern end, a short tramway linked its terminus to Gaunt's harbour. The Cambrian newspaper carried reports of a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1824, and a <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> on 26 May. By 1843, the canal had become disused, with traffic going to the new harbour at Pembrey instead.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the <b>formal</b> <b>opening</b> of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} epistolarity— {{the interaction}} of the desire for exchange with the materiality of the letter—in the spiritually contemplative letter sequences of James Baxter and Lucie Brock-Broido. Exchange-desire and its indicators include such compositional devices as apostrophe, <b>formal</b> <b>openings</b> and closures, and the letter as prayer; materiality encompasses the paradox of static representation versus physical transfer, the meeting of speech act and property through writing, the potential to upset time through authorial effigy, and the vocabulary of a death language. The lyric poems of the Jerusalem Sonnets and The Master Letters, partly because of their epistolarity, further the endeavor Sharon Cameron describes in Dickinson’s verse; these poems also “attempt to cross boundaries, to blur distinctions between life and death, time and timelessness, figure and its fulfillment, or, to put it more accurately, to wear a passage between them—which is the poem—and, in so doing, to seek refuge in a presence whose permanence will withstand temporal change” (Cameron 135...|$|R

5000|$|Publicity {{about the}} movement, which was {{reported}} by several Manila newspapers, continues to raise eyebrows, more so among many people who associated Guimbaolibot with the killing of American soldiers by native bolo fighters in Balangiga, and not with the priest who suffered because of an erroneous suspicion by the Americans. Despite no <b>formal</b> diocesan <b>opening</b> of Guimbaolibot's cause, he is still recently being revered by many as a [...] "Servant of God".|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, {{despite this}} {{turbulent}} beginning in office, particularly {{in terms of}} a change in role, Samuels was able to continue many of the traditions of office and served with dignity and distinction until his retirement in March 2001. On 21 March 2000 the Queen appointed him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Before his departure from office, the Opposition Leader, Kerry Chikarovski, noted that while there was controversy over Government House at the start of his term: [...] "There {{was a great deal of}} feeling about the issue and among some people that feeling remains. But it was never reflected personally on the Hon. Gordon Samuels. It was reflected against the Government at the time but it was never a reflection on the Governor. Gordon Samuels carried out his duties as the Governor very effectively." [...] Chikarovski was also quoted as saying [...] "As time went on it became perfectly clear that the Governor was going to devote all of his time, and his wife all of her time, to the job, which they intended to perform in pretty much the usual way, including the pomp and ceremony of <b>formal</b> <b>openings</b> of Parliament." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1540s {{he was the}} most {{prolific}} composer of the group around Willaert, publishing a total of four separate collections of secular music.
