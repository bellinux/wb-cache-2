We observe that the <b>influence</b> of community including multiple users outweighs the individual <b>influence.</b> Existing models focus on the individual <b>influence</b> analysis, but few studies estimate the community <b>influence</b> that is ubiquitous in online social network. A major challenge lies in that researchers need {{to take into account}} many factors, such as user <b>influence,</b> social trust, and user relationship, to model community-level <b>influence.</b> In this paper, aiming to assess the community-level <b>influence</b> effectively and accurately, we formulate the problem of modeling community <b>influence</b> and construct a community-level <b>influence</b> analysis model. It first eliminates the zombie fans and then calculates the user <b>influence.</b> Next, it calculates the user final <b>influence</b> by combining the user <b>influence</b> and the willingness of diffusing theme information. Finally, it evaluates the community <b>influence</b> by comprehensively studying the user final <b>influence,</b> social trust, and relationship tightness between intrausers of communities. To handle real-world applications, we propose a community-level <b>influence</b> analysis algorithm called CIAA.

40|$|In the paper, we {{introduce}} {{and study}} generalized weighted <b>influence</b> indices {{of a coalition}} on a player, where players have an ordered set of possible actions. Each player has an inclination to choose one of the actions. Due to <b>influence</b> of a coalition of other players, a final decision of the player may be different from his original inclination. An <b>influence</b> in such situations {{is measured by the}} general weighted <b>influence</b> index. In a particular case, the decision of the player may be closer to the inclination of the <b>influencing</b> coalition than his inclination was. The weighted <b>influence</b> index which captures such a case is called the positive weighted <b>influence</b> index. We also consider the negative weighted <b>influence</b> index, where a final decision of the player goes farther away from the inclination of the <b>influencing</b> coalition. Some special cases of the weighted <b>influence</b> indices, called a possibility <b>influence</b> index and an equidistributed <b>influence</b> index, are also defined. We consider different <b>influence</b> functions and study their properties. A set of followers and a set of a conditional followers of a given coalition are defined, and their properties are analyzed.

After that, we rank users by their “maximal <b>influence</b> degree.” When two users have the same “maximal <b>influence</b> degree”: Inf("U_ 1 ") = V.Strong and Inf("U_ 2 ") = V.Strong we compare belief masses of the next-greater <b>influence</b> degree and rank them according to the next-greater <b>influence</b> degree.|$|R
50|$|Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard {{described}} two psychological {{needs that}} lead humans {{to conform to}} the expectations of others.

Informational <b>influence</b> comes into play when people are uncertain, either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement. Normative <b>influence</b> is an <b>influence</b> {{to conform to the}} positive expectations of others.

Here we use triadic analysis (parent and two siblings) to explore the <b>influence</b> of family on consumer innovativeness. We develop hypotheses that postulate parental <b>influence,</b> and, based on conflicting views of sibling similarity in the recent behavioral genetics and developmental psychology literature, set competing hypotheses about sibling <b>influence</b> on innovativeness and innovative behavior.

40|$|In the paper, we {{investigate}} the Hoede-Bakker index - the notion which computes the overall decisional ‘power' {{of a player}} in a social network. It is assumed that each player has an inclination (original decision) to say ‘yes' or ‘no' which, due to <b>influence</b> of other players, may {{be different from the}} final decision of the player. The main drawback of the Hoede-Bakker index is that it hides the actual role of the <b>influence</b> function, analyzing only the final decision in terms of success and failure. In this paper, we further investigate the Hoede-Bakker index, proposing an improvement which fully takes into account the mutual <b>influence</b> among players. A global index which distinguishes an <b>influence</b> degree from a ‘power' index is analyzed. We define weighted <b>influence</b> indices, in particular, a possibility <b>influence</b> index which takes into account any possibility of <b>influence,</b> and a certainty <b>influence</b> index which expresses certainty of <b>influence.</b> We consider different <b>influence</b> functions and study their properties.
