The companies posted a huer (a lookout) on Mullion Island to watch for the dark patch of a nearby shoal of pilchards. There are still a few boats operating a small shellfish industry.|$|R
50|$|The Kamov Ka-15 (NATO {{reporting}} name Hen) was a Soviet two-seat {{utility helicopter}} with coaxial rotors which first flew on April 14, 1952 {{at the hands}} of test pilot D.K.Yefremov. State acceptance trials were completed in 1955, and the helicopter entered production the following year at aircraft factory No.99 in Ulan-Ude.

40|$|To {{complement}} existing <b>fishery</b> <b>control</b> measures, {{in particular}} the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), a pilot operational system to find fishing vessels in satellite images was set up. Radar is the mainstay of the system, which furthermore includes fully automated image processing and communication protocols with the authorities. Different image types are used to match different fisheries – oceanic, shelf and coastal. Vessel detection rates can be 75 - 100 % depending on image type and vessel size. Output of the system, {{in the form of}} an overview of vessel positions in the area highlighting any discrepancies with otherwise reported positions, can be at the authorities within 30 min of the satellite image being taken – fast enough to task airborne inspection for follow up.

40|$|Really Responsive Regulation {{seeks to}} add to current {{theories}} of enforcement by stressing the case for regulators to be responsive {{not only to the}} attitude of the regulated firm but also to the operating and cognitive frameworks of firms; the institutional environment and performance of the regulatory regime; the different logics of regulatory tools and strategies; and to changes in each of these elements. The approach pervades all the different tasks of enforcement activity: detecting undesirable or non-compliant behaviour; developing tools and strategies for responding to that behaviour; enforcing those tools and strategies; assessing their success or failure; and modifying them accordingly. The value of the approach is shown by outlining its potential application to UK environmental and <b>fisheries</b> <b>controls.</b> Putting the system into effect is itself challenging but failing to regulate really responsively can constitute an expensive process of shooting in the dark...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the history}} of ecology, {{fluctuations}} of populations have been a dominating topic, and endogenous causes of fluctuations and oscillations have been recognized and studied for more than 80 years. Here we analyzed an historical dataset, covering more than 130 years, of European lobster (Homarus gammarus) catches. The data shows periodic fluctuations, which are first dampened and then disappear over time. The disappearance of the periodicity coincided with {{a substantial increase in}} fishing effort and the oscillations have not reappeared in the time series. The shifting baseline syndrome has changed our perception of not only the status of the stock, but also the regulating pressures. We describe the transition of a naturally regulated lobster population into a heavily exploited <b>fisheries</b> <b>controlled</b> stock. This is shown by the incorporation of environmental and endogenous processes in generalized additive models, autocorrelation functions and periodicity analyses of time-series...|$|R
