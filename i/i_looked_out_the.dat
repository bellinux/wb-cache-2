500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|According to Reuters, some {{neighbors and}} {{relatives}} of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m., enter homes and open fire. [...] "They were all drunk and shooting all over the place," [...] said neighbor Agha Lala. [...] According to The New York Times, one of the attack's survivors and [...] "at least five other villagers" [...] described seeing a number of soldiers, while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman. [...] One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, reported involvement {{of a large number}} of people: [...] "When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into the house... I saw more than 20 people when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling me not to leave the house or they'd kill me." [...] An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak, whose father was killed, reported that [...] "one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights." [...] The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen [...] "numerous soldiers" [...] with headlamps and lighted guns. [...] Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned, claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help. In response, Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims.|$|E
60|$|After I {{went up to}} my room <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. It {{was only}} about ten o'clock, but I looked upon a silent town. The drizzle continued, {{spangled}} with dim lights, as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the Ladies' Exchange.|$|E

60|$|There {{was silence}} again. A nameless fear crept over me, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{ten o'clock}} the silver dollars {{dropping}} {{on the bar}} slowed down to playing two-steps and marches instead of jigs. But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at Bird City Savings and Loan Co., and I knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{sat down}} and went on playing. The Trimble gang had a roughhouse for sure. They were getting good and drunk. They'd drink a while and holler a while, and then they'd shoot up a few bottles and glasses. Two or three times they came and tried to open our door. Then there was some more {{shooting}} outside, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window again. Ham Gossett, the town marshal, had a posse in the houses and stores across the street, {{and was trying to}} bag a Trimble or two through the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing." [...] His voice sank, and {{his eyes}} dropped to Frona, leaning against the box beneath him and {{steadying}} it. She {{did not seem to}} be affected. [...] "Bella came over to me, but I closed my eyes and breathed regularly. She held the slush-lamp to me, but I played sleep naturally enough to fool her. Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm, and a cry, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> Indian was hacking at Borg with a knife, and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him. When they did grapple, Bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a strangle-hold about her husband's neck. She put her knee into the small of his back, and bent him backward and, with the Indian helping, threw him to the floor." ...|$|E
60|$|June 20th.--Eight o'clock. The sun {{is shining}} in a clear sky. I have not been near my bed--I have not once closed my weary wakeful eyes.

5000|$|Using the {{royalties}} {{she received}} {{from her first}} two albums, she {{bought a house in}} rural England close to her parents' home in Yeovil. She described her new home as [...] "completely in the countryside. I have no neighbors. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, all <b>I</b> see are fields." [...] Living in near isolation, she began writing the songs that would appear on To Bring You My Love.|$|R
6000|$|I {{passed by}} the home of somebody's (or everybody's) Uncle Bill, one day over on the Plymouth shore. It was a {{schooner}} half keeled-up on the mud: we aroused the master out of a sound sleep at noonday, by thumping {{on the bottom of}} his vessel till he presented himself at the hatchway, for we wanted to borrow his clam-digger. Meaning to make him a call, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next morning, and lo! he had run over to [...] "the Pines" [...] the evening before, fearing an easterly storm. He outrode the great gale in the spring of 1851, dashing about alone in Plymouth Bay. He goes after rockweed, lighters vessels, and saves wrecks. I still saw him lying in the mud over at [...] "the Pines" [...] in the horizon, which place he could not leave if he would till flood tide. But he would not then probably. This waiting for the tide is a singular feature in life by the sea-shore. A frequent answer is, [...] "Well! you can't start for two hours yet." [...] It is something new to a landsman, and at first he is not disposed to wait. History says that [...] "two inhabitants of Truro were the first who adventured to the Falkland Isles in pursuit of whales. This voyage was undertaken in the year 1774, by the advice of Admiral Montague of the British navy, and was crowned with success." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{change from}} storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark and {{sluggish}} hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last. Suddenly {{an influx of}} light filled my house, though the evening was at hand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, and lo! where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, {{as if it had}} intelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance, the first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note I shall not forget for many a thousand more--the same sweet and powerful song as of yore. O the evening robin, {{at the end of a}} New England summer day! If I could ever find the twig he sits upon! I mean he; I mean the twig. This at least is not the Turdus migratorius. The pitch pines and shrub oaks about my house, which had so long drooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter, greener, and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain any more. You may tell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very wood-pile, whether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled by the honking of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers getting in late from Southern lakes, and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I could hear the rush of their wings; when, driving toward my house, they suddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first spring night in the woods.|$|E
5000|$|Bertil Grandinson, {{who lives}} {{on the top floor}} of the house, explained: [...] "We woke up at half past two by a terrible bang. It was as if an {{aeroplane}} crashed. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and noted then to my great surprise that the train had run into the house. It is terrible and very shocking".|$|E

5000|$|Owen told Billboard {{that the}} song was written {{while they were in}} Pennsylvania. [...] "We'd been playing guitars on the bus, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window...and said it's a sad-lookin' moon tonight,' and Teddy said, 'Wow. Let's write that song.' So Teddy, Greg, and I just went to working on it, and things just kind of fell together, as good songs and good {{feelings}} often do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hoga was moored {{with other}} yard service craft near the drydocks at 1010 Dock when Pearl Harbor was {{attacked}} by Japanese forces {{on the morning of}} 7 December 1941. Ten of Hogas eleven-man crew were aboard; the cook was ashore. As the planes swooped in over the harbor, Assistant Tugmaster Robert Brown, sleeping in the pilothouse, was awakened by the dropping bombs. [...] "I raised up and looked out and all hell was breaking loose. I saw planes all over the place. Japanese planes and several ships on fire." [...] Chief Boatswain's Mate Joseph B. McManus, the Tugmaster, was shaving in his cabin. [...] "I heard the noise and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole...and the first sight I saw was the Oklahoma which had quite a list. She had been hit ... The Chief Engineer was standing on the dock and I heard him say, 'My God! This is war! ...|$|E
5000|$|Stanley met {{the members}} of the Grateful Dead during 1965. He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman. Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley {{designed}} the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo. The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: [...] "One day in the rain, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes I {{glanced at}} <b>the</b> newspaper; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> pleasant Southern garden, where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows, and laurels, orange-trees, and myrtles.|$|R

5000|$|Cox was {{detained}} in 1977: [...] When they came, I was preparing an {{issue on the}} birthday of the queen of Holland. I made them wait until I was finished, then I called Maud to let her know. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw a (Ford) Falcon and a Peugeot with a sunroof, with the driver who looked like a Mexican bandido, with crossed bandoliers. They took me to Coordinación Federal through the basement, {{and as soon as}} I arrived, I saw a big swastika on the wall. They put me in a cell, without clothes, a kind of tube. It was a very strong experience. I did not know it at the time, but when they detained me, there was strong international pressure. I had my contacts. Tex Harris, who was a super guy, a diplomat from the USA who had been sent by Jimmy Carter and Patricia Derian, did {{a lot of work to}} free me.|$|E
5000|$|The Solomons {{first meet}} the Big Giant Head in person {{when he arrived}} by plane at their local airport, in an {{obviously}} agitated state. When asked about his flight, he responded [...] "Horrifying, at first. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and ... I saw something on the wing of the plane", to which Dick responded [...] "The same thing happened to me!" [...] This is a double reference. In an early episode, Dick attempts to fly {{for the first time}} and is frightened when he sees something on the wing of the plane. Both references are also to the Twilight Zone story [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", which tells of a man on a commercial flight who is convinced he sees a creature on the plane's wing which no one else can see. Both William Shatner and John Lithgow (Dick) had previously played that Twilight Zone character; Shatner played it in the original 1963 TV series episode, and Lithgow played it in the 1983 movie remake.|$|E

Many of the time spectra, which are represented by superimpositions of different rhythmic layers—of different speeds in each layer—their envelope which describes the increase and decrease of the number of layers, their shape, so to speak, the shape of the time field, are the curves of the mountain's contour which I saw when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|E

5000|$|Recording {{the album}} in 1987, the {{recording}} sessions for the album, which spanned nine months, began at Swanyard Studios, London for a week, followed by [...] "a place in Hoxton", before the band recorded {{for two weeks}} at the famous Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany, only {{two years before the}} fall of the Berlin Wall. Chris Salmon said [...] "It was an amazing place, I’m so glad we did it just before the wall came down. It had a faded grandeur; I think it was a brothel at some time." [...] Stephen Street was the engineer for the band at Hansa, but he soon had to leave the sessions to work on Morrissey's debut album Viva Hate. The first person the band met at Hansa Studios was Nick Cave, who was recording Tender Prey. Salmon recalled [...] "Hansa was great, I think the first person we met was Nick Cave, we had been up for 48 hours and we arrived and opened the doors and there's a very well-spoken nattily dressed gentleman. [...] "Was that Nick Cave?" [...] "Yeah it was, wasn’t it?" [...] I think he had just finished Kicking Against the Pricks." [...] McKahey recalled [...] "Berlin in 1987, really exciting, the wall was up. It was a very Bohemian city, an incredible scene, the clubs were open all night, it had a real sense of danger.
