40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the ways of {{improving}} gear grinding operations. The technologic factors affecting the radial runout of tooth surfaces at grinding basic holes of gears are investigated. The analytical relations for estimation of a degree of influence of these factors are received. The dominant factors determining non-uniformity of the tooth surface <b>grinding</b> <b>allowance</b> are found out and the ways for its decreasing are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The SKH mold steels were pre-processed, {{ground by}} the precise {{sharpening}} stone to have Ra= 10 - 15 Âµm for subsequent precise <b>grinding</b> <b>allowance,</b> and then precisely ground by the CBN grinding wheel. The {{influence of the}} main axel rotation speed and the sample hardness on the grinding situation was discussed in this study. The result shows that the surface roughness of the low hardness SKH 51 mold steel could be improved markedly as rotation speed increased. On the contrary, there is no obvious improvement for the high hardness SKH 59 mold steel. With increasing rotation speed, the surface roughness of workpieces improved significantly due to the increasing of grinding force. However, at high rotation speed, it was unable further improved since the grinding force nearly remaining the same level, causing the less improvement on the surface roughness of workpieces. Key words: precision grinding, surface roughness, grinding speed 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{develop the}} {{algorithm}} of {{determination of the}} cutting mode at grinding of working surface of mandrel cold-rolling of pipes {{on the stage of}} removal of draft allowance. Methodology. The algorithm of determination of three constituents of the cutting mode at <b>grinding</b> of draft <b>allowance</b> is presented. It is suggested to count a longitudinal feed on a turn from the necessary roughness of the processed surface, and combination of transversal feed on a passage-way and rotation feed of workpiece ? on the mathematical model of process and entered coefficient of possible resilient deformation of the technological processing system. A mathematical model takes into account loop of cutting process in the resilient system and nonlinear dependences of cutting force from material removal rate. The application programs of decision of task of determination of such combination are created three constituents of the grinding mode which provide a maximum of the productivity. A method and algorithms developed are utilized in the computer aided manufacturing system for operation of grinding of working surface of mandrel cold-rolling mills pipes. ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ???? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????. ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????????, ? ????????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ? ??????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ? ?? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????. ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????? ?? ???????? ???????? ????????. ??????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ???? ???????????? ?????? ??????????, ??????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????????????. ??????????? ???????? ? ????????? ???????????? ? ??? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ???...|$|R
