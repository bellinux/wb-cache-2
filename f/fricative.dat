5|$|Angle brackets, , {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} sequence of runes that cannot be interpreted with certainty. Other special signs are þ and ð, where the first one is the thorn letter which represents a voiceless dental <b>fricative</b> as th in English thing. The second letter is eth which stands for a voiced dental <b>fricative</b> as th in English them. The ʀ sign represents the yr rune, and ô {{is the same as the}} Icelandic O caudata ǫ.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrew name of {{the city}} is Aza (עזה) – the ayin at the {{beginning}} of the word represented a voiced velar <b>fricative</b> in Biblical Hebrew, but in Modern Hebrew, it is silent.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → <b>fricative</b> → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both <b>fricative</b> and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E
2500|$|Nonstandard <b>fricatives</b> are the {{mechanical}} sounds such as snare drums, cymbals, and other buzzing noises in beatboxing {{that are made}} with <b>fricatives.</b> Certain sounds, such as velar lateral <b>fricatives,</b> bilabial lateral <b>fricatives,</b> and linguolabial <b>fricatives,</b> are all judged impossible according to the IPA but are technically possible and are sounds that are commonly used in beatboxing.|$|R
50|$|The retroflex and {{alveolar}} <b>fricatives</b> {{are found}} in different distributions: retroflex <b>fricatives</b> in Standard are often fronted to alveolar <b>fricatives</b> in Luoyang.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} features of Tanacross {{is the presence}} of so-called semi-voiced <b>fricatives,</b> a unique type of segment which appear to begin voiceless and transition to fully voiced. Acoustically, semi-voiced <b>fricatives</b> are characterized by lower intensity of high-frequency frication. Semi-voiced <b>fricatives</b> occur in stem-initial position in lieu of fully voiced <b>fricatives.</b> Even though they are essentially allophonic variants of the voiced <b>fricatives,</b> semi-voiced <b>fricatives</b> are indicated in the practical orthography via an underscore beneath the corresponding voiceless segment.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar <b>fricative,</b> a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E

25|$|<b>Fricatives</b> {{in upper}} and lower {{registers}} are assumed to derive from voiceless and voiced <b>fricatives</b> respectively, broadly corresponding to the voiceless and voiced <b>fricatives</b> of Middle Chinese.|$|R
25|$|In addition, many {{researchers}} use the x-caron (x̌) for the voiceless uvular <b>fricative.</b> The {{use of the}} standard IPA belted l (ɬ) for the voiceless lateral <b>fricative</b> is becoming increasingly common.|$|E

25|$|The tables below show common sound changes {{involved}} in lenition. In some cases, lenition may skip {{one of the}} sound changes. The change voiceless stop > <b>fricative</b> is more common than the series of changes voiceless stop > affricate > <b>fricative.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Original non-sibilant <b>fricatives</b> {{are absent}} from most other {{languages}} of Eurasia. Voiceless <b>fricatives</b> prevail over voiced ones {{in most of}} northern America. Both voiced and voiceless <b>fricatives</b> occur in Nivkh.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fricatives</b> {{are very}} {{commonly}} voiced, though cross-linguistically voiced <b>fricatives</b> {{are not nearly}} as common as tenuis ("plain") <b>fricatives.</b> Other phonations are common in languages that have those phonations in their stop consonants.

25|$|Grimm's law {{as applied}} to pre-proto-Germanic is a chain shift of the {{original}} Indo-European plosives.

40|$|Nasalized oral <b>fricatives</b> do {{not exist}} in phonemic {{opposition}} to oral <b>fricatives</b> in any language of the world. It has been claimed that nasalized <b>fricatives</b> cannot exist phonetically; however, numerous gram-matical descriptions suggest otherwise. This claim is addressed by measuring the presence of nasal air-flow during the production of various anterior frica-tives in conditions of coarticulatory nasalization. If nasal exhalation is taken as the definition of nasal-ization, then nasalized <b>fricatives</b> are shown to oc-cur in speech.

40|$|Results of an {{acoustic}} study of voiceless <b>fricatives</b> in seven languages are presented. Three measurements were taken: duration, center of gravity, and overall spectral shape. In addition, formant transitions from adjacent vowels were measured for {{a subset of}} the <b>fricatives</b> in certain languages. <b>Fricatives</b> were well differentiated in terms of overall spectral shape and their coarticulation effects on formant transitions for adjacent vowels. The center of gravity measurement also proved useful in differentiating certain <b>fricatives.</b> Duration generally was less useful in differentiating the <b>fricatives.</b> In general, results were consistent across speakers and languages, with lateral <b>fricatives</b> displaying the greatest interspeaker variation in their acoustic properties and /s / providing the greatest source of interspeaker variation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} of aerodynamic laws to the unique geometry of the hu-man vocal tract allows us to make phonological and typological predictions about speech sounds typified by particular aerodynamic regimes. For example, {{some have argued that}} the realization of nasalized <b>fricatives</b> is improbable because <b>fricatives</b> and nasals have an-tagonistic aerodynamic specifications. <b>Fricatives</b> require high pressure behind the suprala-ryngeal constriction as a precondition for high particle velocity. Nasalization, on the other hand, vents back pressure by allowing air to escape through the velopharyngeal orifice. This implies that an open velopharyngeal port will reduce oral particle velocity, thereby potentially extinguishing frication. By using a mechanical model of the vocal tract and spoken <b>fricatives</b> that have undergone coarticulatory nasalization, it is shown that nasal-ization must alter the spectral characteristics of <b>fricatives,</b> e. g. by reducing high-frequency energy and increasing the bandwidth of spectral prominences. These spectral modifica-tions are liable to change the percept of <b>fricatives</b> at different places of articulation. It is hypothesized that nasalization generally has a deleterious effect on the acoustic dis-tinctiveness of <b>fricatives,</b> explaining the typological rarity of nasalized <b>fricatives.</b> It als...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the changes}} {{described}} by Grimm's law had taken place, {{there was only}} one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced <b>fricatives.</b> They eventually became stops {{at the beginning of a}} word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonant, but <b>fricatives</b> elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or <b>fricatives</b> at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced <b>fricatives,</b> before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they may also have become stops at first, softening to <b>fricatives</b> in most positions later.|$|R
