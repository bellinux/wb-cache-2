5|$|Our {{main source}} of {{information}} about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

25|$|The {{prehistory}} of the European peoples can {{be traced}} by the examination of archaeological sites, linguistic studies and by {{the examination of the}} DNA {{of the people who live}} in Europe or from ancient DNA.

Although it is possible to track migrations of people across Europe using founder analysis of DNA, most <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> movements comes from archaeology.|$|E
25|$|Kings Gap is {{suitable}} habitat {{for a variety}} of reptiles, including the box turtle, the five-lined skink (one of Pennsylvania's few lizards), the northern copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Sightings of these reptiles are not uncommon in the summer months. In the Mansion Day Use Area, copperheads and rattlesnakes are sometimes seen hunting rodents along the stone walls of the mansion patio and garden. Although these snakes are venomous and should be respected, in their natural habitats they retreat when threatened. The timber rattlesnake is classified as a candidate species in Pennsylvania, which means it could receive endangered or threatened status in the future.

25|$|Offshore wind {{resource}} characteristics span a {{range of}} spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions. For the North Sea, wind turbine energy is around 30kWh/m2 of sea area, per year, delivered to grid. The energy per sea area is roughly independent of turbine size. Necessary data includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations. Other factors include marine growth, salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed. A number of things are {{necessary in order to}} attain the necessary <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> subjects. Existing hardware for these measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future.|$|E

However, Tsukamoto notes that in light of new <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> species, [...] "it seems more likely to conclude that the species [...] is a new species which has been misidentitied as C. shebbearei for a long time, rather than to think that both C. shebbearei and C. rajah n. sp. are living in pitchers of Nepenthes rajah on Mt. Kinabalu".|$|E
500|$|The Home Fleet's {{plans were}} {{informed}} by considerable intelligence on German shipping movements and forces in northern Norway. The Royal Navy's Operational Intelligence Centre collated <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> topics, and regularly provided assessments to the Home Fleet and other commands. The decision {{to attack the}} Bodø area was {{made on the basis}} of Ultra intelligence obtained by decoding German radio signals, from which the Allies learned that the ships in the region included the large oil tanker , which was carrying fuel for the German battle group at Altafjord. In addition, at the time of Operation Leader two groups of Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agents operated radio transmitters on the coast of Helgeland: [...] "Crux III" [...] on the island of Renga and [...] "Pisces" [...] on Lurøy. Both groups provided reports to the Allies on the weather and shipping movements in the target area in the lead-up to the attack. From 3 October onwards, [...] "Crux III" [...] radioed weather reports every half hour.|$|E
