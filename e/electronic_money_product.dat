It is argued that <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> might eventually make paper money obsolete.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the different}} approaches adopted for the regulation of payment systems {{in a variety of}} legislative instruments by the European Union (EU). It looks in particular at how the institutions that issue new <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> <b>products</b> are regulated and supervised by the relevant authorities in the EU, in comparison with existing institutions such as banks. It analyses some of the lessons that may be learned by the South African Development Corporation (SADC) from the regulatory approaches for <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> institutions adopted by the EU. The article asks if the approach adopted by the EU may be useful for the future regulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> institutions in the SADC. The proliferation of electronic devices that arrived with the invention of the Internet has sparked some regulatory challenges. This development has become global and involves both developed and developing countries, including regions such as the SADC. It is asked if these technological developments should be addressed by means of a concrete regulatory framework while they continue to develop, instead of the regulators waiting to observe and acquaint themselves with the relevant regulatory challenges that underpin the innovations. The EU has attempted to address the anticipated regulatory challenges that came about with the development of <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> and to align its regulatory approach with other payment systems. This article discusses the regulatory approaches adopted in the EU and provides an overview that the SADC may use in order to adopt an effective regulatory framework for <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> and the institutions that issue these methods of payment. It analyses both the achievements and the challenges that the EU faced (and continues to face) in developing the regulation of e-money, and recommends some possible approaches derived from the lessons learned. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that the network {{externalities}} theory provides a useful framework to analyse the introduction and further development of the new electronic payment instruments currently being launched. To that end the paper presents a pragmatic (and selective) reading of the network externalities literature; i. e., it screens the literature in search of both theoretical insights and empirical results which can be transposed to the case of electronic payment instruments. In so doing, the paper concentrates on the so-called <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> <b>products</b> and, especially, on electronic purses. Specifically the paper shows that the network externalities literature provides a number of useful insights concerning consumer reactions to the introduction of electronic purses (and the ways in which card issuers can anticipate these reactions) and concerning the strategies card issuers may follow in a competitive market with incompatible electronic purses. All this is substantiated by multiple references to real-life situations. The first section of the paper defines the concept of network externalities. The third section demonstrates that payment cards in general are indeed network goods. It also points out which kind(s) of network effects apply to the electronic purses currently available. The paper then goes on to answer five questions in depth. Firstly, what can we learn from the network externalities literature as far as the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem is concerned? — the problem being: merchants will not invest in terminals without a sufficient number of potential users, while the general public will not use electronic purses unless there is sufficient acceptance. Secondly, is there room for more than one incompatible electronic purse, or is the electronic purse market prone to ‘tipping’ and ‘lock-in’? Thirdly, can an electronic purse issuer gain a (decisive) first-mover advantage by entering the market before others do? Fourthly, under which conditions will card issuers be inclined to make their electronic purses compatible? And finally, what is the optimum pricing strategy for an electronic purse issuer?
