5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be opened, exposing the altar.

5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was taking time to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} Central America and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue.

Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade {{was due to the}} system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} {{ratified by}} seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not ratified by another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
