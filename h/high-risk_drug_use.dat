Problem behavior theory posits that youth with certain personality characteristics {{are more likely to}} engage in additional risk behaviors.

We investigated the interaction between these concepts to explain two HIV-related risk behaviors: (1) non-condom use and (2) <b>high-risk</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> among homeless youth (n= 460) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. An index of recurring problem behaviors represented that theory and two measures of homelessness represented situational adversity.

40|$|Introduction: Annually {{eight million}} {{emergency}} department (ED) visits {{are attributable to}} alcohol use. Screening ED patients for at-risk alcohol and substance use is an integral component of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment programs, shown to be effective at reducing substance use. The objective is to evaluate ED patients’ acceptance of and willingness to disclose alcohol/substance use via a computer kiosk versus an in-person interview. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, survey-based study. Eligible participants included those who presented to walk-in triage, were English-speaking, ≥ 18 years, were clinically stable and able to consent. Patients {{had the opportunity to}} access the kiosk in the ED waiting room, and were approached for an in-person survey by a research assistant (9 am- 5 pm weekdays). Both surveys used validated assessment tools to assess drug and alcohol use. Disclosure statistics and preferences were calculated using chi-square tests and McNemar’s test. Results: A total of 1, 207 patients were screened: 229 in person only, 824 by kiosk, and 154 by both in person and kiosk. Single-modality participants were more likely to disclose hazardous drinking (p= 0. 003) and <b>high-risk</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (OR= 22. 3 [12. 3 - 42. 2]; p< 0. 0001) via kiosk.

40|$|Incarcerated women {{frequently}} report {{initiation of}} substance use and sexual encounters at an early age, and often engage in <b>high-risk</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and sexual behaviors as adults. Less is known, however, {{about the relationship between}} age of onset of these risk behaviors, as well as the timing of first arrest, and risky behaviors in adulthood. Objectives of the present study were to: 1) profile age of first arrest, age of first illicit drug use, and age of first sex in a sample of rural women drug users (N= 400) recruited from jails and screened for high-risk behaviors; 2) to examine the relationships among the age of onset of these risk behaviors; and 3) to examine the unique contributions of these onset variables to adult <b>high-risk</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and high-risk sexual practices. Ages of initiation were all positively and significantly correlated at the bivariate level, indicating that onset of sex, illicit drug use, and arrest are related among high-risk rural women. In logistic regression models, each onset variable independently increased the likelihood of several specific adult risky substance-using or sexual behaviors; independent effects of demographic covariates were also noted. In describing rural women’s initiation of risky behaviors and involvement with the justice system and exploring associated differences in adult trajectories, this study has contributed {{to an understanding of the}} development of high-risk rural women.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS) is a {{relatively}} new questionnaire that assesses individual personality risk for substance-related problems. Preliminary findings have indicated that the SURPS is a useful measure for identifying characteristics predisposing some individuals to alcohol and other <b>drug</b> (AOD) <b>use.</b> High levels of hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, sensation seeking, and impulsivity are each associated with specific patterns of substance use caused by underlying motivational susceptibilities. Furthermore, incorporating these traits into tailored prevention and treatment efforts have shown value in other countries. The present study enrolled a community sample in Cape Town, South Africa and asked respondents about their demographics, history of AOD use, personality as measured by the SURPS, and other mental health indicators. This information was used to identify personality risks in the local population and validate the utility of the SURPS {{for the first time in}} Sub-Saharan Africa. Results found that sensation seekers had a significantly higher risk for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogen use compared to other personality groups and controls. As expected, respondents demonstrating anxiety sensitivity also showed high-risk use of alcohol, but less <b>high-risk</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Finally, the hopelessness group exhibited a higher risk for opioid use but overall, hopelessness and impulsivity had little impact on concurrent substance use, which contrasts with other literature. Unlike findings from mostly European and North American samples that indicate generalizability, this study did not find structural or concurrent validity for the SURPS.

Objective: To explore the experiences of hospitalized adults with SUD and to better understand patient and system level factors impacting readiness for change. Design: We performed a qualitative study using individual interviews. The study was nested within a larger mixed-methods needs assessment. Participants and Setting: Hospitalized adults admitted to medical or surgical units at an urban academic medical center who reported <b>high-risk</b> alcohol or <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on AUDIT-C or single-item <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> screener. Approach: We conducted a thematic analysis, using an inductive approach at a semantic level. Key Results: Thirty-two patients participated. The mean age was 43 years; 75 % were men, and 68 % identified as white. Participants reported moderate to high-risk alcohol (39 %), amphetamine (46 %), and opioid (65 %) use. Emergent themes highlight the influence of hospitalization at the patient, provider, and health system levels. Many patients experienced hospitalization as a wake-up call, where mortality was motivation for change and hospitalization disrupted substance use. However, many participants voiced complex narratives of social chaos, trauma, homelessness, and chronic pain. Participants valued providers who understood SUD and the importance of treatment choice. Patient experience suggests the importance of peers in the hospital setting, access to medication-assisted treatment, and coordinated care post-discharge.

Regression analysis controlling for age, gender, education, housing and employment revealed lesbian, gay or bisexual individuals {{were significantly more likely to}} have used ecstasy, ketamine and alcohol in the past 30 days compared to heterosexual participants. Inadequate housing increased the likelihood of crack use among both lesbian, gay and bisexuals and heterosexuals, but with considerably higher odds for the lesbian, gay and bisexual group. Lesbian, gay and bisexual participants reported less alcohol harm but greater ecstasy and ketamine harm, the latter two categorised by the ASSIST as amphetamine and hallucinogen harms. Results suggest encouraging harm reduction among sexual minority, <b>high-risk</b> <b>drug</b> users, emphasising ecstasy and ketamine. The impact of stable housing on <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> should also be considered...|$|R
30|$|Tracking the {{possession}} of <b>high-risk</b> <b>drugs</b> and new psychoactive substances in a society is important for policy makers in order to investigate the circumstances and impact of these substances. There is a trend in emerging new psychoactive substances (synthetic cannabinoids), manufacturing a new drug (liquid methamphetamine), and cultivating illegal drugs (marijuana) starting from the year 2013. These results are important for prevention, treatment and control, and for law enforcement in the West Bank. Policies, strategies and action plans in the controlling new substances should be developed taking into account local and regional socioeconomic issues.|$|R

We conducted a series of ethnographic observations to attempt to characterize more fully the practice of shotgunning, the range of associated behaviors, and the settings and contexts in which this practice occurs. Shotguns may be seen as a form of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> which has close ties to sexual behaviors, and which has both pragmatic and interpersonal motivations, combining in a single phenomenon the potential direct and indirect risk of disease transmission by sexual, blood borne and respiratory routes. These data support the need to develop and evaluate comprehensive risk reduction interventions, which take into consideration the relationships between interpersonal and sexual behaviors and specific forms of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Substance abuse Crack cocaine Tuberculosis HIV-infection 'Shotgun'...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{correlation}} between imprisonment and problematic <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> A series of studies has shown that <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in prison is now commonplace and that many inmates come into custody with severe <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> problems. At {{least half of the}} European Union’s 356, 000 prison population has a history of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> The harmful effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and especially <b>high-risk</b> behaviors, which occur in prisons, are well documented. Research into <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in prisons has found that imprisonment impacts on an individual’s pattern of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> in prison is usually carried out in a hurried secret fashion with little regard for safety and many drug users inject in prison, some for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{investigating}} the labor-market effects of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> have consistently found a positive relation between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and earnings. These analyses have, however, ignored the potential relationship between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and human-capital formation. This paper examines {{the effect of}} <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> during adolescence on formal educational attainment using a sample drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey Youth Cohort. The probability of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is estimated across racial groups according to three categories; use of any illicit <b>drug,</b> <b>use</b> including hard <b>drugs,</b> and <b>use</b> of only marijuana. Fitted values for the probability of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are calculated and entered into a regression framework to estimate the number of school years completed. The empirical results indicate that all three categories of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are associated with significant negative impacts on educational attainment after controlling for individual differences in personal endowments and socioeconomic characteristics. On average, adolescent <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is found to reduce eventual educational attainment by about 1 year, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that previous studies that focus only on the direct effects of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on earnings may reflect a statistical bias that leads to an overstatement of {{the positive effects of}} <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on earnings. ...|$|R
