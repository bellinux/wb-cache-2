40|$|The larvae {{of coastal}} species {{interact}} with nearshore currents that {{are complex and}} can alter dispersal. I investigated two sites in southern Oregon with different nearshore hydrodynamics: the first site, Sunset Bay, is a small cove with a topographic front that extends across the mouth during upwelling-favorable winds. Using holey sock drogues at 1. 5 m and 5. 5 m depths and surface drifters at 10 cm depth, I found that, when the front was present, water at 1. 5 m was retained within the bay whereas water was exchanged across the front {{at a depth of}} 5. 5 m. Surface drifters indicated a surface convergence. Surface plankton tows on either side and within the frontal convergence (a shore-parallel <b>foam</b> <b>line)</b> found significantly higher concentrations of barnacle cyprids, crab megalopae and zoea, polychaete larvae, platyhelminthes juveniles, isopods, amphipods, harpacticoid copepods, and fish eggs. Crustacean nauplii (barnacle, euphausiid, and copepod) and calanoid copepods were not concentrated in the convergence, and when the front and <b>foam</b> <b>line</b> were absent, no taxa were concentrated. Plankton tows taken within the <b>foam</b> <b>line</b> as it dissipated shoreward during a wind-reversal event found that concentrations of cyprids, megalopae, and gastropod veligers remained high as the <b>foam</b> <b>line</b> moved, suggesting that it acts as a moving convergence propagating competent larvae shoreward. I measured settlement of two taxa at Sunset Bay and Shore Acres, an open-coast site < 2 km away. Barnacle settlement measured every other day from June-September 2013 was significantly cross-correlated with the maximum daily tidal height at lags of - 2 days at Sunset Bay and + 2 and + 4 days at Shore Acres. Settlement was also significantly negatively cross-correlated with wave height at a lag of - 4 days at Sunset Bay. Coralline algae settlement measured during eight 48 -hr periods in July-August 2013 was significantly negatively correlated with wave height (n = 8, R 2 = 0. 76, P = 0. 0049) at Shore Acres but not at Sunset Bay. Despite the close proximity of the Sunset Bay and Shore Acres sites, settlement patterns differed between taxa, suggesting that differences in nearshore hydrodynamics might affect the supply of water and larvae to shore.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using airborne remote sensing to locate the Rhine plume front. Interest in fronts arises from the desire to predict the fate of pollutants and biological nutrients discharged from rivers into the open sea. Observations were made during flights over the Dutch coastal waters using a vertically-mounted video camera and a side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) designed for oil slick detection. Comparison of radar images with visual observations of the sea colour discontinuity and <b>foam</b> <b>line</b> establish that fronts can indeed be detected by SLAR because of high radar backscatter along the convergence line, where the fresh water jet impinges on saltier water. This provides a sound basis for future investigations using Synthetic Aperture Radar as mounted on ERS- 1. An estimation of errors is given, identifying priorities for improvement of the technique. The accuracy achieved is considered sufficient for the validation of hydrodynamic models...|$|E
40|$|Six sets {{of field}} {{measurements}} of runup resulting from both wind waves and swell {{were made on}} a uniform sand beach. Waves were recorded simultaneously directly offshore at a point outside the surf zone. Each individual runup was correlated with a specific wave, using a traveltime plot. Runup occurrences were always found to be fewer in number than wave occurrences, particularly when wind waves were present. Large variations in the runup resulting from waves of a given height were found to exist. These variations in height and ratio of runup to waves were caused {{in large part by}} the interaction of successive foam lines. Interaction occurred in the form of retardation by backwash of preceding waves, overtaking by a following <b>foam</b> <b>line,</b> and overriding by a small unbroken wave. It is concluded that the complicated nature of runup resulting from ordinary sea and swell makes it difficult to predict runup accurately from laboratory studies. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{from the}} Atlantic Ocean into the inlet channel of the Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, delimited by two west-converging breakwaters, moves a tidal prism {{of up to}} 110 Mm 3. The {{associated}} velocity field controls the formation and movement of foam lines and turbid water masses. Observation by airborne 35 mm photography and direct measurements of surface water temperature, salinity and suspended solids concentration give {{a view of the}} circulation in the littoral zone, which is important as this area is soon to receive effluent from an outfall located c. 3 km to the north. On the flood tide turbid water is diverted from the north-south direction of the littoral drift into the channel. On the ebb this turbid water is pushed offshore by a jet flowing west and south-west from the channel. The surface water temperature inside the channel mouth is lower on the north side where the salinity is less reduced by dilution with lagoon water. During the flood tide the water flowing from the north rotates to the east, forced by flow from the south-west along the axis of the channel. This motion holds the less dense water on the south side and causes intense vertical mixing on the N side. The frontal convergence of these two water masses is usually marked at the surface by a clear <b>foam</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{dynamics}} in the permanently open Kowie Estuary, {{in the warm}} temperate region of South Africa was investigated. The composition, abundance, distribution and seasonality of larval fishes were studied over a two year period between 2004 and 2006. Additionally, tidal exchange of ichthyoplankton {{and the use of}} frontal zones in the mouth region of the estuary were also explored between 2008 and 2009. Temporal and spatial trends in occurrence of larval fishes within the estuary and associated marina were obtained from data collected seasonally using boat-based plankton netting at 14 sampling stations {{along the length of the}} estuary. A total of 11 128 larval fishes were collected, representing 23 families and 38 taxa. Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant fish families, contributing 47. 0 % and 24. 7 % respectively to the total catch. Estuarine resident species dominated the overall catch (91 %). A notable absence of older stage larvae and early juveniles characterised the artificial channels of the marina and estuary mouth region. This was attributed to the absence of a shallow, marginal water habitat typical of successful estuarine nursery areas. Tidal exchange of larval fishes was investigated in the Kowie Estuary using a new technique. A set of drifting light traps were set repetitively on the ebb and flood tide every second night for two consecutive 14 day periods during the peak estuarine recruitment period. A total of 553 larval fishes were caught during the study, representing nine families and 26 species. Blenniidae and Clupeidae dominated the catches. Family and species occurrence changed with tide state. Species richness (d) and diversity (H’) varied with tide and was highest on flood tides. Estuary-dependent species, such as Omobranchus woodii were more dominant on flood tides, whilst larvae of marine-spawned species, such as Sardinops sagax, were dominant on the ebb tide. Light trap catches yielded a different composition in terms of development stage / size and species, when compared to towed net studies. Towed plankton nets were again used to study the shear fronts that characterise the mouth region of the canalised Kowie Estuary. It was hypothesised that the convergence zone of the front provides feeding opportunities for ichthyoplankton. Ichthyoplankton, zooplankton and phytoplankton was collected from within and immediately outside of the convergence zone during frontal conditions. Species specific distribution trends emerged from this study. Postflexion larvae and early juvenile stages of the estuary dependent Mugilidae were only present in the <b>foam</b> <b>line</b> of the convergence zones. Some known predators of ichthyoplankton were also present in slightly higher numbers in the convergence zone (isopods) while other predators such as mysid shrimps, chaetognaths and cnidarians were more abundant out of the convergence zone. It appears that these zones may provide access to temporary food patches in the lower estuary but will be accompanied by a trade-off with increased isopod predators. The Kowie Estuary is a heavily impacted system and lack of adequate freshwater supply; artificial channelling and pollution ultimately have a negative impact of the success of this system as a nursery area. Rehabilitation of marginal areas in the lower estuary and marina is suggested as remedial action to re-establish the integrity of the nursery function this system could offer...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform aeroacoustic {{measurements}} in hard-walled, closed section wind tunnels is desirable {{for the development of}} quiet aircraft, to supplement dedicated acoustic testing in open-jet anechoic facilities. One of the restrictions of such testing is the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when using arrays of microphones mounted on the wind tunnel wall. This can limit the ability to discern acoustic sources which are near, or below, the background noise level of the facility. Increasing the number of sensors can help to improve SNR. In this paper we investigate how sensor mounting details can help to improve SNR. A systematic study of microphone mounting strategies is presented. The performance of individual microphone recessing, using straight and countersunk holes, is investigated and compared with flush-mounted microphone performance. The effects of placing the microphones out of the flow by recessing the whole array behind a cloth are described. A parametric study of the effect of recess depth and cloth type has been carried out, along with the effect of adding an acoustic foam liner within the recess enclosure. Results show that recessing individual microphones by the depth of the microphone diameter (d) up to 2 d can provide up to 3 dB improvement. Increasing the recess depth beyond 2 d provided up to 10 dB improvement, with recessing to 10 d depth providing up to 20 dB improvement. The greatest improvements occur below 25 kHz, although there is improvement across the 0 to 48 kHz range. The effect of countersunk recessing was either no improvement, or an increase in the background noise level of up to 20 dB, possibly due to cavity mode oscillations within the recess aperture. Significant differences in SNR were observed between Kevlar cloths of different densities, and with a silk covering. A reduction in background noise level of 5 to 10 dB was observed when acoustic <b>foam</b> <b>lining</b> was added {{to the floor of the}} recessed array.
