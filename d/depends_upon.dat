5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> protein synthesis, while the second <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> both gene transcription and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E

5|$|Because {{surface tension}} {{manifests itself in}} various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement.

5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> {{the needs of}} a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would be appropriate to show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|The {{interference}} pattern {{between the two}} beams when the light is recombined at the observer <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the transit times over the two paths, {{and can be used}} to calculate the speed of light {{as a function of the}} speed of the water.|$|E

5|$|The time to {{recharge}} Lake Missoula <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> {{the level at}} which the dam is breached releasing the flood as well as upon the adjusted precipitation rate in the drainages flowing into Lake Missoula.

5|$|According to Jain texts, {{the fruits}} of himsā (violence) <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the {{severity}} of passions {{at the time of}} commencement of such an act. One may be responsible for the sinful act of himsā without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act. Also, when two persons commit the act of himsā jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma), may be grave for one person and mild for the other.|$|E
5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E

5000|$|Cheyenne verbs take {{different}} object agreement endings <b>depending</b> <b>upon</b> the animacy of {{the subject}} and the transitivity of the verb itself. Intransitive verbs take endings <b>depending</b> <b>upon</b> the animacy of their subject, whereas transitive verbs take endings that <b>depend</b> <b>upon</b> the animacy of their object. All verbs can therefore be broadly categorized into one of four classes: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Instransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA) and Transitive Inanimate (TI).

5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> stylistic comparisons.

5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation {{is the legal}} authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government.

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E

5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|Progression through Paper Mario <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> {{interaction}} with the game's non-player characters (NPCs), who will often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip {{a limited number of}} badges at a time. Princess Peach is playable at particular points in the game as a recurring sidequest. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.|$|E
