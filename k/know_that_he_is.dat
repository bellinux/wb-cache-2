Lucas is a {{neuroscience}} major in his senior year; he has fought for transgender rights for his entire college career. He has not yet started hormone replacement therapy, and is cautious about it. Lucas' parents are divorced; his mother and brother <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> trans, but his father does not. Lucas plays guitar in a punk band, and lives in an apartment with his friend Kasey, a trans {{man who has been}} on HRT for eight months.|$|E
5|$|At Branga, Shiva {{learns that}} the only person aware of the {{medicine}} recipe is a bandit named Parashuram, who leads a secluded life and kills any man coming near his abode in the jungles. Shiva and his men defeat Parashuram, and to his surprise comes to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a Vasudev, the group of scholars who have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also surprised to see Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine {{to the people of}} Branga and leaves for Kashi with Shiva. At Kashi, Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who tried to attack on Sati and as the killer of Brahaspati. Severely angered, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, three lions attack them and Ganesh becomes severely injured while saving Kartik. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati, who disgusted with Daksha's deeds, asks him to leave Kashi and go back to Meluha.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden, but the story differs in several ways. Published by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1864, the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried {{and they have a}} new child. For the sake of his wife's happiness, he never lets her <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> alive. The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns {{on the day of the}} wedding. Rather than announce himself, he attempts to leave and dies in the process, his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her. The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John's true death at the climax. The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly, making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed.|$|E

500|$|Cynicism {{came to be}} seen as an {{idealised}} form of Stoicism, a view {{which led}} Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse. [...] According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic [...] "must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered." [...] Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: [...] "consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind." ...|$|E

Bishop states that while the constant flux of HCE's character and attributes may lead us to consider him as an [...] "anyman," [...] he argues that [...] "the sheer density of certain repeated details and concerns allows us to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a particular, real Dubliner." [...] The common critical consensus of HCE's fixed character is summarised by Bishop as being [...] "an older Protestant male, of Scandinavian lineage, connected with the pubkeeping business somewhere in the neighbourhood of Chapelizod, who has a wife, a daughter, and two sons." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1623, Charles I (then Prince of Wales) {{returned}} to Portsmouth from his travels in France and Spain. Five years later, Charles' unpopular military adviser, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, was {{stabbed to death}} in an Old Portsmouth pub by war veteran John Felton. Felton never attempted to escape and was caught walking through the streets when soldiers confronted him, to which he responded: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dead, for I had the force of forty men when I struck the blow". Felton was then hanged, and his body was chained to a gibbet on Southsea Common {{as a warning to}} others. The murder took place in the Greyhound public house on High Street, which is now private and called Buckingham House; it bears a commemorative plaque.|$|E

There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{was introduced in}} Batman #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham's prominent citizens (including Mayor Henry Claridge). Although the police protect Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face; Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison. The Joker commits whimsical, brutal crimes for reasons that, in Batman's words, [...] "make sense to him alone". Detective Comics #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name [...] "Joker", from the playing card figure he came to resemble. The Joker's Silver-Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's [...] "The Joker's Millions". In this story the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, afraid to let Gotham's citizens <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> penniless and was tricked out of his fortune. The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal psychopath. [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" [...] has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him; in [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] the character chemically adds his face to Gotham's fish (hoping to profit from a copyright), killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.|$|E
500|$|In Oedipus Rex, Oedipus is the protagonist. Oedipus' {{infanticide}} {{is planned}} by his parents, Laius and Jocasta, to avert him from fulfilling a prophecy; in truth, the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on {{through a series}} of intermediaries to a childless couple, who adopt him not knowing his history. Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracle's prophecy of him, that he would kill his father and marry his mother; Oedipus attempts to flee his fate without harming those he knows as his parents (at this point, he does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> adopted). Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants; Oedipus and the man fight, and Oedipus kills the man (who was his father, Laius, although neither knew at the time). He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx and in the process, [...] marries the widowed queen, his mother Jocasta. [...] Thus the stage is set for horror. When the truth comes out, following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi, Jocasta commits suicide, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes. At the end of the play, order is restored. This restoration is seen when Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king, and also when Oedipus, before going off to exile, asks Creon {{to take care of his}} children. [...] Oedipus's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father's actions.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

2500|$|In his 1962 work The Prophets Abraham Joshua Heschel {{points out}} that prophecy {{is not the only}} {{instrument}} of God to change the hearts of Israel, to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> God. He tells how the prophet Jeremiah complains that Israel is circumcised in body but [...] "uncircumcised in heart" [...] (9:26), that Jeremiah says [...] "wash your heart from wickedness" [...] (4:14). Heschel analyses that, while the prophet can only give Israel a new word, it is God himself who will give man a new heart: The [...] "new covenant" [...] will accomplish the complete transformation of every individual.|$|E

Habibul Bashar, the Bangladesh captain, said of the dropped catch, [...] "If he had taken it we could have seen a different situation, but I must say he tried hard and you all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a whole-hearted cricketer".

2500|$|... "In the Hall of the Mountain King" [...] {{plays a major}} plot {{point in}} Fritz Lang's early sound film M. Peter Lorre's {{character}} of child killer Hans Beckert whistles the tune whenever he is overcome with the urge to commit murder. However, Lorre himself could not whistle – it is actually Lang who is heard. The film {{was one of the}} first to use a leitmotif, associating [...] "In the Hall of the Mountain King" [...] with the Lorre character. Later in the film, the mere sound of the song lets the audience <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> nearby, off-screen. This association of a musical theme with a particular character or situation, a technique borrowed from opera, became a staple in film.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{up on the}} beggar's advice, {{the young}} man confronts his father's ridicule, but {{eventually}} persuades him into giving his blessing and lending him his old items. The horse itself is identified using a test of character suggested by the old woman: {{it is the only}} one in the stable who will approach and eat off a tray of embers. The prince is initially disappointed by the stud's poor condition, but is pleasantly surprised when the animal [...] "shakes three times" [...] and turns into the most beautiful of its kind. There follows a discovery that the horse can talk to his new master, and test rides which see it leaping to the clouds and then to the Moon. Armed with such powers, the prince then reaches the bridge and braves the ruse, being congratulated by his emotional father, and receiving the bear skin as a trophy. As parting words, the father lets his son <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to beware [...] "of the red man, and especially of the bald one".|$|E
2500|$|Sothern's {{next great}} role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's The Crushed Tragedian (1878, {{originally}} named The Prompter's Box) at the Haymarket. [...] The Era admired [...] "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" [...] of his portrayal. [...] He next appeared in The Hornet's Nest by Byron at the Haymarket. [...] The Crushed Tragedian {{was not a}} great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer raved, [...] "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and {{it is as though}} he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous." [...] In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play Money as Sir Frederick Blount.|$|E
2500|$|He {{suspected}} his father, Michael, {{suffered from}} this [...] "sickness of the spirit" [...] {{because of something}} he had done {{as a young man}} or while grieving the loss of his first wife. Lee M. Hollander thought he was afraid he had committed the Eternal sin, one that can never be forgiven. Kierkegaard called his gaining knowledge of his father's sin the [...] "great earthquake". Maybe he heard someone say that cursing God was the unforgivable sin or that fornication was the unforgivable sin. [...] Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's anxiety and others like him who believe that God shuts his door against them. He asks, “How does a person get to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the greatest sinner?” Kierkegaard started in Either/Or with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to The Concept of Anxiety where he remarked; [...] "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness." [...] His father was only twelve when he cursed God and didn't have faith that God would forgive him. Goethe had the same problem because he had many experiences while he was still young.|$|E
