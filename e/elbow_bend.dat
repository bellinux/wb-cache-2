The {{pressure drop in}} the vertical inlet tangent showed some significant differences to that found for straight vertical pipe. This {{was caused by the}} <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> partially choking the inflow resulting in a build-up of pressure and liquid in the vertical inlet riser and differences {{in the structure of the}} flow regimes when compared to the straight vertical pipe. The horizontal outlet tangent by contrast gave data in general agreement with literature even to exhibiting a drag reduction region at low liquid rates and gas velocities between 1 and 2 m s- 1. The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> pressure drop was best correlated in terms of l(e) /d determined using the actual pressure loss in the inlet vertical riser. The data showed a general increase with fluid rates that tapered off at high fluid rates and exhibited a negative pressure region at low rates. The latter was attributed to the flow being smoothly accommodated by the bend when it passed from slug flow in the riser to smooth stratified flow in the outlet tangent.

The results were {{more complex than}} corresponding two phase data. The pressure drop recorded for the two tangent legs sometimes showed significant variations to the straight pipe data. In most cases this variation was caused by differences in the flow regimes between the two systems. The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> tended to constrict the flow presented by the vertical inlet tangent leg while sometimes acting as a wave and droplet generator for the horizontal outlet tangent leg.

The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> pressure drop was best presented as l e / d the equivalent length to diameter ratio using the actual total pressure drop in the vertical inlet tangent leg. Generally l e / d values rose with gas rate, but exhibited an increasingly complex relation with f o the oil to liquid volumetric ratio as liquid rate was increased. A significant maximum in l e / d was in evidence around the inversion from water dominated to oil dominated flows. Several models are presented to predict the data. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{describes}} a three part analysis {{to characterize the}} interaction between the female upper extremity and a helicopter cockpit side airbag system and to develop dynamic hyperextension injury criteria for the female elbow joint. Part I involved a series of 10 experiments with an original Army Black Hawk helicopter side airbag. A 5 th percentile female Hybrid III instrumented upper extremity was used to demonstrate side airbag upper extremity loading. Two out of the 10 tests resulted in high <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments of 128 Nm and 144 Nm. Part II included dynamic hyperextension tests on 24 female cadaver elbow joints. The energy source was a drop tower utilizing a three-point bending configuration to apply <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments matching the previously conducted side airbag tests. Post-test necropsy showed that 16 of the 24 elbow joint tests resulted in injuries. Injury severity ranged from minor cartilage damage to more moderate joint dislocations and severe transverse fractures of the distal humerus. Peak <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments ranged from 42. 4 Nm to 146. 3 Nm. Peak bending moment proved to be a significant indicator of any elbow injury (p = 0. 02) as well as elbow joint dislocation (p = 0. 01). Logistic regression analyses were used to develop single and multiple variate injury risk functions. Using peak moment data for the entire test population, a 50 % risk of obtaining any elbow injury was found at 56 Nm while a 50 % risk of sustaining an elbow joint dislocation was found at 93 Nm for the female population. These results indicate that the peak <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments achieved in Part I are associated with a greater than 90 % risk for elbow injury. Subsequently, the airbag was re-designed in an effort to mitigate this a...|$|R

This velocity command is then resolved into individual joint rotational velocities in the robot arm to effect the motion. However, the usual resolved-rate equations become singular when the robot arm is straightened.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the structures of the antigen-binding fragments (Fab) of mouse monoclonal immunoglobulins by X-ray crystallography, is presented. The family of immunoglobulins studied, Gloops 1 - 5, possess the ability to bind to both the peptide antigen and the parent protein: Hen Egg-white Lysozyme. The Gloop 1 and Gloop 4 Fabs were generated by proteolytic cleavage of the antibody, and crystallisation trials yielded crystals of uncomplexed Fabs of both species. Attempts to grow Fab:antigen complex crystals proved unsuccessful. Partial purification of the heterogeneous Gloop 4 Fab {{was found to be}} essential for the success of the crystallisations. Data were collected on crystal forms of Gloop 1, Gloop 2 and Gloop 4 on an area detector. The structures of three Gloop 2 crystal forms were solved by the molecular replacement technique, using models consisting of Fab domain pairs. Two of the crystal forms were refined by molecular dynamics methods at maximum resolutions of 3. 3 Å and 2. 8 Å, and the third by rigid body methods alone at 3. 5 Å resolution. Analysis of the Gloop 2 structures between the crystal forms and with other Fabs indicated no atypical features in the domains. The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> of the Gloop 2 Fabs differed by up to 7 °. The relative association of variable and constant domain pairs was also seen to vary between the Fabs. The changes in domain pairing caused significant differences in the relative disposition of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), although there was no evidence for conformational change within individual CDRs. The Gloop 2 combining site is dominated by a groove of approximate dimensions 12 Åx 9 Åx 7 Å, containing many aromatic side-chains and a pair of glutamic acid residues in analogous positions to a those found in a FabrHen egg-white Lysozyme complex. </p...|$|E
40|$|Material wear due to {{erosion-corrosion}} in slurry {{transport equipment}} is prevalent in process {{industries such as}} the oilsands industry. Damage to equipment can cost a typical oilsands industry nearly £ 200 million annually, along with an associated health and safety risk to man and environment [6]. New materials are continuously developed in order to endure wear under adverse erosion-corrosion conditions better and laboratory testing offers a good option to test new materials prior to commission. Traditionally {{the performance of a}} set of new materials are assessed based on their overall wear behavior in a laboratory test and is ranked accordingly, with the best performing material generally used for application. However, due to differences in prevailing conditions on the material surface and geometrical variations between actual and test geometry, accurately correlating data from a laboratory test to field scenario can be highly complex. Also the ranking system is not capable of predicting wear profiles for specific conditions and hence a new wear prediction method was developed and is presented in this thesis. This method has been developed, using a combination of standard laboratory based experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. As a starting point only wear due to erosion is considered and this thesis provides validation of such an approach. The method involves two stages in which (i) a universal wear map is generated for the material and abrasive combination in question using a standard laboratory test Uet impingement test) to generate a wear scar on a simple geometry. The local wear rate from this is interpreted using a CFD simulation of the test to generate a map giving local wear as a function of particle impact velocity and angle; (ii) a CFD solution is calculated for a series of different erosion configurations giving the particle impact data at each point on the surface. The wear map from the first stage is then used to give the local wear rate. The power of this method is that once a material-specific map has been generated then wear on any geometry can be calculated through the simulation of flow using CFD. As validation of this, wear on a typical plant geometry (1. 50 90 0 <b>elbow</b> <b>bend)</b> is undertaken and the general applicability of this method is demonstrated.

5000|$|For small arms, the way {{in which}} the shooter {{perceives}} the recoil, or kick, can have a significant impact on the shooter's experience and performance. For example, a gun that is said to [...] "kick like a mule" [...] is going to be approached with trepidation, and the shooter may anticipate the recoil and flinch in anticipation as the shot is released. This leads to the shooter jerking the trigger, rather than pulling it smoothly, and the jerking motion is almost certain to disturb the alignment of the gun and may result in a miss. The shooter may also be physically injured by firing a weapon generating recoil in excess of what the body can safely absorb or restrain; perhaps getting hit in the eye by the rifle scope, hit in the forehead by a handgun as the <b>elbow</b> <b>bends</b> under the force, or soft tissue damage to the shoulder, wrist and hand; and these results vary for individuals.
