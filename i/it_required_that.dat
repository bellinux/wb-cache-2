5|$|Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector {{had been}} closely linked {{with that of}} Rochdale and Saddleworth {{in the north and}} east; it was a woollen {{manufacturing}} district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. To ensure that the woollen trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> the deceased were to be buried in woollen garments.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{authorized}} DOE {{to provide}} up to 1,900 {{metric tons of}} temporary storage capacity for spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> spent fuel in temporary storage facilities be moved to permanent storage within three years after a permanent waste repository went into operation. Costs of temporary storage would be paid by fees collected from electric utilities using the storage.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian {{literature}} {{continued to}} {{flourish in the}} early Soviet years, when nearly all literary trends were approved (the most important literary figures of that time were Mykola Khvylovy, Valerian Pidmohylny, Mykola Kulish, Mykhayl Semenko and some others). These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives {{as well as many}} others were killed by NKVD as part of the Great Purge. In general around 223 writers were repressed by what was known as the Executed Renaissance. These repressions were part of Stalin's implemented policy of socialist realism. The doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the Ukrainian language, but <b>it</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> writers follow a certain style in their works.|$|E

25|$|The {{broadcast}} flag {{concept was}} developed by Fox Broadcasting in 2001, and {{was supported by the}} MPAA and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A ruling in May 2005, by a United States courts of appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as time-shifting. It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.|$|E
25|$|The whites {{dealt with}} this problem of {{potential}} political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, {{nearly half of the}} state population. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish–American War was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically. In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate. White, one-party rule was solidified.|$|E
500|$|These problems, {{together}} {{with a desire to}} enhance the deterrent effect of the death penalty, resulted in the passage of the Murder Act 1752. [...] <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> [...] "every murderer shall, after execution, either be dissected or hung in chains". [...] Dissection was generally viewed as [...] "a fate worse than death"; giving judges the ability to substitute gibbeting with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror. [...] While the Act gave anatomists statutory access to many more cadavers than were previously available, it proved insufficient. [...] Attempting to bolster the supply, some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners, while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows, sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway.|$|E

[...] It required the use of the country's name on the reverse, and of [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] somewhere on the coin. It allowed the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] to appear on American coinage—continuing permission granted in the Act of March 3, 1865, which had authorized the three-cent nickel. The 1873 law allowed for the redemption of current or obsolete base-metal coinage by the Treasury when presented in lots of $20 or more, continuing a provision enacted in 1871.|$|E

Franco was initially inclined to live in the Royal Palace, but was disabused of this notion by Ramón Serrano Súñer. Franco instead chose the Palacio Real de El Pardo, where he settled in March 1940 following its restoration. The Francos passed their summers at a home in Meirás, and fishing on their yacht Azor.

2500|$|In {{response}} to Madero's letter to action, Pascual Orozco (a wealthy mining baron) and Chihuahua Governor Abraham González formed a powerful military union in the north, taking military control of several northern Mexican cities with other revolutionary leaders, including Pancho Villa. Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won Ciudad Juárez. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with Díaz. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> Díaz abdicate his rule and {{be replaced by}} Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the United States and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called [...] "Orozquistas"—also called the Colorados ("Red Flaggers")—after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions. The rural working class, which had supported Madero, now took up arms against him in support of Orozco.|$|E
2500|$|Caird was {{a complex}} figure, which makes {{any attempt to}} reduce his life and work into a short survey hazardous. However, {{taking into account the}} {{concerns}} expressed here, certain things may confidently be said of him - most principally that he was a scholar's scholar, and yet one who was (paradoxically) never a pure academic who enjoyed the sequestered safety of his study. His pastoral temperament was frequently at the fore, and for him <b>it</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> he do the double duty of preacher-scholar. [...] "To know George you had to hear him preach, for here became apparent one of the great strengths of his life. It was clearly the same man who conducted advanced seminars and helped graduate students to see through the complexities of their work. Many of those who went to his lectures remarked not only on the vigorous academic discipline they were invited to share, but on the direct relationship they were encouraged to see between honest probing and the preaching of the Gospel" [...] (Donald Sykes).|$|E
2500|$|The Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) was {{a federal}} {{executive}} order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate {{on the basis}} of race or religion. It assisted African Americans in obtaining jobs in industry. Under pressure from A. Philip Randolph's growing March on Washington Movement, on June 25, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) by signing Executive Order 8802. It said [...] "there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin". In 1943 Roosevelt greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order, #9346. <b>It</b> <b>required</b> <b>that</b> all government contracts have a non-discrimination clause. FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and women on the job front. During the war the federal government operated airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other facilities that employed millions. FEPC rules applied and guaranteed equality of employment rights. These facilities shut down when the war ended. In the private sector the FEPC was generally successful in enforcing non-discrimination in the North, it did not attempt to challenge segregation in the South, and in the border region its intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers.|$|E
