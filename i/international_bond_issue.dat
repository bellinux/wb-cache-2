40|$|Contrary to {{widespread}} expectation, debt renegotiations {{in the era}} of bond finance have generally been quick and involved little litigation. We present a model that rationalizes the initial fears and offers interpretations for why they did not materialize. When the exchange offer is sufficiently attractive vis-Ã -vis holding out, full participation can be an equilibrium. Legal innovations such as minimum participation thresholds and defensive exit consents helped coordinate creditors and avoid litigation. Unlike CACs, exit consents can be exploited to force high haircuts on creditors, but the ability of creditors to coordinate to block exit consents can limit overly aggressive use.

Although {{the external}} current account shifted to a moderate deficit, mainly reflecting the recovery in imports, export performance has been robust, and {{gross international reserves}} are now about three-fourths their pre-crisis level. The authorities’ program appropriately focuses on fiscal consolidation keeping inflation low through prudent monetary policy, promoting sound credit flows in a strengthened financial system, and other growth-oriented reforms.

This period was marked by low Japanese interest rates that led some investors to pursue "carry trades," which consisted of funding investments in higher interest rate currencies with low interest rate, yen-denominated obligations. In principle, bond issuers that have flexibility in their funding currency could also conduct a carry-trade strategy by funding in yen during this low interest rate period.

It argues that standard determinants such as monetary performance and financial openness are at best imperfect indicators of a currency’s stability prospects, because the issuer’s promise of stability is not exogenously enforceable. The paper advocates an enforcement approach to international currencies that make explicit the underlying incentive incompatibilities. Additional enforcement determinants of currency internationalization are identified. The model is estimated using time-series cross-sectional analysis for three data sets. Monetary performance-related standard determinants fail to exhibit explanatory power, whereas the enforcement determinants are strongly significant and robust.

The conceptual merits and key preconditions of MSD are first reviewed.

We find that emerging markets do not satisfy the preconditions for the successful implementation of a MSD policy. Therefore, efforts to enhance market discipline should first focus on satisfying these preconditions and improving the overall incentive environment and market infrastructure.

Since the late 1990 s, credit spreads on Latin American issues have declined broadly inline with those in other emerging markets. Recent empirical analysis has explained this phenomenon by identifying critical macroeconomic factors, including the reduction in systematic risk in individual markets, although the structural models from the theoretical finance literature also predict the importance of key default and interest rate variables. This contribution adds to the understanding of these issues by investigating the application of structural models to the Latin American setting, one historically characterized by excessive volatility and susceptibility to episodes of default. credit spreads, long-run dynamics, Latin America, sovereign bonds, cointegration...|$|R

2500|$|Turkey's {{impressive}} {{economic performance}} in the 1980s won high marks from Wall Street's credit-rating agencies. In 1992 and 1993, the government used these ratings to attract funds to cover its budget deficits. <b>International</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> over this period amounted to US$7.5 billion. These capital flows helped maintain the overvalued exchange rate. In a market economy, {{a high level of}} government borrowing should translate into higher domestic interest rates and even possibly [...] "crowd out" [...] private-sector borrowers, thereby eventually slowing economic growth. But the government's foreign borrowing took the pressure off domestic interest rates and actually spurred more private-sector borrowing in an already overheated economy. Sensing an easy profit opportunity during this period, commercial banks borrowed at world interest rates and lent at Turkey's higher domestic rates without fear of a depreciating currency. As a result, Turkey's foreign short-term debt rose sharply. External and internal confidence in the government's ability to manage the impending balance of payments crisis waned, compounding economic difficulties.|$|R

He finds that strong macroeconomic fundamentals in a country [...] such as low domestic inflation rates, improved terms of trade, and increased foreign assets [...] are associated with lower yield spreads. By contrast, higher yield spreads are associated with weak liquidity variables in a country, such as a high debt-to-GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio, a low ratio of foreign reserves to GDP, a low (high) export (import) growth rate, and a high debt-service ratio. At the same time, external shocks [...] as measured by the international interest rate [...] matter little in the determination of bond spreads.

40|$|Currency {{choice in}} <b>international</b> <b>bond</b> {{issuance}} 1 Aggregate issuance of <b>international</b> <b>bonds</b> {{is found to}} be significantly higher in strong currencies than in weak ones. The mix of currencies is also found to be influenced by interest rate differentials, with greater issuance in higher-yielding currencies, and by the amount of home country issuance. Taken together, the results suggest that both the investor’s and the issuer’s preferences determine currency choice in <b>international</b> <b>bond</b> issuance. JEL classification: G 110, G 150, G 320. The international debt securities market 2 brings together borrowers and lenders with diverse risk profiles and risk appetites. This special feature investigates the determinants of the currency denomination of international debt issuance. Specifically, it examines the share of aggregate issuance of <b>international</b> <b>bonds</b> and notes that is denominated in selected currencies, and estimates the impact on these currency shares of a number of plausible factors. The international market is an attractive one for studying currency choice issues, because issuers are likely to be well known outside their national boundaries, and investors are likely to be comparatively well informed. As a result, asymmetric information regarding credit quality will be relatively low. The key finding is that there is more issuance in a given currency when it is strong relative to historical averages and when long-term interest rates in that currency are high relative to those available in other major currencies. These findings hold even when controlling for demand for investable funds in that currency, as proxied by the growth of investment, or the level of home country issuance. The preferences of investors appear to play just as important a role as those of issuers in determining the terms and conditions of <b>international</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|R

40|$|The IMF {{attempts}} to catalyze and stabilize private capital flows to emerging markets by providing public monitoring and emergency finance. In analyzing its role we contrast cases where banks and bondholders do the lending. Banks {{have a natural}} advantage in monitoring and creditor coordination, while bonds have superior risk sharing characteristics. Consistent with this assumption, banks reduce spreads as they obtain more information through repeat transactions with borrowers. By comparison, repeat borrowing has little influence in bond markets, where publicly available information dominates. But spreads on bonds are lower when they are issued in conjunction with IMF-supported programs, as if {{the existence of a}} program conveyed positive information to bondholders. The influence of IMF monitoring in bond markets is especially pronounced for countries vulnerable to liquidity crises.

40|$|At the April 2003 {{meeting of}} the International Monetary and Financial Committees, {{it was decided to}} further {{encourage}} the contractual approach to smoothing the process of sovereign debt restructuring by encouraging the more widespread use of collective action clauses (CACs) in <b>international</b> <b>bonds.</b> This decision was shaped partly by Mexico''s successful launch of a bond subject to New York law but featuring CACs, and by subsequent issues with similar provisions from other emerging market countries. This paper reviews the developments leading up to that event, its implications, and prospects for the future. It asks whether we can expect to see additional issuance by emerging markets of bonds featuring CACs, whether such a trend would in fact help {{to make the world a}} safer financial place, and what additional steps might be taken to further enhance modalities for crisis resolution.

40|$|We {{test for}} the {{existence}} of a moral hazard effect attributable to official crisis lending by analyzing the evolution of sovereign bond spreads in emerging markets before and after the Russian crisis. The nonbailout of Russia in August 1998 is interpreted as an event that decreased the perceived probability of future crisis lending to emerging markets. In the presence of moral hazard, such an event should raise not only the level of spreads, but also the sensitivity with which spreads reflect fundamentals as well as their cross-country dispersion. We find strong evidence for all three effects.

40|$|Includes bibliographyVersión preliminar, en otra fuente, ingresada en Biblioteca (101399) Abstract The {{internationalisation}} of {{the euro}} is in its initial stages {{and it is still}} difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding its scope and its implications for Latin America. Indeed, the emergence of an internationally used currency is slow and subject to inertial forces. Nonetheless, several fairly robust conclusions can be inferred from the results of the document. The most plausible medium- to long-term international scenario seems to be development of an asymmetrical duopoly between the euro and the dollar. In a context of scant international monetary cooperation, this scenario could lead to high volatility between the two main international currencies, which will be a powerful destabilising factor for third countries. In terms of official international reserves, the growing financial use of the single European currency and the development of Euroland capital markets should lead to greater diversification in favour {{of the euro}} in the medium and long term. Together with other factors, the growth of the euro bond market will tend to increase the pressure to widen and deepen the euro financial market and make it more liquid. This should favour the development of better conditions for both European and third-country participants. The geographic diversification strategy implemented by the European banks, and the boom in European foreign direct investment could also favour greater international use of the euro. For Latin America, the sustained increase in the share of euro-denominated <b>international</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues,</b> chiefly by the public sector, makes it necessary to consider policies for managing the currency composition of the external debt. On the other hand, the medium- to long-term consequences of an increasingly bipolar but asymmetrical international monetary system will have {{to be included in the}} Latin America national exchange rate policies, enhancing the possibility of adopting anchor baskets...|$|R

It fostered coordination among creditors, especially in cases of default, arranging successfully for many important debt restructurings, though failing persistently in a few cases. While a revamped creditor association might once again help facilitate creditor coordination, the relative appeal of defection over coordination is greater today than it was in the past. The CFB may have had an easier time than any comparable body would have today.
