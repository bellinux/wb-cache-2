Sampson describes this as [...] "mastery of the 'tacit knowledge' which enables a person to conform his behaviour to the patterns appropriate to the physical world he inhabits: to pour a liquid without spilling it, to use a skipping rope, to succeed in throwing a ball roughly where he wants it to go, etc." ...|$|E

50|$|Defining a {{particular}} aim for kinanthropometry is central for its full understanding. Ross et al. (1972) said “K is a scientific discipline that studies the body size, the proportionality, {{the performance of}} movement, the body composition and principal functions of the body. This so well cited definition is not completely exact as the last four words show. What are the kinanthropometric methods that truly {{tell us something about}} principal functions of the body? In principle an amount or distribution of fat mass or muscular mass could be correlated or show a level of causation with any disease. The morpho-physiological mechanisms involved in those explanations are big enigmas today. Few diseases are in practice diagnosed using anthropometric measures and body composition methods at any public health care system. The use of body composition outcomes for predicting health status due to their associations with a lot of physiological variables is valid. However, this purpose is not included within the kinanthropometric perspective because the absent of movement prediction's probability in those diagnoses. The countless uses of some of its fundamental methods have to be accepted but they should not change the theoretical core of the scientific discipline. On the other hand, this definition omits some important objectives of quantifying the body that are an indelible part of its frame; for example: the study of human shape using the method of the anthropometric somatotype of Carter and Heath (1990). Besides that, the performance of movement is why one studies the body size, proportionality, body composition, and human shape. It is confusing to write at the same level the performance of movement because then one never clearly portrays the purpose of the discipline, meaning that a <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the body is the sole purpose while you are mixing the real scope in the statement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Numerous {{measures}} {{are used for}} performance evaluation in machine learning. In predictive knowledge discovery, {{the most frequently used}} measure is classication accuracy. With new tasks being addressed in knowledge discovery, new measures appear. In <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> discovery, where induced rules are not primarily intended for classica-tion, new measures used are novelty in clausal and subgroup discovery, and support and condence in association rule learning. Additional mea-sures are needed as many <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> discovery tasks involve the induction of a large set of redundant rules and the problem is the ranking and ltering of the induced rule set. In this paper we develop a unifying view on some of the existing measures for predictive and de-scriptive induction. We provide a common terminology and notation by means of contingency tables. We demonstrate how to trade o these measures, by using what we call weighted relative accuracy. The paper furthermore demonstrates that many rule evaluation measures develo-ped for predictive knowledge discovery can be adapted to <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> discovery tasks. ...|$|E

40|$|Fuzzy {{membership}} function {{is an effective}} tool to represent relationship between soil and environment for predictive soil mapping. Usually construction of a fuzzy {{membership function}} requires knowledge on soil-landscape relationships obtained from local soil experts or from extensive field samples. For areas with no soil survey experts and no extensive soil field observations, a purposive sampling approach could provide the <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> on the relationships. However, quantifying this <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{in the form of}} fuzzy membership functions for predictive soil mapping is a challenge. This paper presents a method to construct fuzzy membership functions using <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Construction of fuzzy membership functions is accomplished based on two types of knowledge: 1) knowledge on typical environmental conditions of each soil type and 2) knowledge on how each soil type corresponds to changes in environmental conditions. These two types of knowledge can be extracted from catenary sequences of soil types and the associated environment information collected at a few field samples through purposive sampling. The proposed method was tested in a watershed located in Heshan farm of Nenjiang County in Heilongjiang Province of China. A set of membership functions were constructed to represent the <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> on soil-landscape relationships, which were derived from 22 field samples collected through a purposive sampling approach. A soil subgroup map and an A-horizon soil organic matter content map for the area were generated using these membership functions. Forty five field validation points were collected independently to evaluate the two soil maps. The soil subgroup map achieved 76 % of accuracy. The A-horizon soil organic matter content map based on the derived fuzzy membership functions was compared with that derived from a multiple linear regression model. The comparison showed that the soil organic content map based on fuzzy membership functions performed better than the soil map based on the linear regression model. The proposed method could also be used to construction membership functions from <b>descriptive</b> <b>knowledge</b> obtained from other sources. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The BPS trade-off results from the interplay of two conflicting effects. On the one hand, BPS positively influences different dimensions of process performance, such as time, cost, and quality (Münstermann et al. 2010). On the other, BPS causes investments and may reduce an organization’s ability to meet customer needs (De Vries et al. 2006; Hammer and Stanton 1999). While BPS has been intensely studied from an information systems (IS), operations management, organizational design, and BPM perspective, the BPS trade-off {{is yet to be}} fully analyzed (Münstermann and Weitzel 2008; Venkatesh and Bala 2012).
