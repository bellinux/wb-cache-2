Today the doppio is the standard shot, and because solos require a different <b>filter</b> <b>basket,</b> solo shots are often produced by making ("pulling") a doppio in a two-spout portafilter, but only catching one of the streams (the other stream may be discarded or used in another drink).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to verify the {{possibility}} of the existence of preferential flow paths in a septic tank and the effect of using various types of inlet and outlet in this context. Two of the most unfavourable variants of favoured flow paths for different types of inlet and outlet were analysed. The first variant was related to the occurrence of the privileged flow path below the water surface level directly to the outlet and the second variant – to the so-called boiling phenomenon in a septic tank. During the study, the intensity of outflow from the septic tank was measured. The time between successive doses also was measured. These studies were carried out using several inlet and outlet structures combinations.  It was observed that by introducing a suitable outlet it is possible to limit and in the case of the particular type of <b>filtering</b> <b>basket</b> – to eliminate the unwanted phenomenon of preferential flow paths after hot water introduction. The phenomenon of boiling in the septic tank may occur due to the introduction of wastewater of higher density containing a higher concentration of the suspension. The effect of cooler water introduction on this phenomenon was not observed. The limitation of the maximum intensity of outflow from the septic tank can be achieved by <b>filtering</b> <b>basket</b> using at the outlet, which increases the flow resistance thanks to the low porosity...|$|R
5000|$|Cafés {{may have}} a {{standardized}} shot (size and length), such as [...] "triple ristretto", only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as lattes, but not changing the extraction - changing between a double and a triple requires changing the <b>filter</b> <b>basket</b> size, while changing between ristretto, normale, and lungo may require changing the grind, which is less easily accommodated in a busy café, as fine tweaking of the grind is a central aspect to consistent quality espresso-making.|$|E
50|$|As the caffè crema is very {{uncommon}} in the English-speaking world, and not widely available outside of home brewing, {{there are few}} English-language resources on how to brew it, nor consistency in what precisely is understood by this. What is generally done is to coarsen the grind, but otherwise extract {{in much the same}} way as espresso, stopping the shot when it blonds, as is usual for espresso - the coarser grind resulting in greater volume, but the extraction taking approximately the same time (25-30 seconds). Some variants include tamping less or extracting for slightly longer (35-40 seconds), and coarser grinds generally result in less mass of grinds fitting into a given <b>filter</b> <b>basket,</b> leading some to prefer using triple-shot baskets to allow sufficient coffee.|$|E
50|$|Moka brewing (invented 1933, Alfonso Bialetti) uses a bed {{of coffee}} grounds placed in a <b>filter</b> <b>basket</b> between a {{pressure}} chamber and receptacle. Vapor pressure above the water heated in the pressure chamber forces the water through the grounds, past the filter, and into the receptacle. The amount of vapor pressure that builds up, and the temperature reached, are dependent on the grind and packing ("tamping") of the grounds. This is distinct from percolator brewing in that pressure, rather than gravity, moves the water through the grounds; that the water is not recycled through the grounds; and that the water {{does not have to}} be boiled to reach the brew chamber. In the South of Europe, in countries like Italy or Spain, the domestic use of the moka expanded quickly and completely substituted the percolator by the end of the 1930s.|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} analysis of renal artery stent revascularization with distal embolic protection in a high-risk patient population with ischemic nephropathy is presented. A total of 63 patients (median age 70. 2 years, range 54 – 86 years) had significant atherosclerotic stenosis of 83 renal arteries documented on pre-procedural imaging. All patients had baseline {{chronic renal insufficiency}} with a documented deterioration in renal function in the 6 months before revascularization. The endovascular technique used in all patients involved primary passage of an embolic filter into the distal main renal artery followed by primary stent deployment with a balloon expandable stainless steel stent. The <b>filter</b> <b>baskets</b> were recaptured and contents submitted for pathological analysis. At 6 months post-intervention, 97 % of patients demonstrated stabilization or improvement in renal function. Only 3 % of patients had an inexorable decline in renal function, unchanged by the intervention. After a mean follow up of 16. 0 months (6 – 27), 94 % of patients demonstrated stabilization or improvement in renal function. One patient suffered an acute post-procedural deterioration in renal function. In total, 60 % of the <b>filter</b> <b>baskets</b> contained embolic material. This study confirms the technical feasibility of renal artery stent deployment with adjuvant embolic protection. The excellent results for renal preservation at 6 months post-intervention also suggest that a distal embolic protection device may improve the impact of percutaneous renal revascularization on progressive deterioration in renal function. The postulated mechanism is through the prevention of atheromatous embolization and the embolic yield from the distal filters supports this hypothesis. Patients most likely to receive the greatest benefit are those with mild baseline chronic renal insufficiency and a recent decline in renal function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{present a}} {{retrospective}} {{review of a}} single tertiary hospital experience in renal artery stent revascularization with distal protection in patients with ischemic nephropathy. The objectives of the study included preliminary assessment {{of the effect of}} distal protection on procedure-related acute deterioration in renal function and on renal salvage. Material and methodsAll patients had significant atherosclerotic main renal artery stenosis, documented at preprocedural imaging, and a degree of chronic renal impairment before revascularization. Forty-six renal arteries were treated in 37 patients with preprocedural renal impairment, which was mild in 10 patients, moderate in 19 patients, and severe in 8 patients. Median patient age was 72 years (range, 59 - 85 years). All patients underwent primary stenting of renal artery ostial stenoses with adjuvant use of a filter device (Angioguard guide wire system; Cordis Corp, Division of Johnson & Johnson, Miami, Fla) in the distal main renal artery. The <b>filter</b> <b>baskets</b> were recaptured for pathologic analysis. ResultsOverall, in 95 % of patients, including all patients with preprocedural mild or moderate renal impairment, renal function was stabilized or improved after revascularization. In 5 % of patients decline in renal function was unchanged. No patients had acute postprocedural deterioration. Mean follow-up was 12. 5 months (range, 2 - 28 months). These results are better than in most reports in the literature and also better than in a historical group of similar patients with ischemic nephropathy who underwent stent revascularization without distal protection at the same institution. The improved results are thought to be due to prevention of cholesterol atheroembolization during the procedure by the distal <b>filter</b> <b>baskets.</b> Sixty-five percent of the distal protection baskets contained embolic material, including fresh thrombus, chronic thrombus, atheromatous fragments, and cholesterol clefts. ConclusionA distal protection device may significantly improve results during stent revascularization. There are a number of unique demands on a renal protection device, and the ideal device has not yet been developed...|$|R

It {{is widely used}} in databases, networks, and distributed systems. This paper presents a novel Bloom <b>Filter,</b> called <b>Basket</b> Bloom <b>Filter</b> (BBF). The BBF deals with different elements in a data set depending on their query invalidation cost, by clustering elements into different baskets. The total query invalidation cost function is defined. In order to minimize the total query invalidation cost, the genetic algorithm is employed to find the optimal number of hash functions for every basket.

5000|$|Mysidacea {{are small}} {{crustaceans}} that live close to shore and hover above the sea floor, constantly collecting particles with their <b>filter</b> <b>basket.</b> They {{are an important}} food source for herring, cod, flounder, and striped bass. Mysids have a high resistance to toxins in polluted areas, and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators.Antarctic krill manages to directly utilize the minute phytoplankton cells, which no other higher animal of krill size can do. This is accomplished through filter feeding, using the krill's developed front legs, providing for a very efficient filtering apparatus: the six thoracopods form a very effective [...] "feeding basket" [...] used to collect phytoplankton from the open water. In the animation {{at the top of}} this page, the krill is hovering at a 55° angle on the spot. In lower food concentrations, the feeding basket is pushed through the water for over half a meter in an opened position, and then the algae are combed to the mouth opening with special setae on the inner side of the thoracopods.Porcelain crab species have feeding appendages covered with setae to filter food particles from the flowing water.Most species of barnacles are filter feeders, using their highly modified legs to sift plankton from the water.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} for producing fibrous mats with aligned micro- and nano-fibres by electrospinning technique using a fast rotating <b>filter</b> <b>basket</b> of a properly adapted commercial centrifugal juicer as the collecting electrode. This method was used to ob-tain the fibrous materials from polylactide (PLA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with dif-ferent degrees of fibres aligned depending on the linear velocity of the rotating substrate. The highest degree of the fibre alignment, measured by the planar orientation factor, with a value of 0. 8 - 0. 9, was obtained at the linear speeds of the rotating substrate {{in the range of}} 22 - 36 m/s. Using the gravimetric method, the velocity of fibre formation during elec-trospinning was tested under different conditions, i. e. at the immobile substrate as well as rapidly rotating, reaching values ranging from 4 to 200 m/s. The investigations suggest that electrospinning of the fibres on the rapidly rotating substrate is not only a modification of their receiving, but also significantly changes the nature of the fibre formation in this spin-ning technique.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} ways to mitigate stormwater pollution, but this {{study focused on}} the DrainPacTM catchment basin insert and the feasibility of integrating N-halamine biocidal brominated beads into the filter system. This study was divided into three sections. The first section involved testing a DrainPacTM filter for treatable flow rates, head loss, and removal of solids, oil, and bacteria. The DrainPacTM filter {{is designed to be}} installed in a stormwater catch basin. The filter is composed of a 12 x 41 inch metal frame with textile filter media attached to it in a basket shape. The upper portion of one panel of the <b>filter</b> <b>basket</b> is made from a plastic mesh to allow overflow if the filter is overloaded. The second section of this study involved testing N-halamine brominated biocidal beads in laboratory-scale columns, and the third section involved integrating the beads into the DrainPacTM filter and testing it full scale. For the DrainPacTM filter tests, the unit was installed into a custom-built test flume which was designed to mimic the conditions that would be encountered in a real stormwater application. The flume was supplied with a gravity-fed stream of water from a retention pond located on the Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo campus. The initial tests were conducted to determine the amount of head loss produced by the filter. First, the clean filter was subjected to flow rates between 20 and 200 GPM. The filter showed very minimal head loss (0. 5 to 9. 1 cm for 20 to 200 GPM) when not loaded with solids. Next, the filter was subjected to 200 GPM flow with a solids concentration of between 80 and 100 mg/L until it failed (overflowed). This occurred after 625 g of solids had been added to the filter. After the filter had been loaded with solids to the point of overflow at 200 GPM, it was tested to determine what flow rate could be filtered with the solids present. The fully loaded filter was able to pass a flow rate of up to 80 GPM before overflowing. The DrainPacTM filter removed solids at a range of efficiencies from 83 to 91 % at flow rates between 20 and 200 GPM. The higher removal efficiencies were achieved at the lower flow rates. The filter removed oil at efficiencies ranging between 40 and 80 %. The oil removal efficiency did not appear to depend on the flow rate. The DrainPacTM filter did not remove bacteria under the test conditions. Following the DrainPacTM experiments, 0. 3 mm and 0. 8 mm diameter N-halamine brominated biocidal beads were tested in the lab using a laboratory glass column. At flow rates between 0. 28 and 1. 4 mL/sec, a 1 cm bed height of the 0. 3 mm beads was found to produce head losses between 19 and 51. 7 cm. The 0. 8 mm beads produced head losses ranging from 11. 9 to 47. 7 cm when tested over the same range of flow rates. These flow rates represent nominal velocities between 0. 36 and 1. 8 cm/sec which would be expected in the DrainPacTM filter. The beads were then tested to determine how effectively they inactivate bacteria in a stream of water. Contact time after flowing through the column was found to be the key factor in how efficiently the beads worked. When the effluent samples were instantly quenched with sodium thiosulfate, the bacteria removal results matched those observed for the control (beads without bromine). When the samples were quenched directly after collection by adding the sodium thiosulfate to the sample as soon as the desired sample volume had been collected (95 to 285 seconds depending on flow rate), between 95 and over 99 percent of the bacteria were inactivated. After 10 minutes, all of the bacteria were inactivated. The final test involved integrating the N-halamine brominated beads into the DrainPacTM filter for a full scale test. Two sleeves containing 1400 grams of beads were laid into a DrainPacTM filter which was custom built to concentrate the flow through the beads. This system was tested using pond water with an average of 298 CFU/ 100 mL coliform bacteria at a flow rate of 36 GPM. The results of this test were very similar to the results of the lab scale testing. Contact time again proved to be necessary for bacteria inactivation. The filter with integrated N-halamine beads removed between 72 and 100 % of bacteria with contact time between 30 seconds and 10 minutes...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the incidence and clinical significance of embolic events in patients undergoing endovascular femoropopliteal interventions with or without embolic protection devices (EPDs). MethodsWe reviewed the clinical data of 566 patients treated by 836 endovascular femoropopliteal interventions for lower extremity claudication (46 %) or critical limb ischemia (54 %) from 2002 to 2012. Outcomes were analyzed in 74 patients/ 87 interventions performed with EPDs (Spider Rx; Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) and 513 patients/ 749 interventions performed without EPDs. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification, runoff scores, and embolic events were analyzed. End points were morbidity, mortality, reintervention, patency, and major amputation rates. ResultsBoth groups had similar demographics, indications, cardiovascular risk factors, and runoff scores, but patients treated with EPDs had significantly (P <. 05) longer lesions (109  ± 94  mm vs 85  ± 76  mm) and more often had occlusions (64 % vs 30 %) and TASC C/D lesions (56 % vs 30 %). Embolic events occurred in 35 of 836 interventions (4 %), including two (2 %) performed with EPD and 33 (4 %) without EPD (P =. 35). Macroscopic debris was noted in 59 (68 %) <b>filter</b> <b>baskets.</b> Embolic events were not associated with lesion length, TASC classification, runoff scores, treatment type, or indication but were independently associated with occlusion. Patients who had embolization required more reinterventions (20 % vs 3 %; P <. 001) and major amputations at 30  days (11 % vs 3 %; P =. 02). There was no difference in hospital stay (2. 4  ± 4  days vs 1. 6  ± 2  days; P =. 08), reintervention (2 % vs 4 %), and major amputation (1 % vs 4 %) among patients treated with or without EPD, respectively. The two patients who developed embolization with EPDs had no clinical sequela and required no reintervention. Most emboli were successfully treated by catheter aspiration or thrombolysis, but eight patients (24 %) treated without EPD required prolonged hospital stay, seven (21 %) had multiple reinterventions, one (3 %) had unanticipated major amputation, and one (3 %) died from hemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis. Median follow-up was 20  months. At 2  years, primary patency and freedom from reintervention was similar for TASC A/B and TASC C/D lesions treated with or without EPDs. ConclusionsRates of embolization are low in patients undergoing endovascular femoropopliteal interventions with (4 %) or without (2 %) EPD. Embolization is more frequent in patients with occlusions. While emboli in patients with EPD had no clinical sequel, those treated without EPD required multiple reinterventions in 21 % or resulted in major amputation or death in 3 %. Late outcomes were similar in patients treated with or without EPDs...|$|R
50|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} (RWH) is {{a practice}} of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the South East of England where there is less water available per person than in many Mediterranean countries. Rainwater harvesting in the UK is both a traditional and reviving technique for collecting water for domestic uses. This water is generally used for non-hygienic purposes like watering gardens, flushing toilets, and washing clothes. There is a growing demand for larger tank systems collecting between 1000-7500 litres of water. The two main uses for harvested rainwater are botanical uses, like gardening for plant irrigation, and domestic uses, like flushing toilets and running washing machines. Rainwater is almost always collected strictly from the roof, then heavily filtered using either a filter attached to the down pipe, a fine <b>basket</b> <b>filter</b> or for more expensive systems like self-cleaning filters placed in an underground tank. UK homes using some form of rainwater harvesting system can reduce their mains water usage by 50% or more, although a 20-30% saving is more common.|$|R
40|$|Luffa (Luffa aegyptica Mill syn. L. cylindrica), or Loofah or {{vegetable}} sponge, {{is a member}} of the Cucurbitaceae family. Luffa is closely related to and has similar cultural requirements as the cucumber. It is an annual climbing vine, which produces a fruit containing a fibrous vascular system. When separated from the skin, flesh and seeds, the fiber network can be used as a bathroom sponge. Luffa can also be used as packing material, for making crafts, and as filters. Used as a bath sponge it produces a mild glow on the skin. The blood circulation the sponge induces on the skin has been credited as a relief for rheumatic and arthritic sufferers. The versatility of the luffa goes beyond producing sponges. The young fruit, when small, (around 6 inches) are delicious used in soup or stew. They can also be cooked like summer squash. Older fruit have been reported to develop purgative chemicals. Because luffa has a compact network of close fibers, its resiliency makes it useful for many products like <b>filters,</b> slipper soles, <b>baskets.</b> Small pieces of luffa sponge are good for scraping vegetables like carrots without having to remove the valuable nutrients by peeling them. You can also wash dishes, scrub your tub, etc. with luffa. When they become soiled throw them in the washer! Luffa is environmentally safe, biodegradable and a renewable resource. Growing: Luffa requires a very long growing season in order to mature into dried sponges. Luffa is cold sensitive. Th...|$|R
