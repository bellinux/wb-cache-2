5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' {{probably only}} just scraping the £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, {{because this was}} Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second {{of whom had been}} Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett.

50|$|In 628 AD, Khusrau II and {{eighteen}} of {{his sons}} were assassinated {{by one of his}} own sons Kavadh II, who became the successor. After only a few months, he was also killed and a period of civil war broke out. Kavad's son Ardashir, then took the throne at a very young age. Ardashir was murdered by General Sarwaraz. Sarwaraz was the first king to take the throne that was not from the royal family. He was then murdered. This vacancy on the throne was then filled by Husrav's first daughter, Boran (Borandukht). No other woman, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> had ascended the Sasanian throne before. Boran and her sister were considered to be the only two legitimate heirs left of the royal family.When Boran came to power the power of the central authority was very weak due to civil wars. It was Borans' goal to once again bring stability to the empire as her father once had. To accomplish this, Boran offered a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. This would revitalize the empire through the implementation of justice, reconstruction of the infrastructure, lowering of taxes, and the minting of coins.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, the mayor's {{successor}} is {{not considered}} to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> much <b>in</b> the manner that the Vice President of the United States is not styled or considered to be Acting President following the death or resignation of the President, but rather President in every sense.|$|R

5|$|Ambrose Dudley was {{the fourth}} son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudleys had 13 {{children}} in all and were known for their Protestant leanings {{as well as for}} their happy family life. Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson. In August 1549 Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett. Back in London, Dudley was knighted and married Anne Whorwood, daughter of William Whorwood, deceased Attorney-General. In 1552 they had a daughter who died soon.

5|$|Makeba's {{daughter}} Bongi, who was {{a singer}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> and had often accompanied her mother on stage, died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two grandchildren, and decided {{to move out of}} Guinea. She settled in the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert district of the Belgian capital Brussels. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to Paul Simon, and a few months later she embarked on Simon's very successful Graceland Tour. The tour concluded with two concerts held in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as Graceland: The African Concert. After touring the world with Simon, Warner Bros. Records signed Makeba and she released Sangoma ("Healer"), an album of healing chants named in honour of her sangoma mother. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: Graceland had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba's participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed).|$|E
6000|$|It {{might be}} {{that the young man}} was a ravenous wolf, but his manners were not wolfish. Had Mrs. O'Hara been a princess, supreme <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> young Neville could not have treated her or her {{daughter}} with more respect. At first Kate had wondered at him, but had said but little. She had listened to him, as he talked to her mother and the priest about the cliffs and the birds and the seals he had shot, and she had felt that it was this, something like this, that was needed to make life so sweet that as yet there need be no longing, no thought, for eternity. It was not that all at once she loved him, but she felt that he was a thing to love. His very appearance on the cliff, and the power of thinking of him when he was gone, for a while banished all tedium from her life. [...] "Why should you shoot the poor gulls?" [...] That was the first question she asked him; and she asked it hardly in tenderness to the birds, but because with the unconscious cunning of her sex she understood that tenderness in a woman is a charm in the eyes of a man.|$|R
50|$|The Four Monarchs once {{ruled the}} world until a {{critical}} shift engineered by the Ascended removed them from power.

5000|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} first season a C− rating, writing that the series wastes the talents of its cast members. Tim Dowling of The Guardian writes, [...] "Each {{character}} may be unpleasant <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> but the sheer charmlessness of the group is hard to overstate. If they were {{sitting at a table}} near you, you’d leave the restaurant." ...|$|R
5|$|The current Raglan Castle {{was begun}} by Sir William ap Thomas, the lesser {{son of a}} minor Welsh family who rose {{through the ranks of}} mid-15th century politics, {{profiting}} from the benefits of the local offices he held. William married first Elizabeth, a wealthy heiress, and then Gwladus ap Thomas, another heiress who would prove to be a powerful regional figure <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b> In 1432 William purchased the manor of Raglan, where he had already been staying as a tenant, for 1,000 marks (£666) and commenced a programme of building work that established the basic shape of the castle as seen today, although most of it— {{with the exception of the}} South Gate and the Great Tower— was later built over.|$|E
5|$|The first {{king of the}} new dynasty was Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who {{was known}} as Władysław II Jagiełło in Poland. He was elected king of Poland in 1386 after his {{marriage}} to Jadwiga of Anjou, the Queen of Poland <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The Christianization of Lithuania in the Latin Rite followed. Jogaila's rivalry in Lithuania with his cousin Vytautas the Great, who was opposed to Lithuania's domination by Poland, was settled in 1392 in the Ostrów Agreement and in 1401 in the Union of Vilnius and Radom: Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life under Jogaila's nominal supremacy. The agreement made possible a close cooperation {{between the two nations}} necessary to succeed in struggles with the Teutonic Order. The Union of Horodło of 1413 defined the relationship further and granted privileges to the Roman Catholic (as opposed to Eastern Orthodox) segment of the Lithuanian nobility.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's sister, and {{therefore}} Edward IV's niece, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, {{the cause was}} more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, Clarence, was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to Sir Richard Pole, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, {{the only woman in}} 16th-century England to hold a peerage title <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Maryland Lieutenant Governor, {{currently}} Boyd Rutherford, {{is therefore}} weaker than {{the office in}} most other states which have one (several states do not have one). For instance, in many states, including Texas, the Lieutenant Governor is the President of the State's Senate and in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes all of the Governor's powers {{when he or she}} is out of the state. In both of those states, as in some others, the Lieutenant Governor is elected <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> independently of the state's Governor.|$|R
