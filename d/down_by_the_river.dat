People want them. I had to apologise for playing something new". The group had toured both nationally and internationally – they became popular in Canada and parts of United States. Fellow Australian musician, Paul Kelly, described touring with Thomas' group [...] "e did a lot of shows with The Weddos ... and had all-night singalongs with them ... and at afternoon barbecues in lead singer Mick's big backyard <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> ... We liked a drink and weren't shy about it, but The Weddos made us look like ladies at a tea party". He noted that Thomas' musical influences were The Pogues, Fairport Convention, Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson.|$|E

60|$|Dr. Carpenter has {{discussed}} {{the significance of}} this remarkable fact, and he is disposed to attribute the absence of life at great depths, partly to the absence of any circulation of the water of the Mediterranean at such depths, and partly to the exhaustion of the oxygen of <b>the</b> water <b>by</b> <b>the</b> organic matter contained in the fine clay, which he conceives to be formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> finest particles of <b>the</b> mud brought <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> which flow into the Mediterranean.|$|R

60|$|There he mounts a high {{tower in}} his mind and looks out far and wide. Many solitary figures he {{perceives}} creeping through the streets; many solitary figures out on heaths, and roads, and lying under haystacks. But the figure that he seeks is not among them. Other solitaries he perceives, in nooks of bridges, looking over; and in shadowed places <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> level; and a dark, dark, shapeless object drifting with the tide, more solitary than all, clings with a drowning hold on his attention.|$|R

Another small settlement on the west bank, South Stoke is about 0.5 mi to the south east and can be reached by a footpath and a footbridge over <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> A suspension bridge on the path was rebuilt by British Army Gurkhas in 2009 after being damaged by a falling tree.|$|R
50|$|Each {{natural region}} of the Aude has its own {{particular}} landscape. In the east, lagoons or coastal lakes form a barrier between land and sea.

This environment is demanding for flora and fauna, as it suffers from the rigours of sea, sun, dryness and floods. Halophile (i.e., salt-loving) plants grow there {{and it is also}} noted for animals such as the pink flamingo and white stilt.|$|R

25|$|The {{alluvium}} {{which is}} found in the Indo-Gangetic plain belongs to this era. It was eroded from <b>the</b> Himalayas <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and <b>the</b> monsoons. These alluvial deposits consist of clay, loam, silt etc. and are divided into the older alluvium and the newer alluvium. The older alluvium is called Bhangar and is present in the ground above the flood level of <b>the</b> <b>rivers.</b> Khaddar or newer alluvium is confined to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> channels and their flood plains. This region has some of the most fertile soil found in the country as new silt is continually laid <b>down</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> every year.|$|R
