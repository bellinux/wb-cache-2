25|$|The obvious {{solution}} was to switch the Zeppelins' lifting gas from highly flammable hydrogen to inert helium. However, helium was only produced in the United States, was extremely expensive and had been embargoed since 1927. American airships equipped with helium were also forced to conserve it at all costs, which hampered their operational characteristics. Finally, a delay by the DZR to apply for an <b>import</b> <b>license</b> during a politically favorable moment in 1938 meant that it was deprived of the gas when relations between the US and Nazi Germany deteriorated soon after. In any event, helium's high cost would probably have made future operations of the huge zeppelins unprofitable, particularly in competition with the new flying boats.|$|E
2500|$|Bayer {{officials}} (responding {{on behalf}} of Cutter) issued a statement, stating that Cutter continued to sell the old medicine, [...] "because some customers doubted the new drug's effectiveness", and because some countries were slow to approve its sale. The company also said that a shortage of plasma, {{used to make the}} medicine, had kept Cutter from manufacturing more of the new product." [...] Bayer officials also claimed that an overall plasma shortage in 1985 kept Cutter from making more heat treated medicine; however, because Cutter was using some of its limited plasma to continue making the old product, they {{may have contributed to the}} shortage. [...] While Bayer said that [...] "procedural requirements" [...] imposed by Taiwan slowed down their ability to sell the new product, according to The New York Times, Hsu Chien-wen, an official at Taiwan's health department, said in 2003 that Cutter had not applied for permission to sell the heated medicine until July 1985, a year and a half after doing so in the United States. Cindy Lai, assistant director of Hong Kong's health department, said that Cutter needed only to get an <b>import</b> <b>license</b> in the 1980s to sell the newer product in which [...] "It normally [...] one week." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} account of how the <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> system in Kenya has {{developed}} {{up to and including}} the introduction of foreign exchange allocation licensing in December, 1972. This means by which different categories of imports are treated by the authorities are outlined and the theoretical implications of import restrictions discussed. It is postulated that <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> is the major means of protecting local manufacturers in Kenya. So the appendix tables indicate the <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> system has evolved to cover a large proportion of imparts entering Kenya.

5000|$|Import quotas: To {{reduce the}} {{quantity}} and therefore increase the market price of imported goods. The economic effects of an import quota {{is similar to that}} of a tariff, except that the tax revenue gain from a tariff will instead be distributed to those who receive <b>import</b> <b>licenses.</b> Economists often suggest that <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> be auctioned to the highest bidder, or that import quotas be replaced by an equivalent tariff.|$|R
50|$|An <b>import</b> <b>license</b> is a {{document}} issued {{by a national}} government authorizing the importation of certain goods into its territory.

40|$|Analyses of {{import quota}} regimes {{typically}} ignore institutional features {{under which the}} quota licenses are administered. However, distributing the bulk of <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> to {{a small number of}} firms can create oligopsony power and hence affect the level of quota rent and the potential success of auctioning licenses.

5000|$|Another {{disturbing}} trend {{had also}} been gaining steam in Nigeria since the early 1970s: a steep drop in agricultural production correlating roughly with the rise in federal revenues from petroleum extraction. Whereas previously Nigeria had been the world's lead exporter of cocoa, production of this cash crop dropped by 43%, while productivity in other important income generators like rubber (29%), groundnuts (64%), and cotton (65%) plummeted as well between 1972 and 1983. The decline in agricultural production {{was not limited to}} cash crops amid the oil boom, and national output of staple foodstuffs also fell. This situation contrasts to Nigeria in 1960 just after independence, when despite British underdevelopment, the nation was more or less self-sufficient in terms of food supply, while crops made up 97% of all revenue from exports. The drop in production was so substantial that by the early 1980s the NPN government was forced to implement a now notorious <b>import</b> <b>license</b> scheme which essentially involved Nigeria, {{for the first time in}} its history, importing basic food items. However, as Nigerian activist and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka asserts, [...] "the <b>import</b> <b>license</b> scam that was used by the party as a reward and enticement for party loyalists and would-be supporters cost the nation billions of dollars...while food production in the country virtually ceased".|$|E
50|$|Japan and South Korea {{continued}} to be the major markets till the year of 1994. Then it made a foray into European market with the exports of one lakh tonnes of iron ore to Slovakia and Romania. Also in the same year, the company had commenced import of gold and silver against special <b>import</b> <b>license</b> for supply to the customers in the domestic area. Imports worth 20 metric tonnes of gold and silver worth 270 tonnes was made and the company opened new gold vaults at Hyderabad and Vizag to offer its services to the customers in these areas. However, manganese ore exports remained depressed due to recession in the steel industry.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{discussions on}} U. S. trade {{policies}} suggest that import quotas should be auctioned {{to ensure the}} U. S. Treasury acquires the quota rent. However, studies estimating the potential benefits have ignored important details of import quota regimes and have assumed perfect competition and no exporter retaliation. We explore these three issues with an application to the U. S. cheese import quota regime. We show that when features of the U. S. dairy quota regime {{and structure of the}} cheese processing sector are accounted for, likely quota rents and potential welfare consequences of selling <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> change significantly. While quota license sales may raise Treasury receipts, they may also cause a net welfare loss. Key words: imperfect competition, <b>import</b> quotas, <b>licenses,</b> quota rents, U. S. cheese imports. Recent discussions on U. S. trade policies sug-gest that <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> could be sold to ensure that the U. S.

50|$|Many {{intermediaries}} {{exist to}} assure product quality or to hold stocks until needed by retailers who often have limited storage and retail space; they also help smaller retailers avoid issues like customs bonding {{and the need}} to secure an <b>import</b> <b>license.</b> The distributor sells large quantities of clothing stocks to a reseller, who tries to charge sufficient mark-ups to cover his costs and still make a profit. Often the supply chain will include more than one intermediary, although retailers usually strive for the fewest middlemen and lowest prices. Since the emergence of the Internet, many retailers have begun using it for just this purpose, and many new online-only wholesalers have emerged as a result. Nowadays, many websites offer this opportunity.|$|E
50|$|The {{only source}} for these {{crystals}} was the NZPO (New Zealand Post Office), and delivery times were often measured in months, {{which was an}} ongoing problem for Robinson {{in his ability to}} supply his radios. Warren Robinson realising there was an opportunity to compete with the NZPO sold Marlin Electronics to Autocrat Radio and went on to found Rakon Industries (RIL) a few years later (1967). Initially, the New Zealand government blocked Robinson's application to import crystal manufacturing equipment as they didn't wish there to be undue competition to the post office, however by 1967 Robinson was able to secure an <b>import</b> <b>license</b> for the equipment and started manufacturing quartz crystals, in his garage, to supply the local radio market.|$|E

50|$|In 1947, the FBI became {{interested}} in the operation and the Royal Canadians filed to extradite Levine, as the plant was in Canada was under his name. As a result, Levine was persona non grata in Canada and wasn’t permitted to enter Canada for at least 10 years. At that point, some of the machine components had been sent to Levine’s plastics warehouse in the Bronx. From there, Slavin and Levine bought boilers, took the tubes out and filled them with all of the tools, jigs and fixtures so that it appeared that they were shipping over boilers. They had a proper export license and were connected to a factory in Palestine that had the <b>import</b> <b>license,</b> and they clandestinely shipped the boilers. The boilers got through to Palestine and were placed in underground plants. Workers in the machine shops began working on the tools, jigs and fixtures and then began to buy machinery and producing weapons.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 Argentina {{sent their}} emissary, Brigadier General Juan Ignacio San Martín, to the US to {{convince}} an auto manufacturer to build cars in Argentina. In 1954 Kaiser {{was the only}} one to accept the offer, with the remainder believing the market was too small to justify the investment. Also, they did not have the rugged products Kaiser did. On January 19, 1955 Kaiser and the government of Argentina signed an agreement to permit Kaiser to manufacture automobiles and trucks in Argentina. In February, Kaiser created a wholly owned subsidiary named Kaiser Automotores, the holding company which in turn owned part of the newly created Industrias Kaiser Argentina S.A. (IKA), the manufacturing and marketing arm. Other partners in IKA included the government-owned vehicle manufacturer Industrias Aeronáuticas y Mecánicas del Estado (IAME) and private investors. In August Kaiser applied for and received an <b>import</b> <b>license</b> to bring in 1,021 completed cars, manufacturing equipment and spare parts from the US.
