40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question whether justice evaluations of income inequality in a society are determined more by country differences or by the social position an observer occupies. In very general terms what we study is whether, in shaping justice beliefs, cultural factors are more important than social-structural ones, or vice versa. In view of transformation societies, country differences are conflated with differences in the transformation processes the countries are experiencing. This is why we distinguish different types of transmations with regard to the postcommunist countries of Eastern and Central Europe testing empirically whether these transformation types exert influence on the justice beliefs, and how this influence compares to that of positional effects.

40|$|Though {{the concept}} of social justice is widely used in the social sciences, we know little {{about the amount of}} income {{inequality}} that is perceived as just and why perceptions vary across social contexts. In this paper, we argue the ways people define the causes of poverty are related to how they perceive and justify existing income inequality. We examine internal and external attributions of poverty using survey data from the 2006 <b>International</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Justice</b> Project (ISJP). We compare two culturally and structurally distinct regions—East and West Ger-many. The results support our hypothesis that the amount of income inequality people per-ceive as just is related to how they explain the causes of poverty, that is, internal and/or exter-nal attributions. Poverty attributions are crucial mediators and explain contextual differences in the perceived justice of income inequality between East and West Germany.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyzes Americans ’ {{views on}} distributive justice and asks whether {{and to what}} extent Americans support meritocratic ideals. The project finds that Americans are ambivalent in their views towards meritocracy. They believe that intelligence and hard work should be rewarded, but they also support inherited wealth, seniority pay, and the distribution of educational opportunities through the market. This project contributes much to the existing literature on public opinion and meritocracy because it finds that Americans are not as meritocratic as other studies have found. For example, Lipset and others have found that Americans support meritocratic ideals. It has also been shown that Americans believe that the US is a meritocratic society where intelligence and hard work is actually rewarded. Data from the <b>International</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Justice</b> Project, General Social Survey, World Values Survey and many public opinion polls are used in this project and confirm the previous findings. However, the data also show that Americans are ambivalent {{when it comes to their}} support of meritocratic ideals. Americans support the distribution of wealth b...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine married women’s perceptions of the division of household labor. Distributive justice theory has suggested the mechanisms through which individuals determine their situations are fair. However, the majority of applications of the distributive justice theory have been focused on Western nations. This research extends these previous applications in two ways. First, the self-evaluation theory is integrated with distributive justice theory and elaborated into a new theory, called Contextual Distributive Justice Theory. Second, part of this new theory is tested using a sample of 4581 married women from the <b>International</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Justice</b> Project data. Using multi-level analysis, this research suggests that context does matter in predicting married women’s perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor. There are statistically significant differences in women’s average perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor based upon their nation of residence. Context indirectly affects women’s perceptions of fairness through national ideology and women’s overall empowerment. Further, women’s individual measures of empowerment affect their perceptions of fairness differently based upon the overall empowerment of women i...|$|E
40|$|While {{respect for}} nature pervades {{contemporary}} thought, issues of environmentalism and alternative energy largely lack {{a place in}} modern global conceptions of social justice. A theoretical or philosophical defense of these issues is therefore necessary to reinforce intuitions about nature, and ground them upon some substantive justification. One can find this justification in the Rawlsian theory of justice, which already informs many modern liberal notions. Rawlsian justice relies upon the Kantian notion that humans are autonomous beings— beings that are “ends” in themselves (that have inherent value). Rawls’ theory of justice attempts to respect each of these “ends. ” However, traditional Rawlsian theory only considers persons today {{in its attempt to}} formulate social justice. By expanding the scope of what one considers to be an “end” to include both aspects of nature as well as persons in the future, one can transform the implications of Rawls’ theory. If these new “ends” are incorporated into the Rawlsian schema, they will gain all the argumentative potency of the influential theory. This expansion of Rawlsian justice will give much needed theoretical support to the issues of environmentalism and alternative energy, assimilating them into conceptions of <b>international</b> <b>social</b> <b>justice...</b>|$|E
