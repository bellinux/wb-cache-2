5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as they are often seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. While that was originally <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prerequisite to a failed 1980 Alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to Alaskan citizens for pipeline-related revenue, it also {{turned out to be}} significant in the development of binary economics.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{is divided}} into six parts, forty-three {{sections}} and four schedules, and focuses upon five specific areas of law. These are the duty of care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive remuneration for work <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trustee.|$|E

50|$|The cost of vertebroplasty in Europe as of 2010 was ~2,500 Euro. As of 2010 in the United States, when <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outpatient, vertebroplasty costs around 3300 USD while kyphoplasty costs around 8100 USD {{and when}} <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{inpatient}} vertebroplasty cost ~11,000 USD and kyphoplasty 16,000 USD.|$|R
50|$|Do-support is {{not used}} when there is already an {{auxiliary}} or copular verb present or with non-finite verb forms (infinitives and participles). It is sometimes used with subjunctive forms. Furthermore, the use of <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auxiliary should be distinguished {{from the use of}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normal lexical verb, <b>as</b> in They <b>do</b> their homework.|$|R
5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current alignment during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The designation was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spur to the alignment of PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire alignment of PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, the alignment has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with the designation of Interstate 84, the alignment of PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual {{as it was}} the Australian Labor Party's policy not to award knighthoods, but was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to the British government's awards to British and American officers for the North African campaign. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Sellers's {{career on}} radio, film, {{television}} and record spanned from 1948 until his death. He made his radio debut on ShowTime in 1948, followed by appearances in Ray's a Laugh, Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To Be Young. Along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, he {{took part in}} the radio series The Goon Show (1951–60). Throughout his career, Sellers made a number of television appearances, in character roles and for interviews and advertisements. His stage appearances were few, largely because he had been unhappy with the touring he had <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child with his family. During his career he also released a number of albums containing sketches and comic songs; the songs were undertaken in a variety of comic characters.|$|E
5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive {{remuneration}} for work <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trustee. It sets a new duty of care, both objective and standard, massively extends the trustees' power of investment and limits the trustees' liability for the actions of agents, also providing for their remuneration for work done {{in the course of the}} trust.|$|E
5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808. In Barker's {{letter to}} Dunlop, he writes the {{performance}} was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> benefit for Mr. Bray (who also {{played the role}} of Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, {{it is clear that the}} performance was interrupted by an offstage commotion which may have cut the performance short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who {{played the role of}} Larry, was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E

5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became {{the head of the}} family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precautionary measure, so that {{in the event of a}} default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.|$|E

He always reached out to kids to get involve in BMX to possibly keep them from falling into the same type of trouble he <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young boy, being involved in petty crimes including shoplifting and stealing bicycles. As noted, he credits BMX for saving him from a life of crime.|$|R
