40|$|Introduction. Cerebral {{infarction}} is {{more and}} more frequently present by massive participation and high percentage of mortality even in young population. It is notified as very hard, vitally endangered disease. Objective. To prove whether there is a difference in the gas analyses of the arterial and cerebral venous blood between the patients with the cerebral infarction of the left and right hemisphere and why it is significant for the treatment of those patients. Material and methods. Sixty-five (65) patients of both sexes who were diagnosed by CT as: cerebral infarction, cerebral multiinfarctions and cerebral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions</b> were investigated. Under the same conditions their radial artery and left and right internal jugular vein were tapped - on the fourth, eighth and tenth day of their disease. Gas analysis, calculation of oxygen content and statistical comparison of testing results were performed from the samples of arterial and venous blood. Results. By continuous monitoring of gas analysis parameters of arterial and cerebral venous blood from internal jugular vein, we can follow up the phases of disease, the velocity of changes of gas analysis parameters and adequacy of brain circulation and to correct therapy adequately for the purpose of preventing basic disease complications and to estimate the results of treatment.

40|$|IN 1947 {{a new era}} of surgery, {{functional}} neurosurgery, {{was initiated}} by Spiegel and Wycis. Since that time stereotaxic lesions of certain subcortical structures in man have been produced in several neurosurgical centres by different techniques (Talairach, Leksell, Riechert, Narabayashi, Guiot et ah). In various diseases this method is superior to open surgical intervention. Its main indication is the treatment of extrapyramidal motor disturbances. From 1950 until the end of 1958 we carried out 560 operations by means of our target apparatus, 329 of them in extrapyramidal motor disturbances. Out of these 560 cases 10 were fatal, i. e. 1 - 79 per cent, of the 329 cases with extrapyramidal motor disturbances 7, i. e. 2 - 12 per cent. 5 of these patients died due to an intra- or post-operative intracerebral haemorrhage, one of a massive lung embolism, one of multiple <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions</b> of the cortex, probably secondary to penicillin therapy. We intend to report our physiological and pathophysiological observa-tions during stimulation and during or after high frequency-coagulation. At the same time we shall discuss the indications for the treatment and why we prefer to eliminate certain subcortical structures in extra-pyramidal motor disturbances.

This case report aims to remind the internist and neurologist {{to bear in mind}} unusual aetiologies of brain infarcts in patients without classical cardiovascular risk factors. Case Description: A 49 -year-old male with pulmonary asthma and a prior history of nasal polyps had a wake-up stroke with left-sided symptoms and speech disturbance. A head MRI and MR angiography revealed a recent haemorrhagic infarct in the right putamen and corona radiata. The left hemiparesis progressed to sensory-motor hemiplegia on the 4 th day. In the head CT, it was shown that the haemorrhagic infarct had progressed to a large haematoma. A pansinusitis was also diagnosed. The aetiological investigations revealed a minor atrial septal defect (ASD) with shunting and a heterozygotic clotting factor V R 506 Q mutation. A remarkable blood eosinophilia of 9. 80 E 9 /l (42 %) together with fever, sinusitis, wide-spread bilateral nodular pulmonary infiltrates that did not respond to wide-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, positive anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, a high myeloperoxidase antibody level and slightly positive anti-proteinase 3 antibodies suggested the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. These inflammatory symptoms and findings promptly responded to treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} hospital clinic-based study {{estimated that}} 3. 5 % of minor strokes {{are due to}} primary intracerebral haemorrhage, but the confidence intervals were wide. Moreover this figure may be an underestimate in older patients, who {{are less likely to}} be referred to secondary care, and who may have higher rates of intracerebral haemorrhage. Further studies are required to validate and increase the precision of this estimate and to determine any association with age, in order to plan appropriate services for minor stroke. METHOD: We determined the frequency of intracerebral haemorrhage and <b>haemorrhagic</b> transformation of <b>infarction</b> in consecutive patients presenting with minor stroke (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale or= 85 years (0 - 3 %). We identified only one previous study with a reliable estimate of the proportion of minor stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage, and in a pooled analysis including 842 patients, the overall frequency of intracerebral haemorrhage was 4. 8 % (4. 5 - 5. 0 %). CONCLUSION: We have shown that the proportion of minor stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage was very similar in a population-based cohort and a hospital clinic-based cohort using different imaging strategies, and that the frequency is independent of age.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the intra-arterial administration of streptokinase within 24 hours of acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: Patients who presented to the Austin Hospital casualty department between 3 and 22 hours after an acute stroke were considered for the study. Eligible patients had pretreatment non-contrast computed tomographic scans of the brain to exclude haemorrhage. Streptokinase (250, 000 units) was administered directly into the common carotid artery or the cervical portion of the internal carotid artery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral haemorrhage, <b>haemorrhagic</b> transformation of <b>infarction,</b> angiographic reperfusion, clinical outcome at seven to 10 days {{and the frequency of}} other complications. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated over a 16 -month period. Major clinical improvement occurred in five patients (39 %) at 48 hours. This was associated with angiographically demonstrated recanalisation of a middle cerebral artery occlusion in two patients and partial recanalisation in two others. Significant hypotension in two patients required therapy to be stopped. In five other cases mild hypotension developed but the streptokinase infusion was completed. Haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct occurred in four patients without clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial administration of streptokinase is safe in selected patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The theoretical benefit of an increased local thrombolytic effect and reduced systemic complications, compared with the use of higher intravenous doses, justifies a randomised clinical trial. If therapies such as this are to be successful, rapid referral to an appropriate centre is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The purpura {{accompanying}} the two foregoing cases of sarcoimatosis {{would seem to}} find its explanation in the coexistence of several factors, the main feature being an involvement of the vascular system by the sarcomatous elements. There existed in Case I a direct lesion of the vessel wall whereby the sarcoma cells invaded directly the various coats, and were found mainly between the intima and the adventitia, dissecting their way, as it were, along these tracts in the vessel walls. There was further an extensive involvement of the perivascular lymphatics, from which point, indeed, {{it would seem that}} the sarcoma cells had invaded the walls of the vessels themselves. In Case II, moreover, not only was there a definite invasion of the lymph spaces near the vessels, but, furthermore, there was undoubted evidence of the existence of emboli of sarcoma cells in the lumina of the blood vessels; and in the immediate vicinity of such conditions hæmorrhages were invariably found. While some vessels, and indeed a great many, were quite free from such emboli, in others the lumina were completely occluded by spindle cells, so as to preclude the possibility that these were merely a collection of desquamated endothelial cells, such as is frequently found as the result of post-mortem changes. That such an embolic condition can exist is by no means an unreasonable supposition, and, while it is generally recognised that multiple sarcomata are usually made up of small round cells, in this case we have an undoubted example of sarcomatosis of the spindle-celled variety. There are numerous instances of this " embolic purpura," as it may be called, especially in French and German literature, the condition being associated with rheumatism, valvular lesions of the heart, and other diseases which induce directly or indirectly the formation of emboli. Krauss, Gimard, Leloir, and others have insisted with considerable emphasis on the embolic origin of many purpuric conditions, and in some instances they have verified their observations by histological examination. Leloir assumes that, in addition to the presence of the ordinary emboli and the changes in the vessel walls with desquamative endarteritis, the blood itself may be much altered chemically, and that in the cachectic conditions clots may be thrown down from the circulating blood and be carried onward to form capillary emboli, with resulting <b>hæmorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions.</b> Krogerer, some ten years ago, in examining the skin removed from patients with symptomatic purpura, found definite thromboses in the smaller veins, and even in the arteries. According to his view, the alterations in the vessel walls gave rise to slowed circulation and tendency to thrombosis, bringing about a liability to hæmorrhages. His plates bear out his theories regarding the thrombi, many of which show considerable organization. But a careful examination of the purpuric areas shows further that a mere invasion of the vascular system by sarcoma cells can not explain all the various blood effusions present. On examining the skin, for instance, in those areas where large irregular hæmorrhages had occurred, there was but little evidence of vascular invasion, while the emboli, on the other hand, seemed to exist mainly in the localized smaller and more circumscribed patches. One must therefore conclude that in such instances a combination of factors will alone afford a rational explanation of the purpura, and that in the general condition of the patient we shall find another cause for the enormous effusions of blood. In both of our cases there were high fever, cachexia, and a rapid progressive asthenia, all being the results of a sarcomatosis, and implying also grave alterations in the composition of the blood. From this we may infer an altered condition of the vessel walls, and hence probably a combination of circumstances sufficient to explain the incidence of hæmorrhage. The raised cutaneous nodules in our second case, some of which were hæmorrhagic, can not be regarded as pure sarcomatous metastases, for on microscopic examination they merely revealed hæmorrhage or necrosis, or both, and sometimes plugging of the vessels. There was nowhere in these nodules evidence of new growths. Such elevations, then, must have been produced rather by a temporary serous or cellular exudation coincident with or following upon the hæmorrhage—a probability which is emphasized by the fact that during the last days of the patient's illness many of the nodules diminished in size. Whether the œdema and infiltration were secondary to the embolic process in the subcutaneous vessels or whether they were merely coincident with the hæmorrhage would be difficult to decide. The ringlike spots, however, are of special interest, inasmuch as it has been shown that they have been present in more than one case of sarcoma. It is not impossible that such spots may be definitely related either to the embolic processes or to a direct invasion of the cutaneous vessels, though, so far as we know, there do not exist any experimental proofs to bear out such a theory. From what has been said, however, it is evident that the cutaneous vessels were plugged during the last few days of the illness, at a time when the walls of the smaller vessels and capillaries were already greatly enfeebled. The result of the embolic formation may therefore mean a decided deficiency in the supply of nutriment to the involved area, the collateral circulation naturally being poor under the circumstances. As soon, then, as the vessels had become plugged, the surrounding blood supply would be poured in to a limited extent, and, on meeting the enfeebled vessels, might possibly break through their thin walls, thus producing a zone of hæmorrhage around the area deprived of its normal nutrition. In other words, the condition may be regarded as in many respects analogous to that presented in embolic infarcts in regions with end arteries, central necrosis with peripheral congestion and hæmorrhage being induced, the latter being chiefly limited to the outer zone of the necrotic area. The cutaneous vessels under such circumstances may be regarded as end arteries in a functional sense, since the collateral circulation would be so diminished under the altered conditions that no complete nourishment could be afforded to the area supplied normally by the plugged vessel. Von Recklinghausen has directed especial attention to the occurrence of cutaneous hæmorrhages following embolic or thrombotic occlusion of peripheral arteries. The possibility of some toxic condition as a factor in the production of the purpura in our cases may also be suggested; but while we would not exclude this possibility, we are unable to find any positive evidence in its favour. Focal necroses, which are often associated with toxic and infectious processes, were present only in direct association with the hæmorrhages, and were not distributed in the liver, spleen, and kidneys in the manner characteristic of toxic infections. Nevertheless the absence of these necroses does not exclude the possibility of the existence of some form of toxæmia. Infection demonstrable by bacteriological examination was absent, and there is no reason to regard our cases as allied to the infectious purpuras. The thermic theory suggested by Fagge at all events finds no place in the production of the multiple tumours in our cases, inasmuch as in each instance extensive visceral growths had given rise to the metastases...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Raised blood {{pressure}} is common in acute stroke, and is {{associated with an increased}} risk of poor outcomes. We aimed to examine whether careful blood-pressure lowering treatment with the angiotensin-receptor blocker candesartan is beneficial in patients with acute stroke and raised {{blood pressure}}. METHODS: Participants in this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial were recruited from 146 centres in nine north European countries. Patients older than 18 years with acute stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) and systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher were included within 30 h of symptom onset. Patients were randomly allocated to candesartan or placebo (1 : 1) for 7 days, with doses increasing from 4 mg on day 1 to 16 mg on days 3 to 7. Randomisation was stratified by centre, with blocks of six packs of candesartan or placebo. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. There were two co-primary effect variables: the composite endpoint of vascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke during the first 6 months; and functional outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. Analyses were by intention to treat. The study is registered, number NCT 00120003 (ClinicalTrials. gov), and ISRCTN 13643354. FINDINGS: 2029 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups (1017 candesartan, 1012 placebo), and data for status at 6 months were available for 2004 patients (99 %; 1000 candesartan, 1004 placebo). During the 7 -day treatment period, blood pressures were significantly lower in patients allocated candesartan than in those on placebo (mean 147 / 82 mm Hg [SD 23 / 14] in the candesartan group on day 7 vs 152 / 84 mm Hg [22 / 14] in the placebo group; p< 0 · 0001). During 6 months' follow-up, the risk of the composite vascular endpoint did not differ between treatment groups (candesartan, 120 events, vs placebo, 111 events; adjusted hazard ratio 1 · 09, 95 % CI 0 · 84 - 1 · 41; p= 0 · 52). Analysis of functional outcome suggested a higher risk of poor outcome in the candesartan group (adjusted common odds ratio 1 · 17, 95 % CI 1 · 00 - 1 · 38; p= 0 · 048 [not significant at p≤ 0 · 025 level]). The observed effects were similar for all prespecified secondary endpoints (including death from any cause, vascular death, ischaemic stroke, <b>haemorrhagic</b> stroke, myocardial <b>infarction,</b> stroke progression, symptomatic hypotension, and renal failure) and outcomes (Scandinavian Stroke Scale score at 7 days and Barthel index at 6 months), and {{there was no evidence of}} a differential effect in any of the prespecified subgroups. During follow-up, nine (1 %) patients on candesartan and five (< 1 %) on placebo had symptomatic hypotension, and renal failure was reported for 18 (2 %) patients taking candesartan and 13 (1 %) allocated placebo. INTERPRETATION: There was no indication that careful blood-pressure lowering treatment with the angiotensin-receptor blocker candesartan is beneficial in patients with acute stroke and raised blood pressure. If anything, the evidence suggested a harmful effect. FUNDING: South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority; Oslo University Hospital Ullevål; AstraZeneca; Takeda. status: publishe...|$|R

We found four studies meeting our criteria, from which we extracted case reports on 19 individuals with intraventricular <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction.</b> Eleven of the 19 did not have visual field defects, five had a bilateral visual field defect, and the remaining three had a unilateral visual field defect. The involvement of the optic radiations was often associated with normal visual fields as only one of the four individuals with damaged optic radiations showed visual field defects. Conversely, the presence of basal ganglia/thalamus involvement apparently prevented such reorganization, as the only two individuals with unilateral field restriction and available magnetic resonance imaging data both showed abnormalities in those structures. Consistent with this, we report on a further individual in which visual field restriction was associated with abnormal tractography on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, this review supports the existence of effective mechanisms of plastic reorganization that allow a rewiring of geniculo-calcarine connections with restoration of full field vision but which are hindered by {{the involvement of the}} basal ganglia and thalamus...|$|E
40|$|A 53 -year-old {{male with}} {{compensated}} cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A 5) and mixed cryoglobulinaemia (cryocrit: 2. 0 %), both hepatitis C virus-related, {{was treated with}} pegylated interferon-alpha 2 b and ribavirin. After three months of therapy, he developed segmental jejunal vasculitis requiring emergency resection of an ischaemic intestinal loop 60 cm long. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed signs of ischaemic injury with <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction</b> due to arteritis and arterial occlusion. The postoperative course was complicated by progressive liver and renal failure {{that led to the}} patient's death six months after surgery. To our knowledge, ischaemic jejunal vasculitis has never been reported during interferon therapy, but the latter treatment may have played causative roles...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathological {{findings}} {{in children who}} had died of cerebral arteriovenous malformation under 6 years of age were contrasted with those of children aged 6 to 15 years. In all subjects, the abnormalities were more marked in the shunting vessels and veins distal to the arteriovenous shunt than in the arteries. Fibrous thickening, calcification an adherent thrombus of vessel wall, and gliosis and haemosiderin in contiguous neural tissue were {{more common in the}} older than the younger children. Children less than 1 week old with vein of Galen malformations presented with congestive heart failure and "watershed" cerebral infarction; most of those over one week old had hydrocephalus and venous thrombosis with <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction...</b>|$|E
40|$|A 3 -year-old female alpaca was {{referred}} to the hospital because of tenesmus. Clinical examination revealed a habitual vaginal prolapse with tenesmus during urination and defecation. On vaginoscopic examination a persistent hymen was detected. Ultrasonography of the caudal abdomen showed an echogenic fluid-filled uterus. A diagnostic laparotomy led to diagnosis of pyometra. Following ovariohysterectomy, the recovery was uneventful. One {{and a half years}} later the alpaca was again admitted to the hospital because of colic. Based on the findings, a tentative prognosis was provided and the alpaca was euthanized at the request of the owner. At necropsy, a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction</b> of a jejunal loop was found due to incarceration in a fibrous adhesion between the vaginal stump and small intestine...|$|E
30|$|The {{larger the}} leiomyoma, {{the more likely}} {{that some form of}} {{degeneration}} will be present. The type of degeneration depends on the degree and rapidity of the onset of vascular insufficiency caused by the enlarging leiomyoma outgrowing its blood supply. The most common form is hyaline degeneration, which usually undergoes liquefaction with the formation of cystic spaces without epithelial linings. These cystic areas are filled with a colourless or blood-stained fluid. Red degeneration results from <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction</b> and occurs in approximately 8 % of leiomyomas, complicating pregnancy. The process is often the cause of pain, fever and low-grade leukocytosis [9]. The degree of degeneration does not necessarily correlate with the severity of symptoms, and in this case, there was no history of symptomatology suggestive of degeneration.|$|E
