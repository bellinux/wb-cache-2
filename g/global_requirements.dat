5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E

The derivation process transforms the <b>global</b> system <b>requirements</b> described as UML diagram activities (extended with collaborations) to system roles behaviors represented as UML finite state machines.

40|$|Access-control {{requirements}} for physical spaces, like {{office buildings and}} airports, are best formulated from a global viewpoint in terms of system-wide requirements. For example, "there is an authorized path to exit the building from every room. " In contrast, individual access-control components, such as doors and turnstiles, can only enforce local policies, specifying when the component may open. In practice, {{the gap between the}} system-wide, <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> and the many local policies is bridged manually, which is tedious, error-prone, and scales poorly. We propose a framework to automatically synthesize local access control policies from a set of <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> for physical spaces. Our framework consists of an expressive language to specify both <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> and physical spaces, and an algorithm for synthesizing local, attribute-based policies from the global specification. We empirically demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on three substantial case studies. The studies demonstrate that access control synthesis is practical even for complex physical spaces, such as airports, with many interrelated security requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the early development phases of distributed applications, service compositions and workflow systems. It deals with the transformation of a <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> model, which makes abstraction from the physical distribution of the different system functions, into a system design that identifies a certain number of distributed components. The temporal constraints of the <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> on the execution of the different activities imply certain coordination messages between the different system components. The paper presents a transformation algorithm that derives, from a given global behavior, the local behaviors for each of the system components including the exchange of coordination messages for the global synchronization of the activities. In contrast to earlier work, strong and weak sequencing is distinguished and the primitive sub-activities included in the global behavior descriptions may be collaborations involving several components...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRequirements {{documentation}} is {{a collection}} of partial specifications produced by different stakeholders. Obtaining a global specification is a fundamental step of a requirement analysis process. Merging requirement specifications is indeed a way to reveal inconsistencies between them. We propose in this paper a model-driven mechanism for that purpose. It takes as inputs a set of texts or models which conform to input requirement languages and produces a <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> model. This mechanism is integrated in a platform called R 2 A which stands for ?requirements to analysis?. The R 2 A core element is its core requirement metamodel which has been defined for capturing the <b>global</b> <b>requirements</b> model. We illustrate our approach with requirement specifications expressed in a constrained natural language. This platform and its mechanism have been completely implemented with MDE (Model Driven Engineering) technologies. As such, it {{is a good example of}} how MDE technologies can contribute to requirements engineering as a technical solution...|$|E
