40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to obtain {{quantitative}} data on the metabolic flows (energy consumption, {{not only by the}} establishment but also in the transportation of workers and customers, and packaging use) and their resulting environmental impacts of a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> purchase in five city center municipal markets and a hypermarket in a suburban retail park in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The main results show that a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> purchased in a retail park requires 20 times more energy than one purchased in a municipal market (11. 1 kWh and 0. 57 kWh, respectively). Customer transportation represents 83. 2 % of energy consumption in a retail park, while the greatest impacts in a municipal market stem from the establishment itself (49. 5 %) and worker transportation (40. 4 %). Secondly, the packaging use inventory is higher in a hypermarket (253 g) than in a municipal market (102 g). However, the overall environmental impact associated with a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> is 10 times higher on average in a hypermarket than in a municipal market, and the carbon footprints of the hypermarket and the municipal market are 3. 8 and 0. 4 kg of CO₂ eq., respectively. According to the sensitivity analysis, current policies for reducing the amount of plastic bag packaging have little repercussion in a retail park because its relative weight in terms of total packaging use is only 7 %. Nevertheless, they have notable effects in municipal markets where plastic bags represent 25 % of the packaging use. Finally, if customers selected the least packaged products available in hypermarkets, each <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> could reduce up to 47. 2 % of its used packaging weight and between 15. 4 and 59. 0 % of its associated environmental impact...|$|R
