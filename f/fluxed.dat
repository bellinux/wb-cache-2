40|$|Metabolic <b>fluxes</b> {{in cells}} {{are governed by}} physical, biochemical, physiological, and {{economic}} principles. Cells may show "economical" behaviour, trading metabolic performance against the costly side-effects of high enzyme or metabolite concentrations. Some constraint-based <b>flux</b> prediction methods score <b>fluxes</b> by heuristic <b>flux</b> costs as proxies of enzyme investments. However, linear cost functions ignore enzyme kinetics and the tight coupling between <b>fluxes,</b> metabolite levels and enzyme levels. To derive more realistic cost functions, I define an apparent "enzymatic <b>flux</b> cost" as the minimal enzyme cost at which the <b>fluxes</b> can be realised in a given kinetic model, and a "kinetic <b>flux</b> cost", which includes metabolite cost. I discuss the mathematical properties of such <b>flux</b> cost functions, their usage for <b>flux</b> prediction, and their importance for cells' metabolic strategies. The enzymatic <b>flux</b> cost scales linearly with the <b>fluxes</b> and is a concave function on the <b>flux</b> polytope. The costs of two flows are usually not additive, due to an additional "compromise cost". Between <b>flux</b> polytopes, where <b>fluxes</b> change their directions, the enzymatic cost shows a jump. With strictly concave <b>flux</b> cost functions, cells can reduce their enzymatic cost by running different <b>fluxes</b> in different cell compartments or at different moments in time. The enzymactic <b>flux</b> cost can be translated into an approximated cell growth rate, a convex function on the <b>flux</b> polytope. Growth-maximising metabolic states can be predicted by <b>Flux</b> Cost Minimisation (FCM), a variant of FBA based on general <b>flux</b> cost functions. The solutions are <b>flux</b> distributions in corners of the <b>flux</b> polytope, i. e. typically elementary <b>flux</b> modes. Enzymatic <b>flux</b> costs can be linearly or nonlinearly approximated, providing model parameters for linear FBA based on kinetic parameters and extracellular concentrations, and justified by a kinetic model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Surface <b>fluxes,</b> {{originating}} from forest patches, are commonly calculated from atmospheric <b>flux</b> measurements at some height above that patch using a cor-rection for <b>flux</b> arising from upwind surfaces. Footprint {{models have been}} developed to calculate such a correction. These models commonly assume homogeneous tur-bulence, resulting in a simulated atmospheric <b>flux</b> equal to the average surface <b>flux</b> in the footprint area. However, atmospheric scalar <b>fluxes</b> downwind of a forest edge have been observed to exceed surface <b>fluxes</b> in the footprint area. Variations in atmo-spheric turbulence downwind of the forest edge, as simulated with an E – ε model, can explain enhanced atmospheric scalar <b>fluxes.</b> This E – ε model is used to calculate the footprint of atmospheric measurements downwind of a forest edge. Atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> appear mainly enhanced {{as a result of a}} stronger sensitivity to <b>fluxes</b> from the upwind surface. A sensitivity analysis shows that the fetch over forest, necessary to reach equilibrium between atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> and surface <b>fluxes,</b> tends to be longer for scalar <b>fluxes</b> as compared to momentum <b>fluxes.</b> With increasing forest density, atmospheric <b>fluxes</b> deviate even more strongly from surface <b>fluxes,</b> but over shorter fetches. It is concluded that scalar <b>fluxes</b> over forests are commonly affected by inho-mogeneous turbulence over large fetches downwind of an edge. It is recommended to take horizontal variations in turbulence into account when the footprint is calcu-lated for atmospheric <b>flux</b> measurements downwind of a forest edge.

50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, <b>fluxed</b> and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible {{around the edge of the}} fitting and allowed to cool.|$|E

50|$|Hiberni (Ireland), Pictish (northern Britain) and Britons (southern Britain) tribes, all {{speaking}} Insular Celtic, {{inhabited the}} islands {{at the beginning}} of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland <b>fluxed</b> between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919-1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|For {{both the}} {{practical}} application and {{scientific study of}} chalcogenide glasses, glass purity is of utmost importance. Varying levels of trace impurities, even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass. Similarly, impurities are a major concern for optical components. Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass, contribute {{to the loss of}} power through an optical component, whether it {{is in the form of}} a long glass fiber or an infrared window. These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization.Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available, with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals, even this level of purity is often not sufficient, particularly for optical fiber applications.More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide, gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide. Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements, the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide, water or organic impurities. It is not unheard of to find for example, commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production.The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of sealed ampoule melting. In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule, melted, and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule. The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures. This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limitsthe ultimate quality of the glass that is produced. In addition, impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls.The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality. In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting,chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass, in both thin film and bulk glass form. Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3, La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed. This allows melting in an open atmosphere, under a flowing inert gas, typically argon. Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed vessel. Melting is typically at 1150 °C for 24 hours. The molten gallium sulfides <b>fluxed</b> the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points. The viscosity of the melt is low enough, at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a rocking furnace which is required for melting in an ampoule. The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a water cooled jacket. An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away, a significant advantage over sealed systems. For example, no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses, compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the sealed ampoule technique.|$|E
