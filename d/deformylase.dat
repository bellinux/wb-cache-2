50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formyl-L-glutamate amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include beta-citryl-L-glutamate hydrolase, formylglutamate <b>deformylase,</b> N-formylglutamate hydrolase, beta-citrylglutamate amidase, beta-citryl-L-glutamate amidohydrolase, beta-citryl-L-glutamate amidase, beta-citrylglutamate amidase, and beta-citryl-L-glutamate-hydrolyzing enzyme. This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.|$|E
50|$|In living organisms, {{the start}} codon that initiates protein {{synthesis}} codes for either methionine (eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (prokaryotes). In E. coli (prokaryote), an enzyme called formylmethionine <b>deformylase</b> can cleave the formyl group, leaving just the N-terminal methionine residue. For proteins with small, uncharged penultimate N-terminal residues, a methionine aminopeptidase can cleave the methionine residue.The number of genes encoding for a methionine aminopeptidase varies between organisms. In E. coli, {{there is only}} one known MetAP, a 29,333 Da monomeric enzyme coded for by a gene consisting of 264 codons. The knockout of this gene in E. coli leads to cell inviability. In humans, there are two genes encoding MetAP, MetAP1 and MetAP2. MetAP1 codes for a 42 kDa enzyme, while MetAP2 codes for a 67 kDa enzyme. Yeast MetAP1 is 40 percent homologous to E. coli MetAP; within S. cerevisiae, MetAP2 is 22 percent homologous with the sequence of MetAP1; MetAP2 is highly conserved between S. cerevisiae and humans. In contrast to prokaryotes, eukaryotic S. cerevisiae strains lacking the gene for either MetAP1 or MetAP2 are viable, but exhibit a slower growth rate than a control strain expressing both genes.|$|E
40|$|Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia- 0) genes, AtDEF 1 and AtDEF 2, {{represent}} eukaryotic homologs of {{the essential}} prokaryotic gene encoding peptide <b>deformylase.</b> Both deduced proteins contain three conserved protein motifs found in the active site of all eubacterial peptide deformylases, and N-terminal extensions identifiable as chloroplast-targeting sequences. Radiolabeled full-length AtDEF 1 was imported and processed by isolated pea (Pisum sativum L. Laxton's Progress No. 9) chloroplasts and AtDEF 1 and 2 were immunologically detected in Arabidopsis leaf and chloroplast stromal protein extracts. The partial cDNAs encoding the processed forms of Arabidopsis peptide <b>deformylase</b> 1 and 2 (pAtDEF 1 and 2, respectively) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using C-terminal hexahistidyl tags. Both recombinant Arabidopsis peptide deformylases had peptide <b>deformylase</b> activity with unique kinetic parameters that differed from those reported for the E. coli enzyme. Actinonin, a specific peptide <b>deformylase</b> inhibitor, was effective in vitro against Arabidopsis peptide <b>deformylase</b> 1 and 2 activity, respectively. Exposure of several plant species including Arabidopsis to actinonin resulted in chlorosis and severe reductions in plant growth and development. The results suggest an essential role for peptide <b>deformylase</b> in protein processing in all plant plastids...|$|E

40|$|Peptide <b>deformylase</b> {{is found}} only in Eubacteria, making it a logical target for {{discovering}} new antibacterial agents. Although this protein is absent from animal or fungal cells, evidence supports its existence in eukaryotic protists, including the causative agents of malaria, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniosis. Here, Thierry Meinnel discusses the idea that <b>deformylase</b> inhibitors {{could be used as}} very broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacterial infections, as well as parasitic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{discovery}} in crude extracts {{in the late}} sixties, Escherichia coli peptide <b>deformylase</b> activity could not be further characterized because of an apparent extreme instability. We show that this behavior was caused by an inadequate activity assay, involving substrate concentration inhibition and substrate precipitation in crude extracts. The homogeneous protein, as it was previously purified (T. Meinnel and S. Blanquet J. Bacteriol. 175 : 7737 - 7740, 1993), had actually retained its initial activity. The influence on the deformylation reaction of several factors was studied and used to improve the activity assay. Pure peptide <b>deformylase</b> proves to act only on peptide substrates with an N-formylmethionyl moiety. In agreement with the occurrence of zinc in the enzyme, peptide <b>deformylase</b> activity is inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline...|$|E

40|$|Peptide <b>deformylase,</b> a {{bacterial}} enzyme, represents a novel target for antibiotic discovery. Two <b>deformylase</b> homologs, defA and defB, {{were identified in}} Staphylococcus aureus. The defA homolog, located upstream of the transformylase gene, was identified by genomic analysis and was cloned from chromosomal DNA by PCR. A distinct homolog, defB, was cloned from an S. aureus genomic library by complementation of the arabinose-dependent phenotype of a PBAD-def Escherichia coli strain grown under arabinose-limiting conditions. Overexpression in E. coli of defB, but not defA, correlated to increased <b>deformylase</b> activity and decreased susceptibility to actinonin, a deformylase-specific inhibitor. The defB gene could not be disrupted in wild-type S. aureus, suggesting that this gene, which encodes a functional <b>deformylase,</b> is essential. In contrast, the defA gene could be inactivated; the function of this gene is unknown. Actinonin-resistant mutants grew slowly in vitro and did not show cross-resistance to other classes of antibiotics. When compared to the parent, an actinonin-resistant strain produced an attenuated infection in a murine abscess model, indicating that this strain also has a growth disadvantage in vivo. Sequence analysis of the actinonin-resistant mutants revealed that each harbors a loss-of-function mutation in the fmt gene. Susceptibility to actinonin was restored when the wild-type fmt gene was introduced into these mutant strains. An S. aureus Δfmt strain was also resistant to actinonin, suggesting that a functional <b>deformylase</b> activity is not required in a strain that lacks formyltransferase activity. Accordingly, the defB gene could be disrupted in an fmt mutant...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to peptide <b>deformylase</b> inhibitors in Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus {{is due to}} {{inactivation}} of transformylase activity.

Actinonin-resistant mutants of S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 harbor mutations in defB but not in fmt. Reintroduction of the mutated defB gene into wild-type S. pneumoniae R 6 x recreates the resistance phenotype. The altered enzyme displays decreased sensitivity to actinonin...|$|E
40|$|Polypeptide <b>deformylase</b> (PDF) catalyzes the deformylation of {{polypeptide}} chains in bacteria. It {{is essential}} for bacterial cell viability and is a potential antibacterial drug target. Here, we report the crystal structures of polypeptide <b>deformylase</b> from four different species of bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Comparison of these four structures reveals significant overall {{differences between the two}} Gram-negative species (E. coli and H. influenzae) and the two Gram-positive species (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). Despite these differences and low overall sequence identity, the S 1 ′ pocket of PDF is well conserved among the four enzymes studied. We also describe the binding of nonpeptidic inhibitor molecules SB- 485345, SB- 543668, and SB- 505684 to both S. pneumoniae and E. coli PDF. Comparison of these structures shows similar binding interactions with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. Understanding the similarities and subtle differences in active site structure between species will help to design broad-spectrum polypeptide <b>deformylase</b> inhibitor molecules...|$|E
40|$|Peptide <b>deformylase</b> inhibitors (PDFIs) {{appear to}} be one of the most {{exciting}} classes of antibacterial agents discovered to date. Rapid progress in the development of PDFIs has been possible because peptide <b>deformylase</b> is a metalloprotease, and this class of enzymes shows a high degree of structure-function conservation, and because the most potent PDFIs are hydroxamate derivatives, a well known category of pharmacophores. The current challenge in structure-activity relationship analysis is obtaining molecules with potent in vivo antibacterial activity against a range of drug-resistant pathogens. The PDFIs currently in clinical trials target community-based bacterial infections, with a potential major pharmaceutical market...|$|E
40|$|An Escherichia coli strain with thermosensitive {{expression}} of the gene encoding peptide <b>deformylase</b> (fms) has been constructed. At nonpermissive temperatures, this strain fails to grow. The essential character of the fms gene was further used to clone by heterologous complementation the locus corresponding to Thermus thermophilus peptide <b>deformylase.</b> The cloned fragment also carries the methionyl-tRNA(fMet) formyltransferase gene (fmt). It is located immediately downstream from the fms gene, as in E. coli. Further sequence analysis of the region surrounding the E. coli fms-fmt locus indicates that the genes bordering the fms-fmt region are not conserved in T. thermophilus...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial peptide <b>deformylase</b> (PDF) {{belongs to}} a {{sub-family}} of metalloproteases that catalyse {{the removal of the}} N-terminal formyl group from newly synthesised proteins. PDF is essential in prokaryotes and conserved throughout the eubacteria. It is therefore considered an attractive target for developing new antibacterial agents. Here, we report the crystal structures of four bacterial deformylases, free or bound to the naturally occurring antibiotic actinonin, including two from the major bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The overall tertiary structure is essentially conserved but shows significant differences, namely at the C terminus, which are directly related to the <b>deformylase</b> type (i. e. I or II) they belong to. The geometry around the catalytic metal ion exhibits a high level of similarity within the different enzymes, as does the binding mode of actinonin to the various deformylases. However, some significant structural differences are found {{in the vicinity of the}} active site, highlighting the structural and molecular requirements for the design of a <b>deformylase</b> inhibitor active against a broad spectrum of bacterial strains...|$|E
40|$|<b>Deformylase</b> {{performs}} {{an essential}} {{step in the}} maturation of proteins in eubacteria, by removing the formyl group from the N-terminal methionine residue of ribosome-synthesized polypeptides. In spite of this important role in translation, the enzyme had so far eluded characterization because of its instability. We report {{the isolation of the}} <b>deformylase</b> gene of Escherichia coli, def, by overexpression of a genomic library from a high-copy-number plasmid and selection for utilization of the substrate analogue formyl-leucyl-methionine as a source of methionine. The def gene encodes a 169 amino acid polypeptide that bears no obvious resemblance to other known proteins. It forms an operon with the fmt gene, that encodes the initiator methionyl-tRNA(i) transformylase, which was recently characterized (Guillon et al., J. Bacteriol., 174, 4294 - 4301, 1992). This operon was mapped at min 72 of the E. coli chromosome. The def gene could be inactivated if the fmt gene was also inactivated, or if biosynthesis of N 10 -formyl-tetrahydrofolate, the formyl donor in methionyl-tRNA(i) transformylation, was blocked by trimethoprim. These findings designate <b>deformylase</b> as a target for antibacterial chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The N-terminal protein {{processing}} pathway is {{an essential}} mechanism found in all organisms. However, {{it is widely believed}} that <b>deformylase,</b> a key enzyme involved in this process in bacteria, does not exist in eukaryotes, thus making it a target for antibacterial agents such as actinonin. In an attempt to define this process in higher eukaryotes we have used Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. Two <b>deformylase</b> cDNAs, the first identified in any eukaryotic system, and six distinct methionine aminopeptidase cDNAs were cloned. The corresponding proteins were characterized in vivo and in vitro. Methionine aminopeptidases were found in the cytoplasm and in the organelles, while deformylases were localized in the organelles only. Our work shows that higher plants have a much more complex machinery for methionine removal than previously suspected. We were also able to identify <b>deformylase</b> homologues from several animals and clone the corresponding cDNA from human cells. Our data provide the first evidence that lower and higher eukaryotes, as well as bacteria, share a similar N-terminal protein processing machinery, indicating universality of this system...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{assessed}} {{the potential of}} peptide <b>deformylase</b> (PDF) as a target for broad spectrum antibacterial agents. By using a number of approaches, including proteomics, researchers at Roche {{have shown that the}} molecules they had selected in vitro were able to target PDF in vivo. However, the authors, having observed resistance occurring at a rather high frequency and {{on the basis of the}} recent discovery of a <b>deformylase</b> homologue in humans, suggest that PDF 'may not be an optimal target for broad spectrum antibacterial agents'. We link these data to results published by other laboratories and conclude that PDF deserves to still be considered a valuable target for new antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|A formylmethionine <b>deformylase</b> from rat small-intestinal mucosa {{has been}} isolated, {{characterized}} and partially purified. The enzyme catalyses {{the release of}} equimolar amounts of formate and the free amino acid. The <b>deformylase</b> was active against formylmethionine (Km 7. 1 mM) and formylnorleucine, but showed reduced activity against formyl-leucine. It was inactive against a range of other polar and nonpolar formyl-amino acids and against formyl di- and tri-peptides. The Mr of the native enzyme was between 45, 000 and 66, 000, as determined by h. p. l. c. gel permeation. Further purification of the enzyme either by h. p. l. c. ion-exchange chromatography and concanavalin A-Sepharose or by isoelectric focusing yielded a preparation with one predominant band of Mr 50, 000 on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Bacteria in the intestine present the host with substantial amounts of formylmethionine (fMet) from proteinase and carboxypeptidase digestion of bacterial formyl-peptides in the intestinal lumen. fMet (0. 01 - 1. 0 mM) inhibited translation of a test RNA from brome mosaic virus in vitro, indicating {{that it could have}} adverse effects on cellular metabolism. Gut epithelial fMet <b>deformylase</b> may be required for deformylation of this exogenous (bacterial) and also endogenous (mitochondrial) fMet...|$|E
40|$|All {{bacteria}} initiate translation using formylated methionine, yet directly after translation, the formyl-group is removed. This {{sequence of}} addition and removal appears futile, yet every sequenced bacterial genome encodes the enzymes for formylation and deformylation, suggesting {{this process is}} essential. Puzzlingly, the process is absent from both Archaea and Eukaryotes, and moreover, bacterial mutants lacking both the formylase and <b>deformylase</b> activities are viable, albeit with a diminished growth rate. We created an Escherichia coli strain devoid of formylase and <b>deformylase</b> activity. This strain was then allowed to evolve over 1500 generations whereupon it reached wild-type growth rate, demonstrating that formylation can be completely dispensed with. This raises an additional question: if the formylation cycle is unnecessary, how did it emerge and why has it persisted? Our {{results show that the}} formylation-deformylation cycle could have evolved as a toxin-antitoxin pair (TA) with post-segregational killing (PSK) activity. TAs ‘addict’ cells to the plasmids that carry them by inducing PSK. We measured the stability of formylase-deformylase encoding plasmids and their ability to elicit PSK in our evolved E. coli strain. We report several lines of evidence consistent with the formylation-cycle having evolved from a plasmid-borne PSK element: 1) in the absence of deformylation, formyl-methionine on proteins is cytotoxic in bacteria 2) deformylation relieves the cytotoxicity of formyl-methionine, 3) the loss of a plasmid containing formylase and <b>deformylase</b> genes from evolved cells results in cessation of growth – a standard PSK phenotype. In addition, we introduced the E. coli formylase and <b>deformylase</b> genes into yeast and demonstrate that Met-tRNA formylation is not lethal, {{even in the absence of}} deformylation. This suggests PSK would be ineffectual in yeast, accounting for the absence of formylation from eukaryotic cytoplasmic translation. We also report the presence of formylase and <b>deformylase</b> genes in the two representative members of the archaeal Methanocopusculum genus. Moreover, we demonstrate that these genes have been acquired by a recent horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Our results indicate that formylmethionine use in bacteria evolved, not through a direct functional benefit to cells, but through competition between infectious genetic elements...|$|E
