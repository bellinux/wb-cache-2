25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> {{that the}} urea {{conversion}} reaction is slow—because {{if it were}} not it would go into reverse in the stripper.

25|$|Basankusu <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> {{for having}} a good {{underground}} water supply and many houses have on-site water hand pumps. Habitat for Humanity has an established housing project here. Basankusu has grown rapidly since the recent national troubles of the two Congo Wars. Reasons for {{this may be the}} large increase in the population nationally, as well as migration from outlying villages. Migration is partly due to hardship caused by the lack of river transport and the poor access to everyday goods that has resulted.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is rich in}} mineral {{resources}} and fertile farm soil, and it <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have a moderate climate. It also has extensive coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, {{as well as on}} the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers flow from far within the continent and the Great Lakes—five large, inland lakes along the U.S. border with Canada—provide additional shipping access. These extensive waterways have helped shape the country's economic growth over the years and helped bind America's 50 individual states together in a single economic unit.|$|E

25|$|The National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution {{contains}} (among other things) the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) certified proofs and the Treasury Department {{collection of}} United States currency. Using {{a combination of}} proofs and issued notes, a nearly complete type set of high-denomination currency was compiled. Notably missing are several types of Compound and Interest Bearing Notes. Printed during the early to mid-1860s on very thin paper, these high-denomination notes are virtually non-existent. Their issuance (1861–65) pre-dates the BEP's responsibility for U.S. Currency (1870s), so it <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> that any proofs exist in the current archives.|$|E
25|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> {{that the}} second {{performance}} survives from an era when little television was preserved, the play is well known only amongst archive television enthusiasts and science fiction fans. It was twenty-three years before it received a repeat broadcast in 1977. Another proposed repeat {{as part of the}} BBC's fiftieth anniversary of television celebrations in 1986 was overruled by the producers of the 1984 John Hurt/Richard Burton feature film, who felt that earlier versions would affect income for their film. The BBC was permitted to show the play again in 1994 on BBC Two, as a tribute to the recently deceased Cartier and again in June 2003 on digital station BBC Four as part of the George Orwell centenary celebrations.|$|E
25|$|Atli {{discusses}} matters with Guðrún. She {{tells him}} that things will go badly for him unless he kills her too. He tries to console her by promising precious gifts and she pretends to relent, asking Atli for a great ale-feast to commemorate her brothers. Guðrún then kills their two sons and has the unsuspecting Atli use their heads as drinking vessels and eat their roasted hearts. Later Guðrún kills Atli {{with the aid of}} Hniflungr, son of Högni. The final part of the poem consists of exchanges between Guðrún and Atli. Guðrún recalls her glorious past when she went harrying with Sigurðr and her brothers. Atli recalls his marriage proposal to Guðrún and how she was never content in their marriage, despite all their riches. In the end he asks Guðrún to give him an honorable burial and she agrees. She then attempts suicide and fails. The poem ends on a note that any man who begets such offspring as Gjúki's <b>is</b> <b>fortunate.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Entrance <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> {{to have a}} broad {{selection}} of sporting, both organised and casual, facilities. This includes The Entrance Ocean Baths – a three pool salt water complex with free access all year around. Taylor Park is the main playing field in the town hosting cricket matches. The Entrance beach {{has one of the}} oldest surf clubs in the region, housed in an art deco building overlooking the beach. The Entrance Skate Park at Picnic Point allows free access to a purpose built skate board area. The Entrance Cycle & Walking track, is a concrete path starting in at Picnic Point allowing for off road cycling alongside the lake. Fishing and boat ramp facilities are located at Picnic Point. The Entrance Memorial Park is located {{at the heart of the}} town and features a band stand with stunning views across the channel and lake. The park is home to the town Christmas tree, festooned with coloured lights every December.|$|E
25|$|The town <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> {{that the}} Christchurch Priory cartulary, which {{consists}} of over 1,300 documents and charters copied and collated in the 14th century, with a few later additions, has survived to provide a comprehensive account of the Priory and events connected to it during the medieval period. A full translation was published in 2007. The evolution of the Priory into the building it is today took place over many centuries: The nave and transepts are Norman with heavy columns and round arches, whereas the lady chapel is from the 14th century and more Perpendicular in style. The great choir is even later, having been rebuilt in the 16th Century. The Priory is noted for its Miraculous Beam, which attracts pilgrims {{from all over the}} world. From the reign of Edward I, after mass on Sundays, the church wardens supervised the archery practice that all men were obliged to undertake. This event took place on a piece of unconsecrated land between the north porch and transept. The requirement for the men of the town to practise archery continued until Tudor times.|$|E
25|$|Lancaster, as a {{historic}} city, {{has a wide}} range of historic buildings and venues. The city <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have retained many fine examples of Georgian architecture. Lancaster Castle, the Priory Church of St. Mary and the Edwardian Ashton Memorial are among many sites of historical importance. The city has numerous museums,including Lancaster City Museum, Maritime Museum, the Cottage Museum, and Judges' Lodgings Museum. Lancaster Friends Meeting House dating from 1708, is the longest continual Quaker meeting site in the world with the original building built in 1677. George Fox, founder of Quakerism, was near the site several occasions in the 1660s and spent two years imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. The meeting house today holds regular Quaker meetings and {{a wide range of}} cultural activities including adult learning, meditation, art classes, music and political meetings. The Lancaster Grand Theatre is another one of Lancaster historic cultural venues, under its many names, has been {{a major part of the}} social and cultural life of Lancaster since being built in 1782.|$|E

William Adam's obituary in the Caledonian Mercury noted that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>fortunate</b> he has left behind him some promising young men to carry on what he has so happily begun". John Adam passed Blair Adam on to his own son, lawyer and politician William Adam KC, whose descendants continue to own the estate, and have included several notable politicians, soldiers and civil servants.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode {{and gave it}} an A. He applauded {{the fact that it}} [...] "lets Scully be flawed" [...] and allowed her to be [...] "far more human" [...] than usual on the show. Handlen concluded that the episode was a success because it illustrated [...] "the way our need to connect with others makes us vulnerable". He was, however, critical of Mulder's actions in the episode, calling him a [...] "spoiled ass" [...] and noted that there was a [...] "little boy ignored feel to his dialogue at the end". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "one of the best character studies of the entire series". He concluded that [...] "Much of Scully’s underlying psychology is explored in this episode, and in keeping with what has been revealed about Mulder, it’s not pretty. The final act doesn’t quite match the intensity of the third, but it’s rather clear what the writers were trying to convey." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com wrote positively of the episode and noted that [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>fortunate,</b> I think, that the Super Bowl forced the change in sequence." [...] She argued that, had “Leonard Betts” not aired before [...] "Never Again", the audience would have been forced to [...] "read her actions as reactions to Mulder and Mulder alone" [...] rather than against the fact that she has cancer.|$|E
