2500|$|The 1965 Skylark Gran Sport was the {{intermediate}} Buick Skylark with the Gran Sport option added. [...] Although a [...] V8 was already {{offered in the}} Skylark, the Gran Sport had the largest engine permitted by GM - a [...] Buick V8. [...] This engine was actually , but called a [...] "400" [...] by Buick {{because that was the}} maximum engine size limit set by General Motors for {{the intermediate}} body cars. This engine produced 325hp (242kW) and 445lb·ft (603Nm) and was known as the [...] "nailhead" [...] engine. Buick sold more than 15,000 Skylarks with the Gran Sport option that first year, and almost as many the next. [...] It was renamed the GS 400 in 1967, and the Gran Sport became its own model in (about) that same year along with a new [...] "400" [...] engine quite different from the famously reliable but becoming-obsolete nailhead engine design that was first introduced in 1953. Sales fell somewhat in the face of increasingly higher-performance and more popular muscle cars from other marques when compared to those from the more stodgy and expensive Buick. Buick, however, stepped <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> when introducing the Stage 1 option in 1969. [...] This limited production (less than 1,500 cars in 1969) version delivered 340hp (253kW) and 440lb·ft (597Nm).|$|E

The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script.

The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X.

Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|R

2500|$|On 25 December Satono Diamond was matched against older {{opposition}} {{when he was}} one {{of sixteen}} horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama. He was made the 2.6/1 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Kitasan Black and the 2015 winner Gold Actor. The other runners included Sounds of Earth (second in 2015), Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten, Copa Republica Argentina), Marialite (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Takarazuka Kinen) and Mikki Queen (Yushun Himba, Shuka Sho). Satono Diamond raced in mid-division on the outside as the Maltese Apogee set the pace from Kitasan Black. He moved up to third place entering the straight before producing a late burst of acceleration to overtake Kitasan Black well inside the last 100 metres and win by a neck with Gold Actor half a length away in third place. Lemaire said [...] "He is such an easy ride. He makes my job so easy. He was a little slow to react on the last turn. But he was so strong in front of goal. He has such a big heart", whilst Ikee commented [...] "It’s a huge relief. He’ll be able to take <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> or two next season. He should really come into his own by the fall. He just beat the best horses in all of Japan as a 3-year-old, which is great and gives us {{something to look forward to}} next year." ...|$|E

To the man committed to a career in politics, Bruno represents a tempting overthrow of all responsibility." [...] And at this point the blurring of good and evil accelerates: Guy fails to repudiate Bruno's suggestive statement about murdering Miriam ("What's a life or two, Guy? Some people are better off dead.") with any force or conviction. [...] "When Bruno openly suggests he would like to kill his wife, he merely grins and says 'That's a morbid thought,' but we sense the tension that underlies it."

White continues on to say that [...] "the worship leaders from Bethel seriously outdo themselves with their musical influence, heavy synth, and wisely put-together arrangements of songs." [...] When talking about the songs, he said [...] "One of the songs that stuck out to me the most was Brian Johnson and Kari Jobe's [...] "Forever." [...] The arrangement feel and sounds like rendition of both Brian and Kari's version of the song. I was never a big fan of this song - until I heard this version. It takes every emotional influence the song has to offer, and takes <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> few <b>notches.</b> The title song, [...] "You Make Me Brave," [...] sounds and feels very, very personal. Jen said herself, [...] "What was celebrated was what God was doing, not who was doing what. I really hope that people feel that the highlight is what the Lord is saying through the whole album versus who sang what, who did what, whose name is on what." [...] He finally said, [...] "All in all, this is what worship leaders want - solid, biblical, fresh songs that can speak to their people and have an amazing sound." ...|$|R

Dre continued by stating [...] "'Big Dreams' is a phenomenal record. It's very inspirational, It's gonna be big in the streets, but it's gonna be big all across the board. I feel like 'Hate It or Love It' was such an inspirational record that a lot of people didn't see coming. And this has the same feel as far as how it makes you feel, but it's gonna inspire the shit outta everybody.

The entire process of releasing the Rich Forever tape generated a huge amount of buzz for the album as Ross had likely planned.
