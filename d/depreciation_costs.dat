25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{rational}} depreciation method for a pyroprocess cost calculation. Toward this end, the so-called advanced decelerated depreciation method (ADDM) was developed that complements the limitations of the existing depreciation methods such as the straight-line method and fixed percentage of declining-balance method. ADDM was used to show the trend of the direct material cost and direct labor cost compared to the straight-line or fixed percentage of the declining-balance methods that are often used today. As a result, it was demonstrated that the <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> of the ADDM, which assumed a pyroprocess facility's life period to be 40 years with a deceleration rate of 5 %, takes up 4. 14 % and 27. 74 % of the pyroprocess unit cost ($ 781 /kg heavy metal) in the 1 st and final years, respectively. In other words, it was found that the ADDM can cost the pyroprocess facility's capital investment rationally every year. Finally, ADDM's validity was verified by confirming that the sum of the <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> by year, and the sum of the purchasing cost of the building and equipment, are the same...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issue of}} allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> in the dynamic inputoutput model of an industrial enterprise. Accounting the <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> in such a model improves the policy of fixed assets management. It is particularly relevant to develop the algorithm for the allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> {{in the construction of}} dynamic input-output model of an industrial enterprise, since such enterprises have a significant amount of fixed assets. Implementation of terms of the adequacy of such an algorithm itself allows: evaluating the appropriateness of investments in fixed assets, studying the final financial results of an industrial enterprise, depending on management decisions in the depreciation policy. It is necessary to note that the model in question for the enterprise is always degenerate. It is caused by the presence of zero rows in the matrix of capital expenditures by lines of structural elements unable to generate fixed assets (part of the service units, households, corporate consumers). The paper presents the algorithm for the allocation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> for the model. This algorithm was developed by the authors and served as the basis for further development of the flowchart for subsequent implementation with use of software. The construction of such algorithm and its use for dynamic input-output models of industrial enterprises is actualized by international acceptance of the effectiveness of the use of input-output models for national and regional economic systems. This is what allows us to consider that the solutions discussed in the article are of interest to economists of various industrial enterprises...|$|E

40|$|In the Tokachi District {{there has}} been an {{astonishing}} increase in the development of large-scale upland farming, especially in the peripheral areas where agricultural production capacity is lower. Recently, {{there has been}} an increase in number of upland farms that are more than 50 hectares in size. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the potential problems associated with expanding the scale of upland farms. The study examined four upland farmers in the Tokachi District. 1) The proportion of cultivated crops relative to farm size has steadily declined in the last ten years. By changing work procedures it is possible to maintain current upland farming land use patterns and the crop rotation system for farms up to 50 hectares in size. When farms reach 70 hectares in size, however, it is very difficult to maintain the crop rotation system without changing work procedures and the combination of cultivated crops. If changes are not made the farmer is forced to perform work at less than optimal times. Expanding upland farming scale to 70 hectares, without a technical foundation, will cause a decrease in land productivity. 2) Enlarging farm size while maintaining the crop rotation system requires an increase in fixed capital expenditures. This in turn raises <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs.</b> The <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> for a 70 -hectare farm are especially high and the <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs</b> per hectare cannot be reduced. In short, economies of scale do not exist in large-scale upland farming. This suggests that fixed machinery costs will not decrease with an increase in farm size. 3) Enlarging farm size, up to 50 hectares, in peripheral areas clearly increases farm income, but at 70 hectares, because of a decrease in land productivity and an increase in <b>depreciation</b> <b>costs,</b> farm income is severely restricted. At 70 hectares the efficiency of farm management decreases and both income ratio and income per acre falls...|$|E

40|$|Financial, economic, and {{biological}} {{data collected from}} cow-calf producers {{who participated in the}} Illinois and Iowa Standardized Performance Analysis (SPA) programs were used in this study. Data used were collected for the 1996 through 1999 calendar years, with each herd within year representing one observation. This resulted in a final database of 225 observations (117 from Iowa and 108 from Illinois) from commercial herds with a range in size from 20 to 373 cows. Two analyses were conducted, one utilizing financial cost of production data, the other economic cost of production data. Each observation was analyzed as the difference from the mean for that given year. The independent variable utilized in both the financial and economic models as an indicator of profit was return to unpaid labor and management per cow (RLM). Used as dependent variables were the five factors that make up total annual cow cost: feed <b>cost,</b> operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> capital charge, and hired labor, all on an annual cost per cow basis. In the economic analysis, family labor was also included. Production factors evaluated as dependent variables in both models were calf weight, calf price, cull weight, cull price, weaning percentage, and calving distribution. Herd size and investment were also analyzed. All financial factors analyzed were significantly correlated to RLM (P 3 ̆c. 10) except cull weight, and cull price. All economic factors analyzed were significantly correlated to RLM (P 3 ̆c. 10) except calf weight, cull weight and cull price. Results of the financial prediction equation indicate that there are eight measurements capable of explaining over 82 percent of the farm-to-farm variation in RLM. Feed cost is the overriding factor driving RLM in both the financial and economic stepwise regression analyses. In both analyses over 50 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in RLM could be explained by feed cost. Financial feed cost is correlated (P 3 ̆c. 001) to operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> and investment. Economic feed cost is correlated (P 3 ̆c. 001) with investment and operating cost, as well as capital charge. Operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation,</b> and capital charge were all negatively correlated (P 3 ̆c. 10) to herd size, and positively correlated (P 3 ̆c. 01) to feed cost in both analyses. Operating costs were positively correlated with capital charge and investment (P 3 ̆c. 01) in both analyses. In the financial regression model, <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> was the second critical factor explaining almost 9 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in RLM followed by operating cost (5 percent). Calf weight had a greater impact than calf price on RLM in both the financial and economic regression models. Calf weight was the fourth indicator of RLM in the financial model and was similar in magnitude to operating cost. Investment was not a significant variable in either regression model; however, it was highly correlated to a number of the significant cost variables including feed <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> and operating cost (P 3 ̆c. 001, financial; P 3 ̆c. 10, economic). Cost factors were far more influential in driving RLM than production, reproduction, or producer controlled marketing factors. Of these cost factors, feed cost had by far the largest impact. As producers focus attention on factors that affect the profitability of the operation, feed cost is the most critical control point because it was responsible for over 50 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in profit...|$|R
