40|$|Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), {{also called}} acetolactate synthase, {{is a key}} enzyme {{involved}} in {{the first step of}} the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids valine, isoleucine and leucine. Acetohydroxyacid synthase-inhibiting herbicides (AHAS herbicides) are five chemical families of herbicides that inhibit AHAS enzymes, including imidazolinones (IMI), sulfonylureas (SU), pyrimidinylthiobenzoates, triazolinones and triazolopyrimidines. Five AHAS genes have been identified in rapeseed, but little information is available regarding the role of miRNAs in response to AHAS herbicides. In this study, an AHAS <b>herbicides</b> <b>tolerant</b> genotype and a sensitive genotype were used for miRNA comparative analysis. A total of 20 small RNA libraries were obtained of these two genotypes at three time points (0 h, 24 h and 48 h) after spraying SU and IMI herbicides with two replicates. We identified 940 conserved miRNAs and 1515 novel candidate miRNAs in Brassica napus using high-throughput sequencing methods combined with computing analysis. A total of 3284 genes were predicted to be targets of these miRNAs, and their functions were shown using GO, KOG and KEGG annotations. The differentiation expression results of miRNAs showed almost twice as many differentiated miRNAs were found in tolerant genotype M 342 (309 miRNAs) after SU herbicide application than in sensitive genotype N 131 (164 miRNAs). In additiond 177 and 296 miRNAs defined as differentiated in sensitive genotype and tolerant genotype in response to SU herbicides. The miR 398 family was observed to be associated with AHAS herbicide tolerance because their expression increased in the tolerant genotype but decreased in the sensitive genotype. Moreover, 50 novel miRNAs from 39 precursors were predicted. There were 8 conserved miRNAs, 4 novel miRNAs and 3 target genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR experiment. This study not only provides novel insights into the miRNA content of AHAS <b>herbicides</b> <b>tolerant</b> rapeseed in response to AHAS herbicides, but also demonstrates that miRNAs may be involved in AHAS herbicides tolerance...|$|R

A better understanding of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of bromoxynil tolerance could lead to improved weed control programs in onions. Onion cultivar response to bromoxynil was studied under greenhouse conditions. Tolerant cultivars were identified using survival and fresh weight of surviving plants as indicator variables. Cultivars 'Utah Yellow Sweet Spanish' (YSS) and 'White Bermuda' were designated as tolerant and sensitive, respectively. Bromoxyml rates eliciting minimum and maximum responses in percent kill and fresh weight of the surviving plants were determined. Cultivar 'Winner' was identified as tolerant from the screening of cultivars with 5. 0 kg ae/ha bromoxynil. Mechanisms that confer cultivar tolerance to bromoxynil in onions were studied by examining the effects of ethofumesate, piperonyl butoxide and hydrolysis of cyano ¹⁴C bromoxynil in Utah YSS and White Bermuda. Ethofumesate did not enhance bromoxynil phytotoxicity to Utah YSS. Piperonyl butoxide did not modify bromoxynil phytotoxicity to either Utah YSS or White Bermuda. Hydrolysis of cyano ¹⁴C bromoxynil in Utah YSS and White Bermuda yielded no significant differences in the amount of unextractable radioactivity from the plant residues or in the amount of 3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile formed.

Tembotrione, 2, 4 -D, dicamba, and glufosinate applied at 1 x controlled 80 to 100 %, 98 to 100 %, 84 to 100 %, and 94 to 100 % Palmer amaranth, respectively. Differential response of Palmer amaranth populations to the test herbicides existed. The potential of selecting for resistance was highest in tembotrione, followed by dicamba. In the tank mixture test, all herbicides applied individually at 1 x rate controlled Pra-C population 99 to 100 % in the greenhouse and 91 to 100 % in the field study. In corn, the control in Pra-C, Mis-C, and STF-C populations was 33 to 54 % for tembotrione, 68 to 89 % for 2, 4 -D, and 96 to 100 % for glufosinate applied at their commercial rates. The study showed that half rates of 2, 4 -D and glufosinate can be applied, only in combination, without significantly compromising Palmer amaranth control. The majority of glufosinate + tembotrione and some glufosinate + dicamba mixtures were not compatible; glufosinate + 2, 4 -D mixtures were generally additive and in few cases, synergistic. The reduced efficacy from antagonism was overcome by mixing 1 x rates of the <b>herbicides.</b> Pra-C (<b>tolerant)</b> had 2 -folds higher tolerance than Lee-A (susceptible), with LD 50 values of 344 and 141 g ha- 1, respectively.

No entanto, os mecanismos de tolerância dessas espécies não estão completamente compreendidos, e a elucidação desses mecanismos é fundamental nas recomendações de estratégias para o {{manejo de}} plantas daninhas tolerantes ao glyphosate. Sendo assim, os objetivos desta pesquisa foram: (i) avaliar a dinâmica do banco de sementes das espécies de plantas daninhas Commelina benghalensis L., Ipomoea grandifolia (Dammer) ODon e Richardia brasiliensis Gomez (tolerantes), Amaranthus hybridus L. e Galinsoga parviflora Cav. (suscetíveis), em áreas tratadas intensivamente com doses de glyphosate por dois anos consecutivos, (ii) caracterizar os mecanismos de tolerância C. benghalensis e I. grandifolia ao herbicida glyphosate e (iii) estudar a eficácia de controle sobre as plantas daninhas tolerantes por herbicidas alternativos isolados e em mistura com glyphosate. Nos estudos de dinâmica do banco de sementes foram coletadas periodicamente amostras de solos de uma área com aplicação repetitiva do glyphosate para analise quantitativa e qualitativa através de extração das sementes e de germinação de sementes em casa-de-vegetação. Na caracterização dos mecanismos de tolerância, experimentos foram instalados para quantificar a absorção e a translocação de 14 C glyphosate pelas plantas C. benghalensis, I. grandifolia, A. hybridus e Glycine max resistente (R) e suscetível (S) ao glyphosate, às 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 e 72 horas após tratamento (HAT); analisando-se, ainda, o metabolismo do glyphosate pelas plantas daninhas a 72 HAT. Cromatografia de camada delgada foi utilizada para determinar à composição química das ceras epicuticulares e microscopia eletrônica de varredura para a caracterização da superfície foliar das plantas daninhas. Experimento em casa de vegetação com os herbicidas alternativos carfentrazone, flumioxazin, sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl e bentazon foi conduzido para testar as interações aditivas, sinergísticas ou antagônicas com glyphosate no controle de plantas daninhas tolerantes. Os resultados foram: Ao final de dois anos de aplicação repetitiva de glyphosate houve um acréscimo do banco de sementes das plantas daninhas tolerantes, e um decréscimo no banco de sementes das plantas daninhas sensíveis ao glyphosate. A taxa de absorção e translocação do 14 C glyphosate em A. hybridus e Glycine max R e S foi maior que das demais plantas estudadas; I. grandifolia apresentou excelente taxa de absorção, entretanto, a translocação desta espécie foi reduzida. Em C. benghalensis a taxa de absorção foliar do glyphosate foi baixa, porém, não houve impedimento a translocação. Em C. benghalensis foi encontrado, além de glyphosate, o metabólito ácido aminometilfosfônico (AMPA). As ceras da cutícula foliar de A. hybridus e I. grandifolia apresentaram características predominantemente hidrofílicas, e a superfície foliar não apresentou tricomas, sendo observado uma grande quantidade de estômatos. As ceras epicuticulares destas duas espécies de plantas daninhas apresentaram forma cristalina apenas em A. hybridus. Em C. benghalensis as ceras são relativamente mais hidrofóbicas, o que pode ter influenciado na menor penetração de glyphosate; sendo que, a superfície foliar apresenta tricomas e um número menor de estômatos, e estes estão recobertos por cera epicuticular. Intensive {{applications of the}} herbicide glyphosate for weed control may result in the weed population changes, through selection pressure of the glyphosate tolerant weed species. However, the glyphosate tolerance mechanisms of these species are not completely understood, and the elucidation of these mechanisms is fundamental to the recommendations of alternative <b>herbicides</b> to glyphosate <b>tolerant</b> weed management. Therefore, the objectives of this research were: (i) to evaluate the weed seed bank dynamic of the species Commelina benghalensis L., Ipomoea grandifolia (Dammer) ODon and Richardia brasiliensis Gomez (tolerants to glyphosate), Amaranthus hybridus L. and Galinsoga parviflora Cav. (susceptibles to glyphosate), in areas that had been intensively treated with glyphosate rates for two consecutive years; (ii) to characterize the glyphosate tolerance mechanisms of C. benghalensis and I. grandifolia, and (iii) to study the efficacy of alternative herbicides in mixture with glyphosate in the control of tolerant weeds. The weed seed bank dynamic was evaluated through soil samples collected periodically, and analysed quantitative and qualitativelly by greenhouse germination test and seeds counting. Experiments were conducted to caracterize the absorption and translocation of 14 C glyphosate by C. benghalensis, I. grandifolia, A. hybridus and Glycine max resistant (R) and susceptible (S) to glyphosate, at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment (HAT); and analysing the glyphosate metabolism by the weeds at 72 HAT. Thin layer chromatography {{was used to determine}} the chemical composition of the epicuticular layers and eletronic microscopy to caracterize the foliar surface of the weeds. Greenhouse experiment with the alternative herbicides carfentrazone, flumioxazin, sulfentrazone, chlorimuron-ethyl and bentazon were conducted to test aditive, sinergistic or antagonic interactions with glyphosate on the control of the tolerant weeds. After two years of repetitive glyphosate application there was an increase in the weed seed bank of the tolerant species, and a decrease of the weed seed bank of the susceptible species to glyphosate. The rate of absorption and translocation of the 14 C glyphosate by A. hybridus and Glycine max R and S was higher than the other studied plants, likewise I. grandifolia presented an excelent rate of absorption, even tough, the translocation of this species was reduced. In C. benghalensis the glyphosate rate of foliar absorption was low, however, there was a free translocation of the herbicide. No glyphosate metabolites were observed in I. grandifolia and A. hybridus, however, in C. benghalensis it was found, besides glyphosate, the aminophosphonic acid (AMPA) metabolite. The cuticle waxes of A. hybridus and I. grandifolia presented predominantly hydrophilic characteristics, and the foliar surface did not present tricomes, being observed a great amount of stomata. The epicuticular waxes of this two weed species presented crystal form only in A. hybridus.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} is an innate characteristic of crop plants. It {{enables them to}} survive and propagate even {{in the presence of}} lethal doses of herbicides in the surroundings. Genetic tolerance in crops towards herbicides may have several benefits. It may increases safety margins between weed and crop sensitivity and also expands applicability of a particular herbicide. Besides, it can also lower the operating cost for weed control as compared to manual weeding and crop rotation which is normally prohibited by herbicide persistence. Herbicide resistant crops are developed through transformation of a plant with either native or mutant resistant genes, seed mutagenesis, plant cell or tissue culture and through other traditional plant breeding techniques. Seed mutagenesis is a non-transgenic approach, which is found to be most economical and perfect approach.

Dewar, et al, 'A novel {{approach}} {{to the use of}} genetically modified <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> crops for environmental benefit', Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences, Vol. 270 (1513) : 335 - 340, February 2003, doi: 10. 1098 /rspb. 2002. 2248. ?? 2003 The Royal Society. The proposed introduction of genetically modified <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> (GMHT) crops, with claims of improved weed control, has prompted fears about possible environmental impacts of their widespread adoption, particularly on arable weeds, insects and associated farmland birds. In response to this, we have developed a novel weed???management system for GMHT sugar beet, based on band spraying, which exploits the flexibility offered by the broad???spectrum partner herbicides. Here, we show the results from two series of field experiments which, taken together, demonstrate that, by using this system, crops can be managed for enhanced weed and insect biomass without compromising yield, thus potentially offering food and shelter to farmland birds and other wildlife. These results could be applicable widely to other row crops, and indicate that creative use of GMHT technology could be a powerful tool for developing more sustainable farming systems in the future...|$|E
30|$|When Raybould {{reflected}} on the UK farm scale evaluation of GM <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> (GMHT) crops, he illustrated clearly that the problem formulation (step 1) strongly depends on the respective stakeholder interests [52]. 6 From a herbicide-producing company's perspective, the preservation of arable weeds presents no value and the aim of any GMHT crop system is to reduce their abundance; from a nature conservation perspective, however, arable weeds are a valuable part of biodiversity {{that should not be}} eradicated in agro-ecosystems.|$|E

This article evaluates the potential welfare effects of adopting genetically modified crops in Russia, focusing on the potential benefits to Russian producers who adopt <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> corn and soybeans. Calculations are based on supply and demand functions of current market situations and their potential shifts. The results quantify the potential monetary gains from open markets to genetic engineering technology and explain the potential additional costs related to technology adoption...|$|E

However, glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium, as used in GM <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> crops, offer the opportunity to control large weeds and weed control can be timed according to the agronomic and environmental aims of the user. This paper will use sugar beet as a model crop and report results where different approaches to weed control have been used and discuss their relevance in the wider agricultural and environmental contex...|$|E
30|$|Of {{the various}} herbicides, imidazolinones {{are the most}} widely {{targeted}} ones for developing <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> crops through non-GM approach. Imidazolinones act by disrupting Acetolactate Synthase (ALS), and/or Acetohydroxy Acid Synthase (AHAS), enzymes involved in branched chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isolecine) biosynthesis (Singh and Shaner, 1995). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of AHAS and mutations causing tolerance against imidazolinones are well characterized in Arabidopsis (Sathasivan et al. 1990 and 1991). Mutations in AHAS gene is reported to confer resistance to five groups of herbicides, namely, imidazolinones (Shaner et al. 1984), sulfonylurea (Chaleff and Mauvais, 1984), pyrimidinyl thiobenzoates (Stidham, 1991), triazolopyrimidine and sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones (Gerwick et al. 1990). Although ALS/AHAS mutants tolerant to imidazolinone compounds have been developed in rice, wheat, sunflower, canola and maize (Tan et al. 2005), they are all protected by patents (Croughan 1998, 2002; Livore 2003; Livore et al. 2011). The present investigation was therefore undertaken {{with the objective of}} identifying novel Imazethapyr resistant rice lines through Ethyl Methane Sulphonate (EMS) induced mutagenesis which can be used without restriction in public funded rice breeding. We report here the identification and detailed characterization of one such stable <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> mutant in rice {{for the first time in}} India.|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} production of <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> (HT) canola began in Western Canada in 1997. With {{more than a}} decade of use, the actual farm-level environmental impact of HT canola can be evaluated. This article reports on a spring 2007 survey of nearly 600 canola farmers in the three prairie provinces of Western Canada. Producers were asked about their crop production experiences for 2005 and 2006 and expected crop planting for 2007. A reduction in the total number of chemical applications over the 3 -year period was reported, resulting in a decrease of herbicide active ingredient being applied to farmland in Western Canada of nearly 1. 3 million kg annually. Fewer tillage passes over the survey period were reported, improving moisture conservation, decreasing soil erosion and contributing to carbon sequestration in annual cropland. An estimated 1 million tonnes of carbon is either sequestered or no longer released under land management facilitated by HT canola production, as compared to 1995. The value of this carbon off-set is estimated to be C$ 5 million. Comparisons with similar studies and against non-adoption of HT canola can guide future decisions about HT canola adoption.
