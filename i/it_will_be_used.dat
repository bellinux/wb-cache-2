5|$|Beryllium is {{also used}} at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion {{research}} laboratory, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride {{is one of the}} constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E

5|$|Runway 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary runway, is {{long enough to be}} able to receive the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

Without insulin, glucose {{is unable}} to enter the cells where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for this and other {{anabolic}} ("building up") purposes, such as the synthesis of glycogen, proteins, and fatty acids. Insulin is also an active preventor of the breakdown or catabolism of glycogen and fat. The absence of sufficient insulin causes this breaking-down process to be accelerated; it is the mechanism behind metabolizing fat instead of glucose {{and the appearance of}} ketones.|$|E
