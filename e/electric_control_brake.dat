40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the coordination of optimal reclosing and fuzzy logic-controlled braking resistor on the transient stability of a multimachine power system in case of an unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers. The transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor is compared to that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations in case of a nine-bus power system model as well as a ten-machine system. Simulation results of both balanced and unbalanced faults at different points in the power systems show that the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor is able to stabilize the systems well in case of an unsuccessful reclosing. Moreover, the transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal reclosing and fuzzy <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor is better than that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor...|$|R

40|$|Slip control’ braking {{has been}} shown to reduce the {{emergency}} stopping distance of an experimental heavy goods vehicle by up to 19 %, compared to conventional electronic/anti-lock braking systems (EBS). However, little regard has been given to the impact of slip <b>control</b> <b>braking</b> on the vehicle’s directional dynamics. This paper uses validated computer models to show that slip control could severely degrade directional performance during emergency braking. A modified slip control strategy, ‘attenuated slip demand’ (ASD) control, is proposed in order to rectify this. Results from simulations of vehicle performance are presented for combined braking and cornering manoeuvres with EBS and slip <b>control</b> <b>braking</b> with and without ASD control. The ASD controller enables slip <b>control</b> <b>braking</b> to provide directional performance comparable with conventional EBS while maintaining a substantial stopping distance advantage. The controller is easily tuned to work across a wide range of different operating conditions.

The effects of the fault occurring time on turbine shaft torsional torques have also been investigated. Simulations are performed by using EMTP (Electro-Magnetic Transients Program). Through the simulation results of various multi-phase faults in a single machine connected to an infinite bus system, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy logic <b>controlled</b> <b>braking</b> resistor in damping shaft torsional oscillations is demonstrated...|$|R
