25|$|Such cosmological {{solutions}} of the gravitation-equations (with not vanishing A-constant) {{have been}} found by Mr. Gödel. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to weigh whether these {{are not to be}} excluded on physical grounds.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases {{this may not be the}} case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

He added that, [...] "hile Bow Wow's more mature stance suits him well, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> {{to see how}} his younger fans and mainstream R radio react to the teenage MC's new image. Either way, Bow Wow has proven that his act is no child's play." [...] Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews was also positive towards the song saying, [...] "Annoying bird calls aside, it is a catchy song about Bow Wow trying to catch a little punani." ...|$|E

500|$|After its publication, The Immortals of Meluha {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from critics for its concept but the prose received mixed reviews. Pradip Bhattacharya from The Statesman {{felt that the}} [...] "plot skips along at a brisk pace, the characters are well etched and the reader’s attention {{is not allowed to}} flag. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see how the trilogy progresses.

[...] Another review by Gaurav Vasudev from the same newspaper wrote that [...] "the book is a gripping mythological story written in modern style." ...|$|E
500|$|David Blackwell of the American review site Enterline Media said, [...] "MI-5 really {{impressed}} {{me with the}} first two seasons. The third season does start {{out for the first}} three episodes before it reaches some highs and lows until it stabilizes with the last two episodes of season 3." [...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)." [...] Blackwell concluded by saying [...] "sometime MI-5 fails as a show this season, but it still reaches levels of greatness. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see what they have in store for season 4." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2013, {{one week}} after the U.S. Supreme Court issued rulings in two cases that were widely {{interpreted}} as favoring recognition of same-sex marriages, Card wrote in Entertainment Weekly that the gay marriage issue is moot due to the Supreme Court's decision on DOMA.

2500|$|Zawisa gave issue #7 four stars, {{praising the}} work of artist Stephanie Hans, writing, [...] "Fearless Defenders #7 takes what could, and maybe should, have been a {{breather}} issue for the characters and readers and emotionally amplifies it.

[...] Corey Schroeder [...] of Comic Vine gave it five stars writing, [...] "Without going into TOO much detail, I will say that I love that this issue brings back a trope from old Thor comics and applies it to Valkyrie in a way that is far more interesting than even the original was." [...] Grey gave it a 9.3, writing, [...] "There's an energy to the book's visuals that is equal parts elegant and exciting. Bunn and Hans make for a hell of a team and issue #7 proves to be one of the series' best yet." ...|$|E

30|$|As the {{employment}} of FCM enhances the performance of EWT technique for the mental task classification, {{it would be better}} to explore some other fuzzy-based clustering which has been explored in image segmentation [46]. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to explore whether the FEWT would work in other type of BCI such as motor imagery and multi-mental task classification.|$|R

60|$|It is {{a curious}} thing that while most {{organised}} religions seem to drape about and conceal and smother the statement of the true God, the honest Atheist, with his passionate impulse to strip the truth bare, is constantly and unwittingly reproducing the divine likeness. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> here {{to call a witness}} or so to the extreme instability of absolute negation.|$|E
