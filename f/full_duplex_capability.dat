40|$|Abstractâ€”With recent {{advances}} in wireless systems, wireless in-band full duplex is proven possible. Prior work primarily allows a full duplex receiver to either send back a packet (bidirectional mode) or to forward another packet to its neighbor (secondary transmission). In our work, we look beyond a node pair and explore how a network can best utilize the <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> <b>capability.</b> When a full duplex receiver {{does not have any}} packets to send back, concurrent transmissions (exposed transmissions) can be initiated. In a distributed channel access protocol, rapid signaling is crucial to identify the best mode for a given pair of transmitter and receiver, and to inform potential exposed terminals of transmission opportunities. In this paper, we present, RCTC, a fast and low overhead signaling mechanism based on Pseudo-random Noise (PN) sequences to enable multimodal operation of wireless links in a distributed channel access setting to support concurrent transmissions in the neighborhood. Our prototype with USRPs shows up to 78 % throughput gain. Extensive simulations over larger networks show a throughput gain of up to 131 % for RCTC over the native full duplex scheme and up to 111 % over a scheme that enables secondary transmission.

We consider the scenario, {{where one of the}} receivers has a secrecy constraint and its packets need to be kept secret from the other receiver. This is achieved by employing full-duplexing at the receiver with the secrecy constraint, so that it transmits a jamming signal to impede the reception of the other receiver. In this context, the stability region of the two-user BC is characterized for the general decoding case. Then, assuming two different decoding schemes the respective stability regions are derived. The effect of self-interference due to the full-duplex operation on the stability region is also investigated. The stability region of the BC with a secrecy constraint, where the receivers do not have <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> <b>capability</b> can be obtained as a special case of the results derived in this paper.

Phase stability measurements of ground facilities in various loop-around schemes using a satellite simulator have been performed in order to determine ultimate stability limits. Allan-variance stability plots are generated for sample times of 1 s to several days at various carrier-to-noise density (C/No) ratios.

40|$|The {{comparison}} between the performance of both wired and wireless networks is based on various performance parameters. The performance of the wired Ethernet is very sensitive {{to the number of}} users and the offered load. When the number of users/offered load is high then the collisions increase resulting in larger wastage of the medium and lowering overall throughput. The aim of this research is to compare the throughput of LANs using Ethernet and WiFi under three different scenarios: 25, 50 and 100 users using simulator OPNET-MODELER. By analyzing the graphs, it is concluded that throughput of Wireless LAN (WiFi) is greater than that of Ethernet with operating at transmission speed of 10 Mbps when sufficient number of users are deployed that the model can support. When the number of users is increased beyond the certain limit, throughput decreases. The throughput of Ethernet and WiFi keeps on increasing and decreasing within some specific range due to the propagation delay and overhead collisions affecting at that time. The throughput is usually measured in bits per second (bit/s or bps) or in data packets per second or data packets per time slot. II.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} hardware-software {{intercommunication}} in a reconfigurable {{system has been}} investigated based on a framework for run time reconfiguration. The goal has been to develop a fast and flexible link between applications running on an embedded processor and reconfigurable accelerator hardware in form of a Xilinx Virtex device. As a start the link was broken down into hardware and software components based on constraints from earlier work and a general literature search. A register architecture for reconfigurable modules, a reconfigurable interface and a backend bridge linking reconfigurable hardware with the system bus were identified as the main hardware components whereas device drivers and a hardware operating system were identified as software components. These components were developed in a bottom-up approach, then deployed, tested and evaluated. Synthesis and simulation results from this thesis suggest that a hybrid register architecture, a mix of shift based and addressable register architecture {{might be a good}} solution for a reconfigurable module. Such an architecture enables a reconfigurable interface with <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> <b>capability</b> with an initially small area overhead compared to a full scale RAM implementation. Although the hybrid architecture might not be very suitable for all types of reconfigurable modules it can be a nice compromise when attempting to achieve a uniform reconfigurable interface. Backend bridge solutions were developed assuming the above hybrid reconfigurable interface. Three main types were researched: a software register backend, a data cache backend and an instruction and data cache backend. Performance evaluation shows that the instruction and data cache outperforms the other two with an average acceleration ratio of roughly 5 - 10. Surprisingly the data cache backend performs worst of all due to latency ratios and design choices. Aside from the BRAM component required for the cache backends, resource consumption was shown to be only marginally larger than a traditional software register solution. Caching using a controller in the backend-bridge can thus provide good speedup for little cost as far as BRAM resources are not scarce. A software-to-hardware interface has been created has been created through Linux character device driver and a hardware operating system daemon. While the device drivers provide a middleware layer for hardware access the HWOS separates applications from system management through a message queue interface. Performance testing shows a large increase in delay when involving the Linux device drivers and the HWOS as compared to calls directly from the kernel. Although this is natural, the software components are very important when providing a high performance platform. As additional work specialized cell handling for reconfigurable modules has been addressed {{in the context of a}} MPEG- 4 decoder. Some light has also been shed on design of reconfigurable modules in Xilinx ISE which can radically improve development time and decrease complexity compared to a Xilinx Platform Studio flow.

Also broken functionality has been shown when applying run time reconfiguration to synchronous designs using the framework for self reconfiguration...|$|E

For improving the performance a communication network, system deficiencies such as transmitter and receiver impairments need to be removed or compensated. One way to improve the network efficiency is to employ <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology. <b>Full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology doubles the network capacity compared to the case when typical frequency division duplexing (FDD) or time division duplexing (TDD) are employed in a transceiver design. Although <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> (FD) technology has enhanced the performance of the radio communication devices, the main challenge in <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> communication is the leaking self-interference signal from the transmitter to the receiver. Different methods are employed to suppress the self-interference signal in digital and analog domains which are categorized as passive or active cancellations. These techniques are discussed in this thesis in order to understand from which point in the propagation path, the required signal for cancellation can be taken and how those techniques are employed in digital and analog domains. For having a good self-interference cancellation (SIC) both analog and digital cancellation techniques are needed since typical digital suppression method is low complex and somewhat limited. In this thesis, first we start with discussing about the <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology and the reason why it has become popular in recent years and later <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> deficiencies are examined.
