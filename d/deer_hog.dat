25|$|With the {{guidance}} {{provided by the}} CZA, kraals—fencing of {{a portion of the}} moated enclosure—were created in the herbivore enclosures in 2003 in order to isolate and treat sick or wounded animal. Herbivores with physical problems are isolated in the facility to be checked by the vets. One of the corners of the enclosure is chosen mainly to keep visitors away from the treated animals. Kraals have been created in the enclosures of spotted deer, blackbuck, sambar, nilghai, barking <b>deer,</b> <b>hog</b> deer, brow-antlered deer, moufflon and bison. To make the animals get accustomed to the kraal, the feed is kept inside the premises. Apart from treating animals, the kraal also acts as a place for isolating animals in rut. For example, during mating season, males often fight with each other leading to problems for the veterinarians. To overcome this, the males are kept in kraals in isolation from other males. Kraals also help research scholars in observing and recording the movement and other activities of the animal, thus helping with studying their behavioural pattern.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{separate}} but similar island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> species: The Bawean deer (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry {{tropical deciduous forest}} environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> also have unspotted fawn. The two island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> may be remnants of a widespread population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> {{that at one time}} were connected to the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis porcinus): <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> has a {{much wider}} {{distribution}} than chital and covers the area throughout the alluvial grassland of northern India, extending eastward to southern Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indo-China, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1998). In Nepal, <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> are mainly concentrated in Chitwan, Karnali-Bardia and Sukla Phantas (Mishra 1982). Antlers consist of long bony pedicels with a short brow tine and a straight beam with a fork at the top (Prater 1998 and Mishra 1982). Fawning occurred from January to April in Chitwan (Dhungel and OGara 1991). Mishra and Wemmer (1987) found that the fawning season starts in February and increases until May. Tall grasses along the riverbanks, open phantas are favoured habitats. They are generally solitary but sometimes-small groups may graze together. During the hot {{hours of the day}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> shelter in tall grass and they feed {{early in the morning and}} in the evening (Dhungel and OGara 1991).|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to study population characteristics of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> released into the wild, namely: density,age structure, sex ratio, recruitment rate, threats to <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> carrying capacity and inter-specific relationships, as well as toassess the population viability over time. In this study, direct observation was used to study the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> population characteristics,and population density was estimated from the pellet-group count method. Vortex program was used to analyze thepopulation viability. Results showed that the population density of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> at Thung Ka Mung (TKM) in Phu Khieo WildlifeSanctuary (PKWS) was 2. 03 - 2. 04 individuals/hectare (SD = 1. 25). The population structure showed that the average herd sizewas 9. 57 individuals. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM preferred to stay with a group (91. 5 %), rather than being solitary (8. 5 %). The sex ratiofor males to females was 54. 64 : 100, and for females to fawns was 100 : 26. 18. The annual recruitment rate was 16. 98 %. Theirpredators were Asian wild dogs, Burmese pythons, Asiatic jackals, leopard cats and clouded leopards. The mortality rate ofthe existing <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM during the study period was 18. 1 %. The habitat sharing by camera traps revealed 4 ungulatespecies. They were sambar deer, barking deer, wild boar, and elephant, and their relative abundance were 28. 41 %, 7. 38 %, 4. 70 %, and 2. 01 % respectively. Fifty-year simulation modeling using population viability analysis indicated the sustainabilityof this population. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> population in the simulations did not exhibit sensitivity to an increase or decrease in carryingcapacity. Habitat management should be carried out continuously in TKM area, which is the main habitat for <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> inPKWS...|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{numerous}} wild boars also sambar <b>deer,</b> red muntjac, <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> and herds of chital inhabit the park. Four-horned antelopes reside predominantly in the hills.

Apart from that the striped hyena, leopard cat, wild cat, fishing cat, languor, monkey, and flying squirrel can also be sighted in VTR. The tiger's population in the Reserve was 10 in 2010, which increased to 22 in 2013.

50|$|Mammals: The park is rich {{in large}} herbivores {{including}} Indian rhinoceros, gaur, Asian elephant, sloth bear, chital, and sambar deer. Small herbivores include barking <b>deer,</b> <b>hog</b> deer and wild boar. There is a comparative lack of large carnivores, with the only big cat being the leopard. The park is not home to any resident population of Bengal tigers, Indian wild dogs, or Indian wolves. Tigers are, however, occasionally spotted here. It does have numerous small carnivores including various civets, mongooses and small cats. The park has a large resident population of wild boar, but the critically endangered pygmy hog has been reported from the park. It also has numerous rodents, including giant squirrels. The rare hispid hare has also been reported from the park.|$|E
50|$|Hyelaphus (Golden <b>deer</b> or <b>Hog</b> <b>deer)</b> is a genus of {{relatively}} small South and Southeast Asia deer that are overall brown. The three species are all threatened, {{and two of}} the species are restricted to a few small islands. Originally considered a subgenus of Axis, genetic evidence indicates that Hyelaphus is closer to the genus Rusa than Axis. Consequently, Hyelaphus was elevated to genus status, leaving the chital as the only member of Axis.|$|R
50|$|Australia has six {{introduced}} species of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from acclimatisation society releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow deer, red <b>deer,</b> sambar, <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> rusa, and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in deer farms {{by the late}} 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.|$|R
