5000|$|In 1988, unhappy {{at what he}} {{deemed to}} be a {{national}} decline in educational standards, Sugden left the profession and returned to Hull to concentrate upon full-time research and writing. It was at this time that his brother, John, suggested he tackle a subject that had interested him since his schooldays: the unsolved 'Jack the Ripper' murders of 1888. His book The Complete History of Jack the Ripper was completed after nine years of research and was first published in 1994. Sugden was the first professional historian to work on the case. He and his brother had long since largely forsaken the writing of history based principally upon the published work of others. Such work, they feared, predisposed the historian to follow paths ordained by predecessors. Rather, the Sugden brothers saw the detailed search for as many primary sources as were recoverable; their subjection to an original, careful and open-minded scrutiny; and a fair setting out of the conclusions as the best foundation for History. As John Sugden remarked, in his preface to 'Amy's Last Flight' (p. 4), his brother's [...] "trademarks" [...] were [...] "the patient collection of relevant evidence, the even-handed and fearless evaluation of primary sources, and an inherent sympathy for those who had lived in other times and circumstances." [...] Although Philip Sugden respected some of those who had written about Jack the Ripper, he was scathing about the amount of fraudulent and slipshod writing. In an essay for Camille Wolff's 'Who Was Jack the Ripper?' (p. 81) he remarked: [...] "I'm afraid that I have no patience with the bogus Ripperology that has disgraced true crime writing in recent years. The formula has unfortunately become all too familiar. First choose who you want Jack the Ripper to be. Then plunder the books, the newspapers, and, if the budget will stretch to it, the Ripper files at the Public Record Office, for facts which can be bullied into investing your fantasy with a veneer of plausibility. If you can't find anything, no matter - invent it. I'm not saying that there aren't plenty of people out there, specialists and laymen, with a genuine interest in the Ripper case. Of course there are. And it was specifically for them that I wrote my Complete History." [...] Sugden's book did not set out to name Jack the Ripper, but to painstakingly reconstruct the crimes {{within the context of the}} London of 1888, and to establish as accurate a record as possible. Only with such a foundation was it possible to measure the various suspects, and in his book he found insufficient evidence to accuse any of those named by the police or subsequent enquirers. The strongest case, he believed, could be made against the Polish-born George Chapman, but he emphasized that even that was highly circumstantial. It was this diligent sifting of evidence, <b>impartial</b> <b>evaluation</b> and honest reasoning that characterized 'The Complete History'. Sugden did not rule out the possibility that additional evidence might one day come to light to challenge his conclusions, but he insisted that such evidence be fully and scrupulously tested. The book received both critical and popular success. It was shortlisted for the Anthony Award in the United States, and at the time of Sugden's death had gone through two revised editions and an Italian translation, and sold about 140,000 copies. It was widely acknowledged to have set new standards in the historiography of the case.|$|E

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to {{rationalize}} how peer review, as the current grassroots of science, can work based on voluntary contributions of reviewers. There is no rationale to write <b>impartial</b> and thorough <b>evaluations.</b> Consequently, there is no risk in submitting low-quality work by authors. As a result, scientists face a social dilemma: if everyone acts according to his or her own self-interest, low scientific quality is produced. Still, in practice, reviewers as well as authors invest high effort in reviews and submissions. We examine how the increased relevance of public good benefits (journal impact factor), the editorial policy of handling incoming reviews, and the acceptance decisions that take into account reputational information can help the evolution of high-quality contributions from authors. High effort from the side of reviewers is problematic even if authors cooperate: reviewers are still best off by producing low-quality reviews, which does not hinder scientific development, just adds random noise and unnecessary costs to it. We show with agent-based simulations that tacit agreements between authors that are based on reciprocity might decrease these costs, but does not result in superior scientific quality. Our study underlines why certain self-emerged current practices, such as the increased importance of journal metrics, the reputation-based selection of reviewers, and the reputation bias in acceptance work efficiently for scientific development.

The deception and the apparent lack of debriefing were also not justifiable." [...] Other authors concur claiming the orphan experiment was not within the ethical boundaries of acceptable research. Others, however, felt that the ethical standards in 1939 were different from those used today. Some felt the study was poorly designed and executed by Tudor, and as a result the data offered no proof of Johnson's subsequent hypothesis that [...] "stuttering begins, not in the child's mouth but in the parent's ear" [...] -- i.e., that it is the well-meaning parent's effort to help the child avoid what the parent has labeled [...] "stuttering" [...] (but is in fact within the range of normal speech) that contributes to what ultimately becomes the problem diagnosed as stuttering.|$|R

To achieve this, we need effective translation quality assurance (TQA) tools. A survey of the major currently available TQA tools has learnt us that TQA misses such an instrument. Many tools offer a quality control feature that automatically checks whether all the terms in the translation project match those in a pre-set terminology database. What most TQA tools have not offered yet is the functionality to run TQA processes beyond technical, consistency and metrics checking. A comparison of the characteristics and limitations of the major TQAs will show that terminology consistency and formal checking still remain the main features in present-day TQA tools. This paper's goal is to present a different TQA instrument, which is expected to tackle most of the limitations in computer assisted TQA, by blending the mere technical checks of every TQA with the translator's expertise and skilfulness in evaluating translations.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} uses and misuses in the {{application}} of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system in the European Union. It examines the main quantitative results of this extradition system achieved between 2005 and 2011 {{on the basis of the}} existing statistical knowledge on its implementation at EU official levels. The EAW has been anchored in a high level of ‘mutual trust’ between the participating states’ criminal justice regimes and authorities. This reciprocal confidence, however, has been subject to an increasing number of challenges resulting from its practical application, presenting a dual conundrum: 1. Principle of proportionality: Who are the competent judicial authorities cooperating with each other and ensuring that there are sufficient impartial controls over the necessity and proportionality of the decisions on the issuing and execution of EAWs? 2. Principle of division of powers: How can criminal justice authorities be expected to handle different criminal judicial traditions in what is supposed to constitute a ‘serious’ or ‘minor’ crime in their respective legal settings and ‘who’ is ultimately to determine (divorced from political considerations) when is it duly justified to make the EAW system operational? It is argued that the next generation of the EU’s criminal justice cooperation and the EAW need to recognise and acknowledge that the mutual trust premise upon which the European system has been built so far is no longer viable without devising new EU policy stakeholders’ structures and evaluation mechanisms. These should allow for the recalibration of mutual trust and mistrust in EU justice systems in light of the experiences of the criminal justice actors and practitioners having a stake in putting the EAW into daily effect. Such a ‘bottom-up approach’ should be backed up with the best <b>impartial</b> and objective <b>evaluation,</b> an improved system of statistical collection and an independent qualitative assessment of its implementation. This should be placed as the central axis of a renewed EAW framework which should seek to better ensure the accountability, impartial (EU-led) scrutiny and transparency of member states’ application of the EAW in light of the general principles and fundamental rights constituting the foundations of the European system of criminal justice cooperation...|$|R
40|$|The {{statement}} of software crisis in 1968 increased {{the necessity for}} system analysis and strategic planning and {{was the beginning of}} the era of software methodologies. From all the beginning data modeling was strictly separated from process modeling. Although, human thinking is flexible and, when observing system, regularly switch from data to process and back again. There is no reason why an artificial distinction between entity and function should be drawn. The natural step forward was to unify different approaches in system modeling and therefore at the middle 80 s the object-oriented approach was elaborated in software development process, which essentially improved the limitations of approaches used before. The fact, that the strategy of software development means still progresses, even the new products in the area are produced, renders the evaluation of the means required. The evaluation of software development means may become in two ways: either by comparison of means or by examination of the requirements, which are not satisfied or which appearance is possible in the future. Analysis of existing software development means reveals the absence of the uniform methodology, which insure all the necessary techniques for effective software development. That is why it is still essentially to formalize the comparison and classification, which would provide <b>impartial</b> and precise <b>evaluation</b> of compared software develpment means for the appropriate mean selection. One more reason for the formalization of comparison is the limitations of the same existing researches in comparison of different paradigms for software develpmnt issues, the approach could be data-oriented, object-oriented or have another orientation. The formalized methodology provided in the paper is a defined and systematic process, which uses modeling and scientific classification methods as a tool in comparing software development means. The models of compared means are developed to highlight their components into defined framework. Then these models are used to compare models parts, which execute the same or similar functions and/or have the same or similar structure. The methodology defers from any analogical research due to ability to compare different issues involved in software development. It is applied for comparison of analysis methods, design strategies, notation languages, development processes and system modeling tools to show methodology's universality. It is possible to imagine that the methodology can be applied also for the comparison of programming languages, product versions, testing approaches and another software development means. The main task is to define the framework into which the components of comparable units could be projected.

In his probe to introduce the most reliable method of assessment, Waddington (2003) applied methods A, B, C, and D for scoring Spanish-English translations {{and concluded that the}} two error analysis methods A and B are equally reliable and more reliable than holistic method C. However, method D which is the combination of methods B and C in a proportion of 70 / 30 is the most reliable method. Unlike Waddington, Garant (2009) during a case study reported the general trend toward holistic method as a significant finding. In line with Waddington, Zamani Delshad (2012) concluded that the error analysis method was more accurate and reliable than the holistic one; she made comparison between error analysis and holistic approaches in translation quality assessment of journalistic texts from English into Persian. Further, she reported the holistic method as more practical which needed lesser time than error analysis to be applied. Bahameed (2014) applied Hurtado’s method of evaluation (which is based on error analysis) on female translators and supported the reliability and efficiency of the error analysis method. The method was applied to the correction of 43 female students’ translations of the final exam containing different texts to be translated in both directions between English and Arabic. The method was found out to be reasonable to give <b>impartial</b> translation quality <b>evaluation</b> for the students’ translations. Unlike Bahameed (2014), Phelan (2017) examined one of the analytic methods and reported some demerits of it. Phelan (2017) during a case study applied the American Translators Association framework (ATA) to assessment of legal translations; ten raters scored the translations based on the framework. Raters’ feedback indicated that some error categories overlapped or were vague and the flowchart was difficult to implement, in particular when deciding the level of seriousness of errors. She concluded that at first sight, the ATA framework gave the impression of being an analytical approach with very little possibility of subjectivity {{on the part of the}} assessors, but it turned out to be quite subjective when implemented. Waddington (2001) sent out a questionnaire to 48 European and Canadian universities to examine the degree of application of various methods of TQA by teachers. A total of 52 teachers replied from 20 of these universities; the result was as follow: 36.5 % of the teachers used a method based on error analysis, 38.5 % used a holistic method, and 23 % used a combined error analysis with a holistic appreciation. Based on his study, holistic methods are more common than the other types.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{growth of}} {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) {{has been one}} of the most significant developments in the U. S. workplace in the past twenty-five years. There is a significant and growing body of research tracking the development of ADR in U. S. employment relations, its effects on organizations and workers, and its implications for the community of neutrals and the providers of neutral services (Lipsky, Seeber, and Fincher 2003; Seeber and Lipsky 2006; Bingham and Chachere 1999; Bingham 2004; Colvin et al. 2006; Lewin 2004). The intense debates that have arisen over the desirability of ADR have caused both practitioners and researchers to recognize the need for the evaluation of all types of ADR programs, including those mandated by the courts, statutes, and other public policies and those established by private sector organizations (Seeber, Schmidle, and Smith 2001; Lipsky and Seeber 2006; Bingham 2004). The authors of this paper have conducted numerous evaluations of ADR programs in both the public and private sectors, and it has been our experience that the desire of the evaluators and the program sponsors to have an <b>impartial</b> and objective <b>evaluation</b> of a program has often been frustrated by political considerations. This paper will focus on the politics of the evaluation of ADR systems and programs. We maintain that there are three types of political factors affecting ADR programs: One type involves ideological and policy debates about the desirability of ADR; a second type involves political factors within an organization (whether private or public) that affect the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of an ADR program; and the third type is the political struggle that can sometimes emerge between the managers and practitioners who sponsor ADR programs and the academics and consultants who evaluate them. Here we concentrate particularly on the differences that arise between program sponsors and outside evaluators. Academic evaluators, for example, value the so-called purity of their research and strive to conduct evaluations consistent with accepted social science standards; program sponsors and administrators have evaluation objectives that are much more instrumental and pragmatic. All parties in an evaluation may very well have legitimate objectives, but political differences can arise out of the incompatibility of those objectives, an incompatibility that is often the consequence of the 2 ̆ 2 clash of cultures 2 ̆ 2 between academics and practitioners. In our view, political factors will invariably influence program evaluation. It is clear that some of the political differences that affect the evaluation of ADR programs (for example, ideological debates) are beyond the control of either the program sponsors and administrators or the evaluators. But there are other political factors that the parties can potentially manage, or at least influence. On the one hand, political differences can threaten the integrity of an evaluation. On the other hand, not all political factors have negative consequences for an evaluation. The trick for sponsors and evaluators alike is, first, to recognize the political factors they can control and, second, to distinguish between those that have positive effects on the evaluation and those that have negative effects...|$|R
40|$|An {{ongoing debate}} over the impacts of {{protected}} areas on rural communities in central Africa has become increasingly polarized in recent years, even as definitions of displacement have shifted from outright expulsion to economic dislocation precipitated by lost access to natural resources. Although forcible removal of communities {{to make way for}} the creation of National Parks has certainly occurred in the past in some parts of the world, we contend that not a single individual has been physically removed from any of the protected areas created in central Africa over the past decade, despite claims to the contrary of hundreds of thousands of "conservation refugees. " Furthermore, we recognize that a scarcity of data precludes <b>impartial</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the potential impacts of economic displacement of local communities living adjacent to protected areas, and we call for a concerted effort by conservationists and the social scientists who criticize conservation efforts, in order to measure the effects of protected areas on livelihoods, and to work towards a more socially responsible conservation paradigm...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the status of field and geochronology studies of the Lathrop Wells volcanic center. Our perspective is that it is critical to assess all possible methods for obtaining cross-checking data to resolve chronology and field problems. It is equally important to consider application of the range of chronology methods available in Quaternary geologic research. Such an approach seeks to increase the confidence in data interpretations through obtaining convergence among separate isotopic, radiogenic, and age-correlated methods. Finally, the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of each dating method need to be carefully described to facilitate an <b>impartial</b> <b>evaluation</b> of results. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes the status of continuing field studies for the volcanic center for this area south of Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The second part presents an overview of the preliminary results of ongoing chronology studies and their constraints on the age and stratigraphy of the Lathrop Wells volcanic center. Along with the chronology data, the assumptions, strengths, and limitations of each methods are discussed...|$|E
