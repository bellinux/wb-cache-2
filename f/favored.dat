5|$|Specific {{elements}} were popular {{across the political}} spectrum, while others, such as the mandate to purchase insurance, were widely disliked. In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By party affiliation, 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans <b>favored</b> the law overall. 82% <b>favored</b> banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% <b>favored</b> allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By party affiliation, 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats <b>favored</b> the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E

5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, {{as a leader}} at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice <b>favored</b> by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies <b>favored</b> the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W.

5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate <b>favored</b> by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had <b>favored</b> Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform <b>favored</b> gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform <b>favored</b> silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E

5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield <b>favored</b> {{a tax on}} parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it.

5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also <b>favored</b> this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also <b>favored</b> the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E

40|$|The main {{tenet of}} Likelihoodism is the {{so-called}} Law of Likelihood. In this note, I explain why the Law of Likelihood fails to undergird an adequate explication of <b>favoring.</b> 1. Some Background on the <b>Favoring</b> Relation This (brief) note is about the (evidential) “favoring ” relation. Pre-theoretically, <b>favoring</b> is a three-place (epistemic) relation, between an evidential proposition E and two hypotheses H 1 and H 2. <b>Favoring</b> relations are expressed via locutions of the form: E <b>favors</b> H 1 over H 2. Strictly speaking, <b>favoring</b> should really {{be thought of as}} a four-place relation, between E, H 1, H 2, and a corpus of background evidence K. But, for present purposes (which won't address issues involving K), I will suppress the background corpus, so as to simplify our discussion. Moreover, the <b>favoring</b> relation is meant to be a propositional epistemic relation, as opposed to a doxastic epistemic relation. That is, the <b>favoring</b> relation is not meant to be restricted to bodies of evidence that are possessed (as evidence) by some actual agent(s), or to hypotheses that are (in fact) entertained by some actual agent(s). In this sense, <b>favoring</b> is analogous to the relation of propositional justification — as opposed to doxastic justification (Conee 1980). In order to facilitate a comparison of Likelihoodist vs Bayesian explications of <b>favoring,</b> I will presuppose the following bridge principle, linking <b>favoring</b> and evidential support: • E <b>favors</b> H 1 over H 2 iff E supports H 1 more strongly than E supports H 2. 1 Finally, I will only be discussing instances of the <b>favoring</b> relation involving contingent, empirical claims. So, it is to be understood that “favoring ” will not apply if any of E, H 1, or H 2 are non-contingent (and/or non-empirical). With this background in place, we're ready to begin. 2. A Popperian Sufficient Condition for <b>Favoring</b> Here is an eminently plausible sufficient condition for <b>favoring...</b>|$|R
