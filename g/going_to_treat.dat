In November 2014, Geldof {{announced that he would}} be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as Band Aid 30, to record an updated version of the charity single, with the proceeds <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> victims of the Ebola virus in West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{resident}} of the hotel is the purported ghost of Kate Morgan. On November 24, 1892, she checked into room 304 (then 3318, now 3327). She told staff she was awaiting the arrival of her brother who was a doctor. She said he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> her stomach cancer, but he never arrived. She was found dead on the steps leading to the beach three days later. The case was declared a suicide; she had shot herself. Another tragedy {{took place on the}} beach at the hotel in 1904 when actress Isadore Rush drowned.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E

500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E

They read Linklater's screenplay and then met with him to discuss their respective visions of A Scanner Darkly.

2500|$|We've {{seen here}} at the city of Kent especially, {{probably}} the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups. They make definite plans of burning, destroying, and throwing rocks at police and at the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. This is when we're going to use {{every part of the}} law enforcement agency of Ohio to drive them out of Kent. We are going to eradicate the problem. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the symptoms. And these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They're worse than the brown shirts and the communist element and also the night riders and the vigilantes. They're the worst type of people that we harbor in America. Now I want to say this. They are not going to take over [...] campus. I think that we're up against the strongest, well-trained, militant, revolutionary group that has ever assembled in America.|$|E
2500|$|Leskov was {{continuously}} {{experimenting with}} forms, his most favourable being [...] "the chronicle" [...] which {{he saw as}} a healthy alternative to orthodox novel. [...] "Things pass by us and I'm not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won't be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That's not how life is. Human life runs on {{in its own way}} and that's how I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the roll of events in my works," [...] he once wrote. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary's biographer Semyon Vengerov found in Leskov traits common to Alexander Ostrovsky, Aleksey Pisemsky and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. [...] "But the most astounding feature in him is what Turgenev called his 'inventiveness'. Some of Leskov's 5–6 page stories are packed with plotlines that could have filled volumes. This is especially true for The Enchanted Wanderer where each new turn brings out another fascinating scene, with its own new set of colours. Apart from his large anti-nihilistic novels (No Way Out, At Daggers Drawn), less successful artistically, Leskov's prose is remarkably concise and totally devoid of filler and ballast," [...] Vengerov added.|$|E
2500|$|Having severed {{ties with}} The Russian Messenger, Leskov {{found himself in}} serious {{financial}} trouble. This was relieved to an extent by his invitation in January 1874 to join the Scholarly Committee of the Ministry of Education (for this he owed much to the Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna who was known to have read The Cathedral Clergy and spoke warmly to it), where his duty was to choose literature for Russian libraries and atheneums for a meager wage of one thousand rubles per year. In 1874 Leskov began writing Wandering Lights: A Biography of Praotsev which was soon halted and later printed as Early Years: From Merkula Praotsev’s Memoirs. It was during the publication of this work that the author made a comment which was later seen as his artistic manifesto: [...] "Things pass by us and I'm not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won't be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That's not how life is. Human life runs on {{in its own way}} and that's how I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the roll of events in my works." ...|$|E

25|$|Secretary Rumsfeld {{assured the}} world that the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>treated</b> in a manner {{consistent}} with the treatment of Geneva Convention POWs. In 2004, confidential memos surfaced that discussed the limits to how much pain, discomfort and fear could be used in the interrogation of detainees in the global war on terror. The memos showed that debate within the Bush administration had been resolved in favor of what was later legally determined to be torture.|$|R
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{scenario}} basis, the {{clue to the}} phenomenal success {{of the project was}} the work of Ivan Okhlobystin himself: his doctor, Andrei Evgenievich Bykov, the head of the therapeutic department of the hospital {{and the head of the}} internship department, is the central figure of the entire movie, and the importance of this personality is so big that the rest of the hospital employees and, in fact, the interns themselves, seem to be a kind of [...] "Bykov's army", corresponding to one of several traits of his character. Okhlobystin, through a [...] "paradoxical and ironic rationalism with which he tends to percept the reality," [...] according to a TV critic Valery Zaitsev, creates around him a special, [...] "Okhbystin" [...] space. In a way he reminds very much Hugh Laurie, the British actor playing the main role in the American television series Doctor House. [...] However, the similarity ends there: the character of Okhlobystin, as well as the mentality of all the TV series shot by TNT, is purely Russian, full of love, respect and tenderness as to the profession of the doctor and human suffering. It's no accident that Dr. Bykov regularly [...] "mocks" [...] at a foreign colleague, and in one of the first episodes, having learned that the tiresome intern Levin, just like House, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> rare and complex illnesses, he comes back with a question: who is going then to treat ordinary patients, filling up the hospitals? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of opening track [...] "Still Standing", {{one of the}} first songs written for the album, was tracked by the reality television show format Monica: The Single on Peachtree TV in 2008.

Nevertheless, the track managed to debut within the top eighty on the US Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was used as the theme song of [...] the following year. Second track, Los Da Mystro-crafted [...] "One In a Lifetime", was among a number of songs that leaked a year prior to the album's official release. Announced as the album's leading single at a time, the [...] "lush, piano-laced" [...] song deals with finding true love.
