5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though {{it is common for}} people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. Both of them were eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E
