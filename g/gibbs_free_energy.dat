Adsorption energies and geometries are evaluated as a function of coverage with both the PW 91 generalized gradient-corrected and the optPBE vdW-DF functionals.

Different conclusions are obtained compared to the common approach that neglects vibrational contributions to the <b>Gibbs</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies,</b> particularly for benzene coadsortion with hydrogen and due to large entropy differences in surface <b>Gibbs</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> obtained by the two. Neglect of vibrational contributions and use of the vdW-DF method predicts lower hydrogen coverages coadsorbed with benzene, compared to the quivalent approach with the PW 91 functional.
