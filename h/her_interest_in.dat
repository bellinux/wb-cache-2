5|$|<b>Her</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{education}} {{has been one of}} her most obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates.

5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|While Carey's {{new musical}} {{direction}} caused tension {{between her and}} Columbia, it began to severely strain {{her relationship with her}} husband at the time, Tommy Mottola. Mottola had always been involved in Carey's career, because he was the head of Sony Music, the parent company of her label. Since the time of Carey's debut, Mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career, keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle-of-the-road pop music, despite <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> hip hop.|$|E

5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism.

Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students. The following year, 1883, she founded the Journal of Christian Science (later called the Christian Science Journal), which spread news of her ideas across the United States.|$|E
5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
