40|$|Rotated blades are key {{mechanical}} components in turbine and <b>high</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>fatigues</b> often induce blade cracks. Meanwhile, mistuning is inevitable in rotated blades, which often {{makes it much}} difficult to detect cracks. In order to solve this problem, it is important and necessary to study effects of crack on vibration characteristics of mistuned rotated blades (MRBs). Firstly, a lumped-parameter model is established based on coupled multiple blades, where mistuned stiffness with normal distribution is introduced. Next, a breathing crack model is adopted and eigenvalue analysis is used in coupled lumped-parameter model. Then, numerical analysis is done and effects of depths and positions of a crack on natural frequency, vibration amplitude, and vibration localization parameters are studied. The results show that a crack causes natural frequency decease and vibration amplitude increase of cracked blade. Bifurcations will occur due to a breathing crack. Furthermore, based on natural frequencies and vibration amplitudes, variational factors are defined to detect a crack in MRBs, which are validated by numerical simulations. Thus, the proposed method provides theoretical guidance for crack detection in MRBs...|$|R
