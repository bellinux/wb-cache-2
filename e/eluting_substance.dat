Impurities which elute close together with n-alkanes, phytane and a C 32 hopanoid acid methyl ester are resolved with a valley increase {{of up to}} 100 %. This phenomenon is probably due to fractionation during gas chromatographic elution and enhanced detection monitoring of the isotopic composition of the carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of the <b>eluting</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the possible correlation between the degree of conversion (DC) {{and the amount of}} <b>substances</b> <b>eluted</b> from three commercial cured resin-based cements. The DC of the various resin-based cements was measured by Raman spectroscopy, while the quantity of unreacted monomers released from the cement matrix (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, TEGDMA, urethane dimethacrylate, UDMA, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, HEMA and bisphenol A) was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The obtained results, after multiple statistical evaluation (one way ANOVA, LSD post hoc test), showed no significant differences in the DC values between the resin cements. On the contrary, the results of the HPLC analysis depicted statistically significant differences between the three materials with respect to the amount of leached monomers. In addition, no correlation between the DC and the amount of <b>eluted</b> <b>substances</b> from the tested cured composite cements was found...|$|R

For reversed phase chromatographic separation, a Luna® 5 μm C 18 (2) 100 Å column (150 [*]×[*] 2 mm, Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used. The mobile phase consisted of (A) ammonium formate buffer (0.1 %; pH 3.6), and (B) acetonitrile. For the standard analysis, 5 % B was held for 5 min, then raised to 100 % B within 17 min and held again for 3 min. The analysis of samples containing benzene oxide was performed differently, i.e. by holding 20 % B for 2 min, then raising up to 95 % B within 7 min and holding this concentration for 1.5 min.

40|$|A {{gradient}} HPLC {{approach in}} combination with a countergradient system for online biochemical detection (BCD) to screen for inhibitors of serine proteases is described. For gradient separations, this novel countergradient system was developed to produce a biocompatible constant solvent composition in the BCD. The countergradient system is based on retaining complete gradients in an additional preparative HPLC column, followed by subsequent and reversible elution to the separation column effluent. Major advantages compared with existing countergradient systems are that no additional LC pumps are needed and enhanced stability. The developed countergradient system was systematically characterized applying different gradient programs. Inhibitors eluting in a post-column continuous flow analysis interfere with the enzymatic release of fluorescent 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (AMC) from an AMC-labeled peptide. The inhibitory activity of <b>eluting</b> <b>substances</b> is sensitively detected as the degree of reduced fluorescence intensity.

Complete and sharp separations are obtained on silica gel glass plates or aluminium cards run in benzene-ethyl acetate-methanol solvent systems. Dicarboxylic porphyrin esters from proto-, deutero- and hemato-porphyrin IX have also been separated. Modifications of the analytical methods are described for the rapid separation of porphyrins bearing eight to two methyl ester groups within 10 min on small chromatocards in chloroform-ethyl acetate solvent mixtures. The porphyrins are determined quantitatively by spectrophotometric analysis of the <b>eluted</b> <b>substances,</b> or by fluorescence scanning of the bands of thin-layer chromatograms, using the Camag-Turner TLC-scanner.

30|$|Samples for SEC {{analysis}} were prepared by separating humic acid- like {{molecules from the}} media. Each sample (2  ml) was acidified (pH <  2) by adding 20  μl HCl (37 %), and centrifuged (14, 000, 20  min). The acid supernatant was separated as FA, and the precipitants were re-suspended by adding 2  mL NaOH (0.1  M) and used as HA portion of the sample (Hofrichter and Fritsche 1996). Both FA and HA portions of the samples were analyzed by SEC. The SEC was conducted using Phenomenex column (Yarra™ 3  µm SEC- 2000, LC Column 300  ×  7.8  mm, Ea) connected to an ultra fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) system (Shimadzu, Prominence) to detect changes in the concentration and MW of HA (and FA) molecules during the incubation with WRF. The method was adapted from a protocol {{that has already been}} developed for molecular size fractionation of HA (Asakawa et al. 2011), with slight modification. The mobile phase was 25 % acetonitrile in ultra pure water supplemented with 10  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1  ml/min and the injection volume was 10  μl. Polystyrene sulfonate standards (Polymer Standard Service, Germany) were used for the calibration of the column.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the elution of substances from different materials used for the manufacturing of temporary indirect restorations, after storage in saliva and ethanol 75 %. 10 samples of three chemically cured materials (Protemp 3 Garant, Systemp. c&b, and Trim) and one light-cured material (Clip F) were stored in saliva and ethanol 75 % for 24 [*]h, 7, and days 28 days. From the storage media at each time period, samples were prepared and analysed by LC-MS/MS, in order to access the elution of monomers. The results differed among the materials (P ≤ 0. 05). No monomers were detected in the samples of Protemp 3 Garant and Clip F. Substances were detected only in ethanol samples of Systemp. c&b and Trim. The amount of BisGMA, TEGDMA, and UDMA 2 released from Systemp. c&b was higher compared to Trim. Storage time affected the release of substances (P ≤ 0. 05). The highest release was observed within the first 24 [*]h. It can be concluded that provisional resin composite materials do not show high release of monomers and this release is material dependent.

Resin-based dental restorative materials are complex polymers containing a variety of monomers and filler particles, as well as initiators, activators, stabilizers, plasticizers and other additives. Several {{studies have shown that}} many of the ingredients are leaching from the materials, even after adequate polymerization. It is known from in vitro studies that some of the compounds in the resin-based materials have cytotoxic, genotoxic or estrogenic potential.

50|$|There {{are also}} several {{biological}} responses to implantation of a microelectrode array, particularly {{in regards to}} chronic implantation. Most notable among these effects are neuronal cell loss, glial scarring, and {{a drop in the}} number of functioning electrodes. The tissue response to implantation is dependent among many factors including size of the MEA shanks, distance between the shanks, MEA material composition, and time period of insertion. The tissue response is typically divided into short term and long term response. The short term response occurs within hours of implantation and begins with an increased population of astrocytes and glial cells surrounding the device. The recruited microglia then initiate inflammation and a process of phagocytosis of the foreign material begins. Over time, the astrocytes and microglia recruited to the device begin to accumulate, forming a sheath surrounding the array that extends tens of micrometres around the device. This not only increases the space between electrode probes, but also insulates the electrodes and increases impedance measurements. Problems with chronic implantation of arrays have been a driving force in the research of these devices. One novel study examined the neurodegenerative effects of inflammation caused by chronic implantation. Immunohistochemical markers showed a surprising presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, near the electrode recording site. The phagocytosis of electrode material also brings to question the issue of a biocompatibility response, which research suggests has been minor and becomes almost nonexistent after 12 weeks in vivo. Research to minimize the negative effects of device insertion includes surface coating of the devices with proteins that encourage neuron attachment, such as laminin, or drug <b>eluting</b> <b>substances.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{decrease}} in pH {{with the addition}} of nWE-MC can be explained by differences in the manufacturing processes between MC and the other charcoals. Woody materials generate considerable amounts of smoke during heat treatment for making charcoal. The smoke is sufficiently removed from OC and BC in the manufacturing processes; however, the removal of components from MC through the smoke may be incomplete. A note on the package of commercial MC usually indicates that this charcoal must be used outdoors, because its combustion often emits harmful smoke. Pyroligneous acid, known as “wood vinegar,” is obtained by cooling this smoke; this acid is strongly acid. Therefore, it is most likely that MC contains more acidic organic substances compared with OC and BC, and the elution of these substances decreases the pH of the sample solutions. The pH-decreasing effect of <b>eluted</b> acidic <b>substances</b> can be assumed to be superior to the pH-increasing effect of the eluted group 1 and 2 metal ions with respect to nWE-MC, and the two effects for MC are approximately equivalent to each other.|$|R

Similar techniques were used to purify serum β-lysin active against Bacillus subtilis approximately 24, 000 times. The staphylocidal activity cannot be attributed to the same β-lysin active against B. subtilis, lysozyme, or antibody-complement systems. The concentrations of staphylocidal β-lysin in the sera of the five mammalian species studied did not correlate with their β-lysin activities against B. subtilis. The two β-lysins are similar in that both were heat-stable, sensitive to trypsin digestion, had molecular weights near 6, 000, and were found in higher concentrations in serum than in plasma. Furthermore, similar techniques can be used to absorb and <b>elute</b> both <b>substances</b> in highly purified forms using cellulose asbestos filter pads and ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. In contrast to the β-lysin against B. subtilis, the staphylocidal β-lysin was not released from blood platelets, and it was inactive in the presence of heparin, sodium citrate, sodium oxalate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, acidic phospholipids, and acid pH values.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether nitrosative stress (via peroxynitrite(ONOO-)) plays a role or even causes various {{neurological}} diseases in children. In literature there have been several examples of neurological diseases which seem to caused or at least influenced by nitrosative stress, such as Alzheimers disease, ALS, inflammations, multiple sclerosis etc. Therefore cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of 40 children and 3 adults (= 43 patients) with various neurological diseases and CSF of 18 children out of a controll group was tested. The 43 patients suffered from diseases which in one way or the other could have been influenced by increased production of peroxynitrite. To show the excess of peroxynitrite production, 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT) was measured, since peroxynitrite itself is a very instable product. 3 -NT can be seen as an indicator of nitrosative stress (and peroxynitrite), since it is a stable product out of the reaction of tyrosine und peroxynitrite. High performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) combined with electrochemical detection was used to determine the amount of 3 -NT. It seemed to be the method of choice because using this method even very small amounts of 3 -NT could be detected. Furthermore this method isnt that expensive compared to other methods such as mass-spectroscopy, which is an important factor in routine 3 -NT-investigation. At first, several experiments were made to show that our used machine worked exact and linear, and to show the influences of various parameters such as pH of mobile phase. This was followed by the investigation of CSF of patients and controll-group. But only eight out of the 43 patients had increased levels of 3 -NT. In addition one child out of the cotroll group showed increased rates. The average concentration of 3 -NT in the " 3 -NT-positive" probes was 4. 73 nM. In the other probes no 3 -NT could be determined, that means the concentration was 0 nM. Now theres the question why only in eight out of the 43 patients an increased level of 3 -NT could be detected. Three out of these eight patients were adults suffering from multiple sclerosis. All of the detected increased rates werent as high they were expected to be, compared to literature. One reason could be that never before children had been tested for 3 -NT, so there is no direct comparison in literature. Mayby no 3 -NT is produced in childrens brains at all, so no 3 -NT could be shown in the controll group. Compared to this, the average rate of 4. 73 nM 3 -NT in "positive" probes could be an excessive increased level. Furthermore only free, not protein-bound 3 -NT was measured. All of the in literature described 3 -NT-increases were found in CSF probes, which proteins had been hydolysated before. Therefore, protein-bound- 3 -NT was as well detected. Protein-bound 3 -NT wasnt detected in this study, so of course the detected rates were lower. Another thing is that one cant tell for sure that the detected substance really is 3 -NT or another substance which has the same retention time and coelutes with 3 -NT. To make sure that it is indeed 3 -NT,one could gather the <b>eluted</b> <b>substance</b> and investigates it mass spectroscopidly. Finally one can say that there are many open questions,which need further studys. The CSF probes of the examined children should once more be tested for 3 -NT hydrolysatinproteins. The found substanz should furthermore be definitly be identified as 3 - NT. Only then the results can really be compared to results in literature. Therefore this study shall only be looked upon as a beginning of investigation in nitrosative stress causing neurological diseases in children, which has to followed by many other studys. It should be rather be looked upon as establishing a new method showing investigation starts...|$|R

RPLC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and subcritical fluid chromatography (SFC) were tested. The comparison was based on the retention, selectivity, peak shape (asymmetry and peak width) and MS sensitivity. As expected, RPLC had some obvious limitations for such classes of compounds, and on average the %ACN required to <b>elute</b> these hydrophilic <b>substances</b> was 4, 7, and 11 % ACN at pH 3, 6, and 9, respectively. However, a hybrid polar-embedded C 18 phase with an appropriate mobile phase could represent a viable strategy for hydrophilic basic compounds with log D greater than - 2 on average. HILIC and SFC were found to be more appropriate for analyzing a large majority of these hydrophilic analytes (~ 60 and 70 % of compounds eluted during the gradient in HILIC and SFC), while maintaining good MS sensitivity. Finally, this work demonstrated the complementarity of the three analytical techniques and showed that the selection of a suitable strategy should mostly be based on physicochemical properties of the analytes (pKa, log D, H-bonding capability, etc.) ...|$|R

Sodium aurothiomalate and thiomalic acid without gold both caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition of both cell lines when used in the concentration range 25 - 300 mumol/l culture medium and for four days' exposure.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of biologically active inositol phosphates {{in developed}} ovarian follicles from Xenopus laevis was investigated. Techniques used were microinjection of tracer into the intact oocyte coupled by gap junctions to follicle cells, {{as well as}} addition of tracer to homogenates of ovarian follicles and to homogenates of oocytes stripped of outer follicle-cell layers. Metabolism {{was similar to that}} previously described for other types of cell and tissue, with several unusual features. Homogenates of ovarian follicles were shown to contain an apparent 3 '-phosphomonoesterase capable of converting [3 H]Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4 predominantly into a substance with h. p. l. c. elution characteristics of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3. In intact ovarian follicles, little Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 was formed but the esterase was activated by the phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C, PMA (phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate; 60 nM), as well as by acetylcholine (200 microM). In follicle homogenates, this enzyme also appeared to be active in converting [3 H]Ins(1, 3, 4) P 3 into a <b>substance</b> <b>eluting</b> as Ins(1, 4) P 2. The apparent 3 '-phosphomonoesterase activity was not inhibited by intracellular (or higher) levels of Mg 2 +. Although PMA activated this enzyme in intact oocytes relative to 5 '-phosphomonoesterase activation, it did not enhance overall metabolism, in contrast with reports on other tissues. Compared with the processing of inositol phosphates injected into the intact follicle, homogenization in simulated intracellular medium appeared to alter the activity and/or accessibility of several enzymes. The metabolism of inositol phosphates appears to occur predominantly in the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte, as collagenase treatment followed by defolliculation greatly diminished the rates of metabolism of several inositol phosphates. The presence in Xenopus ovarian follicles of a 3 '-phosphomonoesterase activated by protein kinase C in addition to the well-known 3 '-kinase suggests that, by forming a reversible interconversion between Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 and Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4, this tissue may have the potential to prolong stimulatory signals on binding of appropriate agonists to receptors...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion of {{bacteria}} differing in cell surface hydrophobicity, growth and viability of single isolates of Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from catheter associated infections to catheter made of polyurethane, hydrophilic polyurethane, teflon, vialon and siliconised latex was evaluated {{before and after}} In vitro exposure to test dose of 25 Gy of gamma radiation. The cell surface hydrophobicity of the tested strains was assessed by hexadecane method. Hydrophobic strains adhered more efficiently to the catheter surface than hydrophilic strains. Low number of the hydrophilic Staphylococcus epidermidis cells can adhere to the polyurethane catheter surface. Irradiation cause {{a change in the}} cell surface hydrophobicity of the tested strains. Colonization of polyurethane and hydrophilic polyurethane in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to non-irradiated and irradiated K lebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli was followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Regular sampling of specimens at 1 h, 3 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. demonstrated colonization and adhesion progression with an increase in the exposure interval of the non irradiated cells to the polyurethane catheter surface followed by cell proliferation, possible break down of catheter components and production of a slimy material covering the bacterial colonies. Adherence and colonization of the irradiated cells showed reduction in cells number along the incubation time with abnormalities in the cells shape and size. While, the adherence of the non-irradiated and irradiated cells to the hydrophilic polyurethane surface showed marked decrease in number of cells with abnormalities in the cells shape and size. Bacterial adherence and colonization of catheters in distilled water were the same as in PBS and slightly delayed in the microcolony formation. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. Non of the eluates increase the viability and growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis along the incubation time. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of non-irradiated (Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) {{with the exception of the}} eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced for E. coli. The initial growth in different catheter eluates was higher for non-irradiated strains than irradiated ones with all biomaterials tested. So, bacterial adherence to catheter may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that <b>substances</b> <b>eluted</b> from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different microorganisms. The non irradiated strains can grow in catheter eluates and colonies catheter surface better than the irradiated strains. Although, The irradiation change the hydrophobicity of the tested strains as well as reduce the number of cells with abnormalities in shape and size, the irradiated strains also persist on these biomaterials. The implications of these findings may be important in the pathogenesis of foreign body infections and utilization of new biomaterials to prevent bacterial adherence and colonization in immuno-compromised patients...|$|R
