500|$|Joshua Thompson, who {{previously}} arranged for Olivia's audition for Arista Records' executives and Davis, produced her demo. [...] "Bizounce" [...] {{was produced by}} Thompson and Doug Allen, who {{also contributed to the}} writing along with Olivia, David L. Conley, Quincy Q. Patrick, and Juan Magic" [...] Peters. JRecords senior vice president Ron Gillyard described Olivia as [...] "the real deal", emphasizing her roles as [...] "a songwriter, a singer, and a rapper". Olivia later described the recording and promotion of [...] "Bizounce" [...] and the album as a learning experience for her future ventures; she said her time at J Records was: [...] "cut short by the politics of the industry and me not actually taking my career <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> hands". She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album because of her youth and inexperience.|$|E
500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before I start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
500|$|Olivia later {{viewed the}} {{recording}} of the album as a learning experience for her future music ventures; she said her time at the record label [...] "was cut short by {{the politics of the}} industry and me not actually taking my career <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> hands". She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album given her youth and inexperience. In her 2014 autobiography Release Me: My Life, My Words, Olivia wrote that she did not consider building a cohesive set of songs during the recording process and identified the album as lacking a clear direction. During promotion for the record, Olivia described having a good working relationship with Davis, but she called him [...] "extremely controlling" [...] after leaving the label. Olivia claimed that she was forced to be the bad girl while label mate Alicia Keys was promoted as the good girl. In an official statement, JRecords' representatives pointed to Olivia's credits as a co-writer for a majority of the album as proof of her involvement with the project and maintained: [...] "Clive doesn't categorize artists as good or bad girls". After her release from JRecords, American rapper 50 Cent and Interscope Geffen A Records chairman Jimmy Iovine signed Olivia to G-Unit Records. 50 Cent said he enjoyed Olivia's previous work and blamed J Records for sabotaging her career.|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deep Wound {{broke up}} in mid-1984. Cosloy {{had dropped out}} of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to focus on running his {{independent}} record label, Homestead Records, and promised Mascis that if he were to make a record Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow said the songs [...] "were fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama." [...] Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy, otherwise known as Murph, to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as [...] "ear-bleeding country".|$|E

2500|$|References to {{film and}} allusions to theatre, literature, dance, painting, {{television}} and advertising [...] "are {{central to the}} world that Almodóvar constructs on screen". Film critic José Arroyo noted that Almodóvar [...] "borrows indiscriminately from film history". Almodóvar has acknowledged that [...] "cinema is always present in my films [...] certain films play an active part in my scripts. When I insert an extract from a film, it isn't a homage but outright theft. It's part of the story I'm telling, and becomes an active presence rather than a homage which is always something passive. I absorb the films I've seen <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> experience, which immediately becomes the experience of my characters". Almodóvar has alluded to the work of many different artists and genres in his work; sometimes works have been referenced diagetically or evoked through less direct methods. Almodóvar has additionally made self-references to films within his own oeuvre.|$|E
2500|$|The character's {{wardrobe}} originally encompassed a rocker yet feminine look. She {{would drive}} {{around in a}} vintage car, listening to loud rock, often wearing a Ramones T-shirt. [...] " [...] – I just love her. Working with her (has) been wonderful. For her, [...] more of the do-it-yourself girl. She’s so into music, art, she’s such a rich character {{that there are a}} lot of different things to draw on," [...] stated One Tree Hill’s costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Sometimes she’ll just be in a plaid flannel shirt because she’s painting. Some days she’ll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt. I do alter them a lot." [...] Cutshall would take a men’s concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. [...] "She’s also very, very slender, so I’ll taper them down to her figure. We come out of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take something and then turn it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> piece of clothing," [...] said Cutshall. Peyton’s main brands have been Cheap Monday, Levi’s, some Diesel and Miss Sixty.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of the English {{architect}} Maxwell Fry, Gropius was able to leave Nazi Germany in 1934, on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Italy for a film propaganda festival; he then fled to Britain to avoid the fascist powers of Europe. He lived and worked in Britain, as part of the Isokon group with Fry and others and then moved on to the United States with his family. Walter Gropius and his second wife, Ise Gropius, arrived in the United States in February 1937, while their twelve-year-old daughter, Ati, finished the school year in England. Though built in 1938, the Gropiuses believed their house could embody architectural qualities similar to those practiced today, such as simplicity, economy, and aesthetic beauty. In designing his house, Gropius used the approach developed at the Bauhaus. The house the Gropiuses built for themselves in Lincoln, Massachusetts (now known as Gropius House), was influential in bringing International Modernism to the U.S., but Gropius disliked the term: [...] "I {{made it a point to}} absorb <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate." [...] Helen Storrow, a banker's wife and philanthropist, became Gropius's benefactor when she invested a portion of her land and wealth for the architect's home. She was so satisfied with the result that she gave more land and financial support to four other professors, two of whom Gropius designed homes for. With the Bauhaus philosophy in mind, every aspect of the homes and their surrounding landscapes were planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius’s house received a huge response and was declared a National Landmark in 2000.|$|E
