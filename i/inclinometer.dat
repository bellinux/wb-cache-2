2500|$|The {{transport}} trailer (SST) is {{the width}} of a standard trailer (96 inches or 8 Feet). [...] While the trailer appears conventional from the outside, the back doors are over 12" [...] thick, and an average-sized male can put their arms out from their sides and lay their palms flat against the wall. [...] There are three sets of nozzles coming out of the ceiling. One nozzle purges the air out, the other nozzle fills the trailer with a noxious chemical to disable an attacker. [...] This system can be activated from the cab of the truck, by any one of the escort teams (each vehicle is a team), or from dispatch. [...] Finally there is a <b>inclinometer</b> - if the trailer get off level by a certain degree, the entire inside of the trailer is filled with expanding, fast-hardening foam.|$|E

40|$|The {{geological}} {{structure of}} the Bełchatów area is very complicated {{as a result of}} tectonic and sedimentation processes. The long-term exploitation of the Bełchatów field influenced the development of horizontal displacements. The variety of factors that have impact on the Bełchatów western slope stability conditions, forced the necessity of complex geotechnical monitoring. The geotechnical monitoring of the western slope was carried out with the use of slope <b>inclinometers.</b> From 2005 to 2013 fourteen slope <b>inclinometers</b> were installed, however, currently seven of them are in operation. The present analysis depicts <b>inclinometers</b> situated in the north part of the western slope, for which the largest deformations were registered. The results revealed that the horizontal displacements and formation of slip surfaces are related to complicated geological structure and intensive tectonic deformations in the area. Therefore, the influence of exploitation marked by changes in slope geometry was also noticeable...|$|R
