5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking <b>for</b> <b>one.</b> <b>That</b> doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|She then played six matches for the Second XI in {{the space}} of a week, mostly as a top-order batsman, {{sometimes}} opening and as a wicket-keeper. New South Wales won all the fixtures except <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was abandoned due to inclement weather. She scored 120 runs at 40.00, took six catches and made three stumpings, and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second-string outfit. In her first three matches back, Healy was placed in the middle-order and not required to bat or keep wickets. In the last league match, she scored 59 from 55 balls in an 89-run partnership at faster than a run a ball with Lisa Sthalekar against Victoria. New South Wales won by three wickets despite losing Healy and three subsequent batsmen in the closing phase of the run-chase. In the final against the same team the following week, Healy made 11 from 22 balls before being run out, but New South Wales nevertheless won by six wickets with more than 15 overs to spare to claim the title. Healy ended the one-day competition with 79 runs at 26.33. She was named Australia's 30-strong shortlist for the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, but was not a part of the final squad of 15.|$|E
5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1830s the Erie Canal, built two decades earlier, {{had become so}} {{successful}} that its management {{found it necessary to}} build the Enlarged Erie Canal to handle larger vessels.

The Cohoes Company, which operated a smaller, local canal system that provided water power to the industry attracted to the area by the canal, took over the former route.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Moore scoured {{public domain}} films looking <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> exuded a certain mood, {{intending}} {{to write a}} pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was Age 13, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled Graveyard Mountain Home, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore's music.|$|E
25|$|As {{the soldier}} {{emperors}} such as Maximinus Thrax (r. 235–8) {{emerged from the}} provinces in the 3rd century, they brought with them their own regional influences and artistic tastes. For example, artists jettisoned the classical portrayal {{of the human body}} <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was more rigid and frontal. This is markedly evident in the combined porphyry Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs in Venice. With these stubby figures clutching each other and their swords, all individualism, naturalism, the verism or hyperrealism of Roman portraiture, and Greek idealism diminish. The Arch of Constantine in Rome, which re-used earlier classicising reliefs together with ones in the new style, shows the contrast especially clearly. In nearly all artistic media, simpler shapes were adopted and once natural designs were abstracted. Additionally hierarchy of scale overtook the preeminence of perspective and other classical models for representing spatial organization.|$|E

500|$|The {{greatest}} {{influence on}} Madison's text, however, was existing state constitutions. Many of his amendments, including his proposed new preamble, {{were based on}} the Virginia Declaration of Rights drafted by Anti-Federalist George Mason in 1776. To reduce future opposition to ratification, Madison also looked for recommendations shared by many states. He did provide one, however, that no state had requested: [...] "No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases." [...] He did not include an amendment that every state had asked <b>for,</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> would have made tax assessments voluntary instead of contributions.|$|E
500|$|New Line {{contracted}} with two {{high schools in}} Illinois, Elk Grove High School and John Hersey High School, to use their location for scenes in the remake. According to Principal Nancy Holman, of Elk Grove High, the studio contacted schools across the nation looking <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> had a swimming pool. Although filming took place at both schools, neither was identified by name. The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old. School board President Lenore Gonzales Bragaw was initially apprehensive about the deal, as she disliked {{the idea of the}} studio filming [...] "scenes of violence" [...] at the schools; Bragaw agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1960s, the Green Books market was {{beginning}} to erode; African-American civil rights activism was having effects, even before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit racial segregation in public facilities. An increasing number of middle-class African Americans were beginning to question whether guides such as the Green Book were accommodating Jim Crow by steering black travelers to segregated businesses rather than encouraging them to push for equal access. Black-owned motels in remote locations off state highways lost customers to a new generation of integrated interstate motels located near freeway exits. The 1963 Green Book acknowledged that the activism {{of the civil rights movement}} had [...] "widened the areas of public accommodations accessible to all," [...] but it defended the continued listing of black-friendly businesses because [...] "a family planning for a vacation hopes <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> is free of tensions and problems." ...|$|E

500|$|The Jajce salient was {{supported}} via a [...] road running {{through a narrow}} corridor {{to the town of}} Travnik. In July, the VRS attempted to cut the supply corridor and isolate Jajce from Travnik before any effort was made to capture the salient, but the attacks failed to accomplish any significant headway. This prompted the VRS to switch to a gradual advance along three separate axes converging on Jajce directly instead. The move was designed to minimize VRS casualties and allow a systematic elimination of HVO and ARBiH defences around the town. ARBiH-HVO successfully defended Jajce from the VRS, in part thanks to the area's mountainous surroundings. In the same month, feuding between the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) over political control began and the HVO forcibly disbanded the Bosniak-led war presidency in Jajce in exchange <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was pro-Croat.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss and Moffat had {{considered}} adapting {{the character of}} Charles Augustus Milverton for some time, considering {{him to be a}} [...] "brilliantly realised" [...] villain. Moffat viewed Magnussen as Sherlock's [...] "intellectual mirror" [...] and a [...] "unique baddy", and stated that {{he fell in love with}} him. The character of Magnussen was originally conceived as an American retaining the name of Milverton, but Moffat changed both his nationality and name when Mikkelsen was cast. He found the name Magnussen on a website of Danish names, looking <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> resembled Milverton, the name of the original character from Doyle's short story. Gatiss noted that the character is a [...] "fascinating new place to go" [...] due to his differences from Moriarty. When Mikkelsen received the script, he stated that his first impression was that it was [...] "the best script I've ever read". Contrasting Magnussen to Moriarty, Cumberbatch stated that he was [...] "so chilling because of how real he is, how normal he is", and that he is [...] "not driven by a mad, chaotic joker's energy that Moriarty has".|$|E
500|$|The group {{experimented with}} several {{gameplay}} models, and opted <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric dungeon crawling video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind; each character's abilities allow different {{interactions with the}} environment and other characters. [...] For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them. [...] Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions. [...] Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a game over in the event one or more team member was defeated. [...] Raven included flash back missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues. Originally a single-player game, Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co-orperative gameplay. [...] The developers chose to not create an online multi-player mode, stating that the gameplay was [...] "designed around localized encounters." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{reverse is}} based on a statue of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii, {{designed}} by Thomas R. Gould, and intended [...] "to symbolize the past and future glory of the Kingdom [...] ". The sculpture that stands in downtown Honolulu (1883) is a replacement <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> sank while being transported from Germany; the original (1880) was later salvaged and stands at Kohala on the island of Hawaii. The coin features a Hawaiian chieftain in ceremonial dress surmounting the top of a hill, with his arm extended in greeting. He represents Hawaii rising from obscurity. The palm tree that rises above him is intended to signify romance. A Hawaiian village at Waikiki Beach with Diamond Head nearby are seen behind him, representing history and antiquity. The design is almost free of lettering, with only [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM" [...] ("Out of many, one") and 1778 1928 to be seen. Ferns are visible under that Latin motto: Houston wanted the plants removed, but Beach insisted on retaining them to balance the design. Juliette Fraser had made a number of sketches, all with the same basic design elements, but with the chieftain in various poses and with Diamond Head in different positions.|$|E
2500|$|It {{should be}} noted, though, that sabab-material did not {{originate}} with the asbāb al-nuzūl genre. [...] The chief innovation {{of the genre}} was organizational (i.e. the collection of asbāb-material within one text) {{and to a lesser}} degree methodological, and so while no work prior to al-Wāhidī's Kitāb may be properly called an instance of asbāb al-nuzūl, material of equivalent function exists in the earliest hadith and tafsir.
