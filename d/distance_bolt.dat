40|$|Despite {{fundamental}} {{differences in the}} mechanical behaviour of stainless steel and carbon steel, design provisions for stainless steel connections in current standards essentially follow the rules for carbon steel with some limited modifications. For the case of net section capacity, the design rules from EN 1993 - 1 - 3 for cold-formed carbon steel have been adopted for stainless steel connections in EN 1993 - 1 - 4 and the SCI/Euro Inox Design Manual without any modification. In this paper, {{an investigation into the}} behaviour of stainless steel connections failing by net section rupture has been conducted. Numerical models for austenitic and ferritic stainless steel have been developed and validated against existing test results.

For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebuseers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century.

After an initial bolt movement, the load vs bolt displacement plots are linear until the joints fail or the stiffness reduces significantly.

30|$|The {{equilibrium}} stress {{inside a}} roadway changes after excavation. The {{stress in the}} shallow surrounding rock transforms from a triaxial stress state to a biaxial one, and the surrounding rock often contains many fracture zones. To maintain road stability, rock bolts {{can be used to}} support the roof and {{the two sides of the}} roadway. The pre-tightening force is applied overtime. With many bolts of appropriate length and separation <b>distance,</b> the <b>bolt</b> groups work together to create a load-bearing structure with a certain degree of strength, even with fractured, loose, or soft rocks. This load-bearing structure is referred to as a “composite rock-bolt bearing structure” in this study Song and Mu (1997). Bolting improves the internal stress state of the surrounding rock in this compound structure and increases the cohesion and internal friction angle, thus preventing the spread of the elastic zone in the rock surrounding the roadway and significantly decreasing rock deformation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare and determine the relevance of the morphological characteristics and variability of running speed parameters (stride length and stride frequency) between Usain Bolt’s three best 100 m performances. Based on this, an attempt was made to define which factors determine the performance of Usain Bolt's sprint and, therefore, distinguish him from other sprinters. We analyzed the previous world record of 9. 69 s set in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the current record of 9. 58 s set in the 2009 Berlin World Championships in Athletics and the O lympic record of 9. 63 s set in 2012 London Olympics Games by Usain Bolt. The application of VirtualDub Programme allowed the acquisition of basic kinematical variables such as step length and step frequency parameters of 100 m sprint from video footage provided by NBC TV station, BBC TV station. This data was compared with other data available on the web and data published by the Scientific Research Project Office responsible on behalf of IAAF and the German Athletics Association (DVL). The main hypothesis was that the step length is the main factor that determines running speed in the 10 and 20 m sections of the entire 100 m <b>distance.</b> <b>Bolt’s</b> anthropometric advantage (body height, leg length and liner body) is not questionable and {{it is one of the}} factors that makes him faster than the rest of the finalists from each three competitions. Additionally, Bolt’s 20 cm longer stride shows benefit in the latter part of the race. Despite these factors, he is probably able to strike the ground more forcefully than rest of sprinters, relative to their body mass, therefore, he might maximize his time on the ground and to exert the same force over this period of time. This ability, combined with longer stride allows him to create very high running speed - over 12 m/s (12. 05 - 12. 34 m/s) in some 10 m sections of his three 100 m performances. These assumption confirmed the application of Ballerieich's formula for speed development. In most 10 m sections of the 100 m sprint, the step length was the parameter that significantly determined the increase of maximal running speed, therefore, distinguishing Bolt from the other finalists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stainless steel {{has been}} {{utilized}} on structural members of building due to significant characteristics in its superior corrosion resistance, durability, aesthetic appeal etc. Recently, structural behaviors and curling effect in single shear bolted connection fabricated with thin-walled plane plates {{have been studied}} by T.

The validation of numerical approach was verified to predict the structural behaviors such as fracture mode, ultimate strength and curling occurrence of bolted connections. Curling (out-of- plane deformation) also occurred in the connections with a long end <b>distance</b> like <b>bolted</b> connections assembled with plane plates. The curling caused the ultimate strength reduction and ultimate strength reduction caused by curling has been estimated quantitatively through the comparison of FEA results of FE models with free edge and restrained curling.

Therefore, the ultimate strengths were compared with current design strengths and reasonable strength formulae for connections with no curling effect were proposed...|$|R

The anchor bolts are embedded sufficiently {{to develop the}} minimum tensile strength of the bolt steel. Pairs of anchor bolts (double-bolt anchorages) with varying spacings and edge distances are loaded in shear in the direction perpendicular {{to the line of}} the bolts. Single-bolt anchorages are also tested in shear with varying edge distances and compared with the results of the double-bolt anchorage tests. Concrete failure with wedge cone is observed in most cases. The effects of the edge <b>distance</b> and <b>bolt</b> spacing on the shear resistance of anchor bolts are discussed. The ACI Committee 349 shear resistance formula has been found to give good estimates of the singlebolt anchorage tests.

The influence of the support conditions of the concrete test blocks on anchor bolt shear strengths is also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|A Removable Bolt (or [...] "RB"), in climbing, is {{a spring}} loaded metal camming device used to anchor {{a person or}} a load to a rock or cement wall temporarily. Removable Bolts negate the need to install {{permanent}} protection bolts to the wall, which can be costly and cause cosmetic damage. RBs are designed for use in bolting new sport climbing routes, setting temporary anchors on traditional routes, and on back-country expeditions where abandoning gear or placing permanent gear is not optimal. RBs are particularly popular when placing permanent bolts on steep walls with limited features, where other means of temporary protection, such as hooks, traditional camming devices, or slings, are not an option. By drilling a hole and inserting an RB, the bolter can ascend higher up on the rock before placing the next permanent piece of protection, thereby leaving a reasonable climbing <b>distance</b> between <b>bolts</b> on the finished route. RBs have also been designed and produced for fall prevention and safety in construction and mining operations.|$|R
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short <b>distance.</b> As the <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
40|$|Introduction A widely {{distributed}} commercially available target station for the irradiation of solid targets is the COSTIS system. The system is specified for beams up to 500 W and {{is equipped with}} a front side He-cooling and water cooling on the back side. The target itself has a coin shape with a diameter of 24 mm and thickness of 2 mm. This recommends the system for irradiation of thin targets like foils but it is also useable for irradiation of metal and oxide powders. However the irradiation of powders and granulates is limited due to the dimension of the target capsule. A setup of a capped closed target is hardly achievable. The purpose of this work was the modification of the COSTIS target station for the use of thicker target capsules. This shall enable the more easy and safe handling and irradiation of powdery targets and the use of lockable target capsules. Material and Methods The adaption of the COSTIS system for wider targets is easy and fast achievable by the ex-change of the target guiding plate together with the four <b>distance</b> <b>bolts</b> and their bearings. The effort of the replacement of the standard with the modified parts is comparable with COSTIS maintenance including exchange of the window foil and the O-rings. For the target capsule itself different designs were developed and tested. Now various target capsules are available, depending on required energy, handling needs and properties of the target material. Different locking systems can be used, from “click” capsules to screwable systems. Additionally the tightness of the target capsule can be achieved by placement of on O-ring between the lid and capsule body. Results and Conclusion The wider target body allows the capping of the target material. This enables a wide range of applications. One aspect is the nanoparticle research, where radiolabelling is an excellent tool for in situ online investigations. The chosen design of the target capsule allowed the direct activation of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Via the nuclear reaction 48 Ti(p,n) 48 V radiolabelled [48 V]TiO 2 nanoparticles can be obtained. Another example is the use of recoil effects for radiolabelling of nanoparticles. In this case the kinetic energy of the product of the nuclear reaction 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be is used to implant a radioactive tracer in different nanomaterials like Ag 0 – nanoparticles and MWCNT (multi wall carbon nano tubes). In general the irradiation of powders and granulates benefits from the modified design that allows the more flexible adaption to experimental needs...|$|R

In addition Lee introduced a superior detachable box magazine to replace the integral magazines in use with most repeaters, and this magazine offered greater capacity than the competing Mannlicher design. Metford's polygonal rifling was adopted to reduce fouling from powder residue building up in the barrel, and also made it easier to clean.|$|R
