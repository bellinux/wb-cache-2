30|$|The first basic {{principles}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dental CBCT were introduced {{by both the}} American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and the European Academy of Dental and Maxillofacial Radiology [4, 5]. Soon after that, evidence-based guidelines <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> CBCT in dental and maxillofacial radiology were prepared by the Sedentexct Project, i.e. European Commission guidelines [6]. In addition, the European Academy of Dental and Maxillofacial Radiology has prepared a position paper for basic training requirements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dental CBCT by dentists [7].|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1800s <b>the</b> need <b>for</b> an English hymnal had become apparent. Walther himself {{recommended}} <b>the</b> Hymn Book <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> Evangelical Lutheran Schools and Congregations, {{which had been}} edited by Professor August Crull of Concordia College in Fort Wayne, Indiana and published in 1879 by the Norwegian Lutherans in Decorah, Iowa. Other English hymnbooks that were used especially for outreach included Lutheran Hymns: <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> English Lutheran Missions (1882), Hymns of the Evangelical Lutheran Church: <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> English Lutheran Missions (1886), and Hymns for Evangelical Lutheran Missions (1905).|$|R
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|Even though Congress {{set up a}} {{framework}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metric system in the nineteenth century, the United States continues to use US customary units, based on English measure passed by parliament under the reign of Queen Anne in 1706, for most purposes apart from science and medicine.

5|$|Following {{requests}} by Singaporeans, guidelines <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag {{were further}} broadened in 2006 to give residents {{a variety of}} opportunities to express their loyalty to Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the National Day Parade. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, {{from the middle of}} July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.|$|E

The college was created in August 2013 from the merger of Adam Smith College, Fife and Carnegie College, Dunfermline. The University of Dundee also has a campus in the town which specialises as a School for Nursing and Midwifery. Originally built by the Fife Health Board <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Fife College of Further and Higher Education, this campus {{was taken over by}} the University in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the {{building}} was in use as a naval hospital when fire damaged much of the interior, but was confined to the newer additions by Barry. Scottish architect Sir Robert Lorimer was engaged to renovate the house following the First World War. When the 5th Duke died in 1963, the Earldom and the house went to his niece, the current Countess of Sutherland, while the Dukedom had to pass to a male heir and went to John Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere. Between 1965 and 1972, the house became a boarding school for boys, taking on forty boys and five teachers in its first year. Since 1973, the house and grounds have been open to the public, with private accommodation retained <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sutherland family.|$|E

This contract has a revenue of NOK9 million per year. In 2009, Stabæk Holding had a deficit of NOK66.1 million, while Stabæk Fotball lost NOK23.6 million. To keep the operating company running, Ulrichsen increased the company's share capital by NOK73 million from late 2009 through late 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{the court}} case, {{it was also}} cited that the design for winged {{toasters}} was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm {{was unaware of the}} previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.|$|E
5|$|Initially it {{had been}} planned that the Australians {{would be sent to}} the United Kingdom, where they would {{undertake}} further training prior to being sent to the Western Front in France and Belgium. However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, {{and as a result of}} this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.|$|E

5|$|Knox led a busy life in Geneva. He preached three sermons a week, each lasting {{well over}} two hours. The {{services}} used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques. The church {{in which he}} preached, the Église de Notre Dame la Neuve—now known as the Auditoire de Calvin—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.|$|E
5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Electric system; {{in exchange for the}} sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local doctors. By {{the middle of the}} 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice to cool the interiors of its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural ice to keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
