40|$|According to this report, {{regulatory}} {{reforms are}} needed for the Australian retail industry to adapt successfully to the more globally competitive market in which it now operates. 	There are almost 140 000 retail businesses in Australia, accounting for 4. 1 per cent of GDP and 10. 7 per cent of employment. 	The retail industry exhibits great diversity by: size of business, region, retail format, competition within sectors and {{in the nature of}} goods sold. Both current trading conditions and longer term trends are challenging. Retail sales growth has trended down over the past half decade as consumers save more of their rising incomes and their spending is increasingly directed towards a range of non-retail services. 	The retail industry has met many competitive challenges in the past. Online retailing and the entry of new innovative global retailers are just the latest. The intensified competition is good for consumers, but is challenging for the industry which, as a whole, does not compare favourably in terms of productivity with many overseas countries. And the productivity gap appears to have widened over time. 	Australia also appears to lag a number of comparable countries in its development of online retailing. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s best estimate is that online retailing represents 6 per cent of total Australian retail sales - made up of 4 per cent domestic online (8. 4 billion) and 2 per cent from overseas (4. 2 billion). In some other countries, online sales figures are higher and set to grow further, as will also happen here. 	Retailers operate under several regulatory regimes that restrict their competitiveness and ability to innovate. Major restrictions which need to be addressed are: 	 		planning and zoning regulations which are complex, excessively prescriptive, and often anticompetitive 		trading hours regulations which restrict the industry 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adapt and compete with online competitors and provide the convenience that consumers want. 	 	 	Workplace relations regulations may not provide sufficient workplace flexibility to facilitate the adoption of best practice productivity measures in the retail industry, and require examination in the reviews scheduled in 2012. 	The current level of the low value threshold (LVT) for exemption from GST and duty on imports of 1000 is judged to be a minor part of the competitive disadvantage faced by retailers. But there are strong in principle grounds for the LVT to be lowered significantly, to promote tax neutrality with domestic sales. However, the Government should not proceed to lower the LVT until it is cost effective to do so. 	The Government should establish a taskforce charged with investigating new approaches to the processing of low value imported parcels, particularly those in the international mail stream, and recommending a new process which would deliver significant improvements and efficiencies in handling without creating delivery delays or other compliance difficulties for importers and consumers. 	Once an improved <b>international</b> <b>parcels</b> process has been designed, the Government should reassess {{the extent to which the}} LVT could be lowered while still remaining cost effective - the costs of raising this additional revenue should be at least broadly comparable to the costs of raising other taxes.

40|$|The Universal Postal Union was {{established}} in 1874 to regularize international mail procedures.

We find that a one day increase in international transport time uncertainty reduces bilateral trade flows by just over one percent. Splitting the sample into developing and developed countries shows that international transit time matters primarily for South-South trade, whereas uncertainty is relatively more important for North-North trade. Using new data on trade in intermediate versus final goods, we also find some evidence that time and uncertainty both matter more for movements of intermediates of the type that takes place within global value chains...|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} domestic parcel post service (a belated development, given that <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|R

Given the typical volumes of such businesses {{it is likely that}} this poses huge demands on the urban airspace in terms of capacity and conflict resolution. Current UTM concepts devise means to automatically detect and solve conflicts in smaller scales. However, it is yet unanswered to what degree a conflict-free operation of hundreds or thousands of drones occupying the same airspace is possible. In this paper we present a generic simulation framework that can load a given urban airspace with a specified demand or frequency of delivery drones. Based on actual street map data the user can specify a delivery area, a regular or randomized delivery schedule and a number of logistic centers to start from. Random destinations are then picked from the street maps and drones are scheduled to service these destinations. Further, the system analyzes the pre-planned drone schedule for conflicts and tries to resolve these conflicts without delaying individual drones too much. We detail statistics on how responsive the system is to adding tasks last-minute, and to unexpected events like emergency helicopters. The results give first insights, to what degree automatical de-conflicting solutions may work in urban areas...|$|R
