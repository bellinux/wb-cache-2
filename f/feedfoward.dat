5000|$|Connections {{lead from}} the {{cerebral}} cortex (including sensorimotor regions as well as cognitively relevant association areas and emotion-related limbic areas) to the cerebellum by a two-stage <b>feedfoward</b> system. The pathway starts in the layer V neurons of the cerebral cortex that project via the cerebral peduncle to the neurons of the anterior portion of the pons (the basis pontis). The pontine axons projects via the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle, terminating in the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. The feedback circuit from the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex is also a two-stage system. The cerebellar cortex projects to the deep cerebellar nuclei (the corticonuclear microcomplex). The deep nuclei then project to the thalamus, which in turn projects back to the cerebral cortex. [...] This cerebrocerebellar circuit is key to understanding the motor {{as well as the}} non-motor roles of the cerebellum. The relevant cognitive areas of the cerebral cortex that project to the cerebellum include the posterior parietal cortex (spatial awareness), the supramodal areas of the superior temporal gyrus (language), the posterior parahippocampal areas (spatial memory), the visual association areas in the parastriate cortices (higher-order visual processing), and the prefrontal cortex (complex reasoning, judgment attention, and working memory). There are also projections from the cingulate gyrus to the pons. [...] The organization of these anatomical pathways helps clarify the role the cerebellum plays in motor as well as non-motor functions. The cerebellum has also been shown to connect brainstem nuclei to the limbic system with implications for the function of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and the limbic system. [...] The connection with the limbic system presumably underlies the affective symptoms of CCAS.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a mathematical process {{model for the}} dynamic analysis of a vertical reheat boiler {{and the application of}} this model to the optimal design of a drum water level controller. A numerical finite difference technique is used to formulate this model. The control system contains two loops, a <b>feedfoward</b> loop using the steam flow and drum pressure signals as the input and a feedback loop using the deviation of the measured drum water level from its set point as an input. The feedback loop is an incremental PID controller with an adjustable proportional gain. The <b>feedfoward</b> loop is designed to directly actuate the control devices before the "swell" and "shrinkage" in the boiler water level occur. The feedforward controller output signal is summed along with the output of the PID controller to establish the set point for the control actuator. This scheme is effective because steam flow changes are immediately fed forward to change the final feedwater set point for the control actuator. In this way, feedwater flow tracks steam flow and any disturbances in the feedwater system will be arrested quickly. It is shown that an incremental PID controller plus adapt <b>feedfoward</b> compensator can be successfully employed for the control of water level in such a plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{structural}} changes (variations) {{play a central}} role in many scientific fields. One of the most current debates is about climatic changes. Further, politicians, environmentalists, scientists, etc. are involved in this debate and almost everyone is concerned with the consequences of climatic changes. However, in this thesis we will not move into the latter direction, i. e. the study of climatic changes. Instead, we consider models for analyzing changes in the dynamics of observed time series assuming these changes are driven by a non-observable stochastic process. To this end, we consider a first order stationary Markov Chain as hidden process and define the Generalized Mixture of AR-ARCH model(GMAR-ARCH) which is an extension of the classical ARCH model to suit to model with dynamical changes. For this model we provide sufficient conditions that ensure its geometric ergodic property. Further, we define a conditional likelihood given the hidden process and a pseudo conditional likelihood in turn. For the pseudo conditional likelihood we assume that at each time instant the autoregressive and volatility functions can be suitably approximated by given <b>Feedfoward</b> Networks. Under this setting the consistency of the parameter estimates is derived and versions of the well-known Expectation Maximization algorithm and Viterbi Algorithm are designed to solve the problem numerically. Moreover, considering the volatility functions to be constants, we establish the consistency of the autoregressive functions estimates given some parametric classes of functions in general and some classes of single layer <b>Feedfoward</b> Networks in particular. Beside this hidden Markov Driven model, we define as alternative a Weighted Least Squares for estimating the time of change and the autoregressive functions. For the latter formulation, we consider a mixture of independent nonlinear autoregressive processes and assume once more that the autoregressive functions can be approximated by given single layer <b>Feedfoward</b> Networks. We derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter estimates. Further, we prove the convergence of Backpropagation for this setting under some regularity assumptions. Last but not least, we consider a Mixture of Nonlinear autoregressive processes with only one abrupt unknown changepoint and design a statistical test that can validate such changes...|$|E

Previous {{studies have found that}} low and high spatial frequency information regarding object identity may be processed over different timescales. Here we used the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) combined with multivariate pattern analysis to measure information specifically related to object identity in peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas. Using stimuli closely matched in their low-level visual content, we found that activity in peri-occipital cortex could be used to decode object identity from ~ 80 ms post stimulus onset, and activity in peri-frontal cortex could also be used to decode object identity from a later time (~ 265 ms post stimulus onset). Low spatial frequency information related to object identity was present in the MEG signal at an earlier time than high spatial frequency information for peri-occipital cortex, but not for peri-frontal cortex. We additionally used Granger causality analysis to compare feedforward and feedback influences on representational content, and found evidence of both an early <b>feedfoward</b> flow and later feedback flow of information related to object identity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{theoretical}} description of standard <b>feedfoward</b> neural networks {{in terms of}} discrete affine wavelet transforms. This description aids in establishing a rigorous understanding {{of the behavior of}} feedforward neural networks based upon the properties of wavelet transforms. Time-frequency localization properties of wavelet transforms are shown to be crucial to our formulation. In addition to providing a solid mathematical foundation for feedforward neural networks, this theory may prove useful in explaining some of the empirically obtained results in the field of neural networks. Among the more practical implications of this work are the following: (1) Simple analysis of training data provides complete topological definition for a feedforward neural network. (2) Faster and more efficient learning algorithms are obtained by reducing the dimension of the parameter space in which interconnection weights are searched for. This reduction of the weight space is obtained via the same analysis used to configure the network. Global convergence of the iterative training procedure discussed here is assured. Moreover, it is possible to arrive at a non-iterative training procedure which involves solving a system of linear equations. (3) Every feedforward neural network constructed using our wavelet formulation is equivalent to a 'standard feedforward network. ' Hence properties of neural networks, which have prompted the study of VLSI implementation of such networks are retained...|$|E
