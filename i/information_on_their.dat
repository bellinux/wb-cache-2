5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, {{along with the}} comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Madonna faced {{a lawsuit}} in 2004 over an image in the book. Titled Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton, Madonna's former {{bodyguard}} and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on an incorrect photo caption. The photo had a caption identifying the subject in it as Albright; it was actually one of Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. Amarak Productions, Inc. had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her. While writing Madonna, Morton contacted Albright to gather <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected to the caption.|$|E

5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along with <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E
5|$|The Vs. Battle is the {{multiplayer}} mode {{where two}} to four players can compete simultaneously. Time Attack lets the player choose any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. An Internet ranking system was established where players enter a password on the official F-Zero website and get ranked based on {{their position in the}} database. Players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race, which records their time and machine used. Ghost data, transparent re-enactments of the player's Time Attack performances, can be saved on memory cards to later race against. Up to five ghosts can be raced against simultaneously. The Replay mode allows saved Grand Prix and Time Attack gameplay to be replayed with different camera angles and in-game music. The Pilot Profile mode has each character's biography, theme music, <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> machine, and a short full motion video sequence.|$|E

5|$|The first {{significant}} conflict involving the JNA in the Bjelovar area occurred on 1 September, when 14 JNA officers and soldiers were disarmed at a Croatian checkpoint. The {{commanding officer of}} the Bjelovar JNA garrison, Colonel Rajko Kovačević, demanded that the weapons to be returned, however the Croatian forces declined the request, claiming that the weapons had already been sent to Zagreb. Tensions greatly increased after 18 ZNG troops from the 105th Brigade, deployed from Bjelovar, went missing during the Battle of Kusonje on 9 September. The civilian authorities in the city demanded that the JNA provide <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fate, but the JNA declared it {{had no knowledge of}} the matter.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E
5|$|The list of {{threatened}} fauna of Michigan includes almost 400 endangered, threatened and special concern {{species that are}} located in Michigan {{as a part of}} the fauna of the United States. Endangered and threatened species in Michigan are protected through the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan, part of the 1994 Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. The list was last updated in 2009 to its sixth iteration. At this time, 69 new species were added, including many species of freshwater mussels and snails, and 13 species were removed. The state also recognizes species of special concern, which are not protected under the Act. These species have low or declining numbers in the state or a need for additional <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> populations in Michigan. If the species' numbers decline, they are moved to threatened or endangered status and afforded protection under the Act; if they increase, they are removed from the list without further action.|$|E

5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
