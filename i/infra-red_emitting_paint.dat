40|$|The rapid {{development}} of polymer and molecular-based {{light emitting diodes}} {{has resulted in a}} new generation of low cost displays currently entering the market place. The use of organolanthanide molecules as emitting centres in these devices was first suggested as a means of improving the colour purity of the emission utilising the sharp 4 f- 4 f transitions of the lanthanide ion. The energy transfer process involved in exciting the lanthanide ion however also increased the theoretical quantum efficiency from 25 %, typical for a conventional device, to 100 % due to the large spin-orbit coupling induced by the heavy ion. Despite this advantage the highest reported efficiency to date is 1. 4 %. More recently <b>infra-red</b> <b>emitting</b> organolanthanide based diodes have been demonstrated though again reported efficiencies are low.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of phosphor preparation methods was carried out. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence measurements {{were used to}} evaluate the methods. The most suitable for DC electroluminescence (DCEL) was found to be a thioacetamide synthesis. The DCEL forming process was investigated using Laser-Raman spectroscopy. This showed no changes in copper concentration in the formed layer of a DCEL device following the forming process, suggesting that the forming process may be due to oxidation. Indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive-coated plastic was used successfully as a replacement for ITO-coated glass in DCEL devices and methods were developed for the use of cross-linked linseed oil as a binder in DCEL panels, producing a very flexible phosphor/binder layer. The feasibility of producing <b>infra-red</b> <b>emitting</b> electroluminescent devices for particular applications was investigated. ZnCdS: Cu layers were incorporated into DCEL, and ACEL devices. The DCEL devices showed a strong photoelectric effect. The ACEL devices produced infra-red emission.

I compared {{the effect of}} various factors on the power density at catastrophic damage and found the greatest effect from the current pulse length and dot or well nature of the active region, {{for the first time}} in the AlGaInP material system. At short pulse length the quantum dot devices achieved a power density of 17 MW/cm 2 compared to 14 MW/cm 2 for quantum well lasers, and then proved by electron microscopy and photocurrent spectroscopy not to have reached their limit for mirror damage, but to have failed by other means. I observed the loss of optical power at catastrophic optical mirror damage in real time, applying single, very high current pulses, observing differences in the behaviour of quantum dot, which showed little or no facet damage, and quantum well devices, which showed large amounts of damage, with a resolution of tens of nanoseconds compared to microseconds in the literature.

40|$|Results {{obtained}} from measurements and spectroscopic analysis of current transients induced in almost ideal silicon n(+) - p junctions by infra-red stimulation n illuminating a reverse biased junction {{by means of}} an <b>infra-red</b> <b>emitting</b> diode for a few seconds, a current transient is generated which, at 0 degrees C, lasts several hours. This can be decomposed, by means of a proper spectroscopic method, into a sum of four exponential contributions with time constants ranging from tens up to thousands of seconds. Similar dark current transients were already obtained for the same junctions when they were stimulated by a change of the reverse bias voltage, without any optical excitation. The spectroscopy of both optical and voltage induced current transients gives four exponential components with the same time constants. Both the dark current and the photocurrent transients are ascribed to the same SiyOx clusters containing hundreds of Si atoms and four types of single energy level defect centers with different localization. While the voltage induced current transients implicate the activation of such defect centers in the p-region near the n(+) - p interface only, those due to the photostimulation produce their activation throughout the whole n(+) region as well. This fact leads to much greater values for the transient photocurrent in n comparison to those induced by voltage changes and, as a consequence, to greater reliability and accuracy in the measurements and in the results {{obtained from}} their analysis.

40|$|The {{construction}} of lanthanide(III) chelates that exhibit superior photophysical properties holds great importance in biological and materials science. One strategy {{to increase the}} luminescence properties of lanthanide(III) chelates is to hinder competitive non-radiative decay processes through perfluorination of the chelating ligands. Here, the synthesis of two families of heavily fluorinated lanthanide(III) β-diketonate complexes bearing monodentate perfluorinated tris phenyl phosphine oxide ligands have been prepared through a facile one pot reaction [Ln(hfac) 3 {(ArF) 3 PO}(H 2 O) ] and [Ln(F 7 -acac) 3 {(ArF) 3 PO} 2] (where Ln = Sm 3 +, Eu 3 +, Tb 3 +, Er 3 + and Yb 3 +). Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis in combination with photophysical studies have been performed to investigate the factors responsible for {{the differences in the}} luminescence lifetimes and intrinsic quantum yields of the complexes. Replacement of both bound H 2 O and C–H oscillators in the ligand backbone has a dramatic effect on the photophysical properties of the complexes, particularly for the near <b>infra-red</b> <b>emitting</b> ion Yb 3 +, where a five fold increase in luminescence lifetime and quantum yield is observed.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism at {{the origin of the}} <b>infra-red</b> radiation <b>emitted</b> by a biased tunnel junction by detecting photons at frequencies ν<eV/h. To address this regime, the bias voltage V exceeds one volt and the potential profile of the tunnel barrier is driven far from its equilibrium state.

At optical frequencies, the transport through the junction cannot be simply expressed in term of the dc current and the current fluctuations are no longer described by the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Taking into account the energy and voltage dependence of the transmission of the tunnel junction in a Landauer-Büttiker scattering approach, we experimentally demonstrate that the photon emission results from the fluctuations of the current inside the tunneling barrier.

The major volatile organic compounds in these paints were also identified. The time dependence of TVOC emissions from paint products in the chamber was evaluated. TVOC emissions from organic solvent-soluble and water-soluble paints were compared. The influence of air exchange rate on the TVOC concentrations emitted from organic solvent-soluble and water-soluble paints was also investigated. A double-exponential equation was used to evaluate emission characteristics of TVOC from paint products. With this double-exponential model, the physical processes of TVOC emissions can be explained.

40|$|Aims. Our {{aim is to}} gain new {{insights}} into highly ionized gas towards nearby hot white dwarfs (WDs). The detection of absorption lines of highly ionized interstellar (IS) species in their spectra is the main diagnostic tool of the hot IS gas phase. This requires disentangling IS ions from photospheric or circumstellar (CS) ions, and thus their simultaneous study. This is particularly timely due to the recent discovery of <b>infra-red</b> <b>emitting</b> disks around WDs and the recognition that accretion from those disks can explain the presence of photospheric heavy ions, thus opening the exciting prospect of measuring the composition of extra-solar disks and planetary systems. Methods. We present far UV spectra of three nearby white dwarfs recorded with the Cosmic Object Spectrograph on board the HST. Absorption lines of several ions at various ionization stages are detected, and we investigate their origin by means of their kinematical properties, in combination with previous measurements with the FUSE satellite. We supplement with these new results a large set of archival white dwarfs UV data and we analyze the line shifts. Results. Interstellar CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI ions are likely detected at distance from the Plane towards WD 1040 + 492 (230 pc), but within 100 parsecs there are no detections of IS ions. Small absorptions generated at cloud-hot gas interfaces may be present but are within our detection limit. The main result is the detection of the CIV, SiIV and NV counterparts to the redshifted OVI lines measured towards WD 2257 - 073 and WD 1040 + 492. Based on their velocities, they very likely trace absorbing circumstellar material, extending earlier results. More surprisingly, CS absorption is also detected at small redshift towards WD 1942 + 499, and potentially towards WD 2257 - 073. Comparisons of the COS CIII and CIV data with atmospheric models preclude a stellar origin for these features. We thus present first evidence for a temporal variability of the CS lines and for a case of double absorption. Overall these results demonstrate the ubiquity of CS absorptions and favor a large interval of CS line shifts. Based on the compilation of OVI, CIV, SiIV and NV data from IUE, FUSE, GHRS, STIS, and COS, we derive an anti-correlation between the stellar temperature and the high ion velocity shift w. r. t. to the photosphere, with positive (resp. negative) velocity shifts for the cooler (resp. hotter) white dwarfs. This trend probably reflects {{more than a single}} process, however such a dependence on the WD’s temperature again favors a CS origin for a very large fraction of those ion absorptions, and a form of balance between radiation pressure and gravitation. This is consistent with ubiquitous evaporation of orbiting dusty material. In view of these results, ion measurements close to the photospheric or the IS velocity should be interpreted with caution, especially for stars at intermediate temperatures. While tracing CS gas, they may be erroneously attributed to photospheric material or to the ISM, explaining the difficulty of finding a coherent pattern of the high ions in the local IS 3 D distribution. 5606...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of air traffic in the Asia Pacific region {{in the last decade}} has brought about the need for more {{sustainable}} modes of flight. A key initiative is the development of a Next Generation Air Traffic Management (NG-ATM) system which allows aircraft to fly optimal trajectories. Besides fuel- and time-related costs, other considerations for optimal routing include emissions, noise and contrails. Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimisation (MOTO) allows the generation of optimal trajectories with regards to these objectives, with dynamic weights depending on the phase of flight. Contrails are a major contributor to aviation&# 039;s total Radiative Forcing (RF), being more significant than that of CO 2. In particular, when formed in areas of low temperature and high relative humidity, contrails are known to persist for hours, spreading and eventually transitioning into cirrus clouds. Contrails trap heat by reflecting the long-wave <b>infra-red</b> radiation <b>emitted</b> by the earth back to its surface, producing positive RF. However, the albedo of contrails also reflects the incoming shortwave radiation from the sun, resulting in a negative component of RF. The impact of contrails, quantified by its associated RF, is thus not merely a function of environmental parameters but also a function of time. In this paper, a MOTO algorithm is used to generate optimal trajectories that minimize the radiative impact of contrails and CO 2, while minimizing flight time and fuel burn. A case study of a transcontinental flight from Paris to Beijing is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such an algorithm in providing strategic and tactical trajectory optimization capabilities...|$|R
50|$|As a photon {{is absorbed}} by an atom, it excites the atom, {{elevating}} an electron {{to a higher}} energy level (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called fluorescence, a type of photoluminescence. An example is visible light <b>emitted</b> from fluorescent <b>paints,</b> in response to ultraviolet (blacklight).

Proce differences between labelled and competing non-labelled products should be moderate, as in general the willingness to pay more for an environmentally friendly product is not pronounced.

40|$|Opto-electronic devices {{operating}} as radiation detectors in the infra-red {{region of the}} electromagnetic spectrum are currently of interest. By operating in the infra-red, particularly in the 8 - 12 µm wavelength range, it is possible to detect the <b>infra-red</b> radiation <b>emitted</b> by objects at ordinary temperatures and so to image in darkness. Furthermore, at such wavelengths, vision is also possible in mist, fog or smoke. Semiconducting materials which have an energy gap corresponding to the photon energy of the radiation of interest are suitable for fabricating such devices. The growth and characterisation of two such materials both formed from elements in groups IIB and VIA of the periodic table and generally refered to as II-VI compounds, forms the subject matter of this thesis. The first of these materials is the ternary compound mercury cadmium telluride ((Hg,Cd) Te). This is a well established infra-red material and was grown for this work in thin film form by Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) using the Inter- diffused Multilayer Process (IMP). The resulting layers were characterised optically and electrically and were shown to be of excellent compositional uniformity, an important consideration for infra-red devices, but to contain extremely high acceptor concentrations in the as grown state. These high acceptor concentrations were attributed to mercury vacancies present due to the inherent weakness of the material. Fitting of the electrical data obtained from p-type samples using a multicarrier/multilayer transport model suggested that the mercury vacancy concentrations were also highly non-uniform. A more novel alternative to (Hg(_ 1) Cd) Te is the HgTe:ZnTe superlattice system. By forming a superlattice from the two constituent binary compounds, rather than alloy, quantum confinement and strain effects may, in principle, be used to tailor the optical and electronic properties to some extent independently of the composition. The resulting material may also be structurally more stable than an equivalent alloy. Here the development of a thermal MOVPE growth process for this superlattice system is described and it is shown that such superlattices may be preferable to the equivalent alloys as they are easier to grow by MOVPE. Initial structural and optical studies and theoretical calculations have confirmed the suitability of MOVPE for the growth of this superlattice system and its applicability for infra-red applications...|$|R

The results of these investigations showed that the combustion flame light emissions were strongly influenced by the ignition advance setting and they could be expected to form a suitable input to a spark advance control system. An electronic knock detection system was constructed using the light emissions intensity as the criteria for determining whether knocking combustion was occurring. The system proved capable of resolving the ignition advance to within 2 ° crankangle of the limit for knock. Further testing was completed in order to determine how the combustion product buildup on the inner glass surface would affect the light transmitted to the photo-detectors over a long period of engine operation. The photo-detectors were able to respond to the light levels transmitted through the glass for medium periods of engine operation (up to 100 hours). Finally, guidelines are given for further work in this field...|$|R
40|$|Iso {{propyl alcohol}} (IPA) is a toxic {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) that is <b>emitted</b> from various <b>paint,</b> pharmaceutical, lithography, and rubber manufacture industries. These emissions may lead to an adverse effect on air quality and thus endanger public health and welfare. The most serious requirements for removing VOCs from waste gases in recent years necessitate the development of innovative and cost-effective treatment alternatives. The aerobic biodegradation of IPA by an acclimated mixed culture obtained by sewage treatment plant is carried out in this study for the range of 200 – 700 mg/L of initial IPA concentration. Substrate inhibition occurred for more than 300 mg/L of IPA concentration. The results obtained in present study are fitted with the Haldane model with coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 989). The biodegradation rate kinetic parameters Isopropyl Alcohal (IPA) is one such VOC having a boiling point of 83 0 C, which vaporizes at normal atmospheric conditions. It is flammable, clear, colorless liquid and is slightly odorous. IPA has wide applications as a solvent in paint, pharmaceutical, lithography, and rubber manufacture industries.

40|$|Alkyd <b>paints</b> <b>emit</b> over {{a period}} of several weeks after {{application}} under normal conditions (room temperature and relative humidity of 50 %) substances which have a negative impact on the Indoor Air Quality. In the present work, fast and robust methods for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the VOC - emitter (hexanal and caproic acid) during the drying of alkyd paints were developed. For this test, a so called "test chamber"' (according to the AgBB scheme) and a micro - chamber from Markes were used. In addition, the distribution - and diffusion coefficients of the emitters formed in situ were determined, to get a competent knowledge of their emission rates and thereby an improved interpretation of the emission profiles. The diffusion coefficient was determined in a static and dynamic system with the help of a new application and manufacturing method of the coating samples. Furthermore, a physicochemical approach was used to reduce the solubility of hexanal in the coating matrix. The dwell time of hexanal in the paint matrix is reduced and thus less hexanal is autoxidized to caproic acid. According to this, the contamination of indoor air by the drying of alkyd resin is lowered...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the energy balance of the earth's surface with a special {{emphasis}} on practical applications. A simple picture of the energy exchange processes that take place at the ground is the following. Per unit time and area an amount of radiant energy is supplied to the surface. This radiation originates partly from the sun, but an~ other fraction is coming from the atmosphere (= <b>infra-red</b> radiation <b>emitted</b> by clouds, water vapour and CO 2 ). From these gain terms the following losses must be subtracted: (a) the reflected solar radiation and (b) the <b>infra-red</b> radiation <b>emitted</b> by the surface itself. The final result is that a net amount of radiant energy is received by the surface, simply denoted as net radiation. At the ground net radiation is used to heat the ground (soil heat flux), to evaporate liquid water (evaporation), and to heat the atmosphere (sensible heat flux). In this simple picture we have neglected minor terms such as the energy used by the plants for their photosynthesis. Due to the high value of the latent heat of vaporization, the energy needed for evaporation is often an important term in the energy balance. In addition the energy balance of the earth's surface is linked with the water budget of both the atmosphere and the earth's surface, through the evaporation at the ground. Several practical questions in agriculture, hydrology and meteorology require information m the energy balance of the surface. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to find solutions for some of these problems. In hydrology one is mainly concerned in evaporation averaged over 1 day or more on a regional scale. Generally, this refers to land surfaces, but the evaporation of inland lakes or reservoirs is also of interest. In this context we also mention the problem of thermal pollution of open water bodies by industry or power plants. For this the so-called natural water temperature must be known, which is the temperature of the water in the hypothetical case that there is no artificial heating. It appears that this temperature depends mainly m the energy balance at the surface. In Chapter VI a model dealing with this problem is discussed. In agriculture one is interested also in evaporation. Now time intervals ranging from half an hour to several days are of interest. The relation between evaporation an the one side and plant diseases and pest control an the other can be mentioned. Furthermore, the yield of several agricultural crops is the greatest when the evapotranspiration is potential (= a maximum under the given weather conditions). When the crop transpires less than the potential rate, because the soil is too dry, the yield can be augmented by artificial precipitation. For applications such as these cheap and simple techniques are required for measuring the actual and potential evaporation. This applies also to agricultural research projects, e. g. to determine yield-water use relationships. In Chapter II simple measurement techniques are considered. Recent developments in meteorology have led to an increase of the interest in the energy balance of the earth's surface, especially in the input of heat and humidity at ground level into the atmosphere. Examples are models for the atmospheric boundary layer and related models for short range weather forecasts (12 - 18 h ahead). These models require simple parameterizations of the surface fluxes. This applies also to weather forecast models on a medium time range (3 - 10 days ahead). Since the height of the boundary layer is related to the heat input at the ground information an the surface energy balance is needed also for air pollution problems. In Chapter III a simple parameterization for evaporation and sensible heat flux is described that can be used for these type of problems. Usually, the only available data are standard weather observations. For that reason, many of the practical questions, mentioned above, can be formulated as: "How can the surface energy balance be estimated from standard weather data only'?" In Chapters III and VI possible answers to that question are discussed. Chapter II {{is devoted to}} simple measuring techniques that, in principle, can be used on an operational base. These methods will be compared with the so-called energy-balance method, using Bowen's ratio. In Chapter III two models for evaporation and sensible heat flux during daytime are compared. Both require standard weather data as input and an indication of the surface wetness. The first model needs more data, but contains more physics. The second is less complete, but requires less input data. Chapter IV has a mainly theoretical character. A model is presented that couples the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer to the surface energy balance. It describes the course of the height, temperature and humidity of the boundary layer, together with the surface fluxes, when the initial profiles of temperature and humidity the radiative forcing and the surface wetness are known. It is restricted to convective conditions. Model output will be compared with observations. In Chapter V an empirical evaporation model for open water is considered. Comparisons with observations of evaporation of the former Lake Flevo will be made; the annual and the diurnal cycle will be considered. In Chapter VI a model for the (natural) temperature and energy balance of inland lakes and water reservoirs is discussed that requires standard weather data only. A comparison between the calculated and measured water temperature will be given. This concerns two adjacent water reservoirs, which have about the same size, but which differ in depth (5 and 15 m). This is of importance, since the water temperature also depends on water depth. At some places we made new modifications, but most of the theoretical concepts applied in this study are adopted from literature. This is inherent in our practical approach. Some of the theories used have been available for many years. But, e. g. because no suitable instruments were available, they were not usefull for practical applications. Recent developments in the field of instrumentation and data handling have changed the situation-to our advantage. A good example is the temperature fluctuation method for measuring the sensible heat flux (discussed in 11. 4). The theoretical basis for this approach was given by Prandtl already in 1932. But for an experimental verification we had to wait until the sixties and early seventies. In that period instruments were developed to measure turbulent surface fluxes and fast temperature fluctuations, while also the data handling techniques were improved significantly. Finally) the method wouldn't be operationally until quite recently. For the verification of the parameterizations, measuring techniques and models treated in this study, we used data collected at the 200 m mast at Cabauw, and at the nearby micrometeorological field, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute...|$|R
40|$|Phosphor {{thermometry}} {{has been}} used for many years for non-contact temperature measurements in hostile environments. Aerospace systems are particularly prone to adverse high temperature environments, including large blackbody background, vibration, rotation, fire/flame, pressure, or noise. These environments often restrict the use of more common thermocouples or infrared thermometric techniques. Temperature measurements inside jet turbines, rocket engines, or similar devices are especially amenable to fluorescence techniques. Often the phosphor powders are suspended in binders and applied like paint or applied as high temperature sprays. Thin coatings will quickly assume the same temperature as the surface to which they are applied. The temperature dependence of phosphors {{is a function of the}} base matrix atoms and a small quantity of added activator or “dopant ” ions. Often for high temperature applications, the selected materials are refractory and include rare earth ions. Phosphors like Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) doped with Eu, Dy, or Tm, Y 2 O 3 doped with Eu, or similar rare earth compounds, will survive high temperatures and can be configured to emit light that changes rapidly in lifetime and intensity. Recently, a YAG:Cr phosphor <b>paint</b> <b>emitted</b> fluorescence during short duration tests in a high Mach number hydrogen flame at 2, 200 °C.
