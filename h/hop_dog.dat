Although correlative evidence supports several linkage mechanisms, mechanical links contribute < 20 % of the tidal volume in exercising animals. Observations of consistent integer relationships between breathing and stride cycles in exercising birds and mammals date from Marey's observations in the last century. The tight temporal correlation between locomotor and respiratory cycles in animals such as <b>hopping</b> wallabies, galloping <b>dogs</b> and horses, and flying bats has led investigators to propose that during locomotion, muscles of exercising limbs provide {{some or all of the}} work of breathing.
