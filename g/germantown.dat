5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, the PRR station {{was known as}} <b>Germantown</b> Junction, while the Reading had its 16th Street station a block to the {{northwest}} (and after 1890, Huntingdon Street station to the southeast). <b>Germantown</b> Junction station was a two-story Queen Anne style building located between the diverging lines; its large gables acted as shelters for passengers.|$|E
5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at <b>Germantown.</b> Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at <b>Germantown,</b> and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of <b>Germantown.</b> Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Holbrook was {{originally}} named <b>Germantown</b> after these settlers until changing its name in 1914 {{as a result}} of tensions caused by World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Rockville Pike {{portion of}} MD 355 {{dates back to}} colonial times and {{was used as an}} escape route from Washington during the War of 1812 as well as a route for {{settlers}} to travel from Montgomery County to developing areas north and west. In 1911, a small portion of state highway leading northwest out of Rockville was completed, with the remainder between Rockville and Gaithersburg under contract. A state highway was proposed between Gaithersburg and <b>Germantown.</b> The state road between Gaithersburg and <b>Germantown</b> was finished by 1915. By 1921, the portions of state highway between the Washington, D.C. border and Rockville, to the northwest of <b>Germantown,</b> and between northwest of Urbana and Frederick were completed. At this time, a state highway was proposed between northwest of <b>Germantown</b> and northwest of Urbana. The state road was completed between <b>Germantown</b> and Clarksburg and through Urbana to a point southeast of the community by 1923. The entire length of the state road connecting Washington, D.C. and Frederick was completed by 1927. In the approved plan for the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 240 was planned to run from Washington, D.C. to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania via Frederick. In 1927, US 240 was designated along the proposed 1926 route south of US 15/US 40 in Frederick with the US 15 designation given to the road north of Frederick. In 1950, US 240 was widened into a divided highway between the Washington, D.C. border and Bethesda.|$|E
5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced {{them back to the}} early 17th century. Thereupon Johann Peter Rockenfeller (baptized 27 September 1682 in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a {{district}} of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America and settled down in <b>Germantown,</b> Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Gasol's mother, Marisa, was {{a medical}} doctor, and his father, Agustí, {{was a nurse}} administrator. When Pau was born, his family was living in Cornellà, but {{he was born in}} Barcelona, at Sant Pau Hospital, where both of his parents worked. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to another Barcelona suburb, Sant Boi de Llobregat, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his childhood. His parents moved to the Memphis suburb of <b>Germantown,</b> Tennessee, after he signed with the Grizzlies, and enrolled his younger brothers Marc and Adrià in Lausanne Collegiate School in Memphis. They planned to move to the Los Angeles area when Pau was traded to the Lakers, with Agustí accepting a job with a health-care company in that area; although the Grizzlies obtained the rights to Marc's services as part of the trade, he was expected to re-sign with his Spanish team Akasvayu Girona. However, when Marc decided to sign with the Grizzlies, their parents chose to stay in <b>Germantown.</b> Agustí now works from home for the same company, while Marisa now volunteers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.|$|E
5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century. They were particularly attracted by William Penn's promise {{of religious freedom}} in the colony of Pennsylvania, {{and came to the}} Philadelphia region in significant numbers. By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as <b>Germantown</b> (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia). Many of these immigrants brought with them their Lutheran faith and formed congregations in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{plans were}} made to {{construct}} a freeway, the Washington National Pike (now I-270), parallel to US 240. In 1953, the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 (now MD 85) in Frederick. The former alignment of US 240 between Clarksburg and Frederick was designated as US 240 Alt. A year later, the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in <b>Germantown.</b> At this time, the original alignment between <b>Germantown</b> and Frederick was designated MD 355, replacing what was US 240 between <b>Germantown</b> and Clarksburg and {{the entire length of}} US 240 Alt. between Clarksburg and Frederick. The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956, and MD 355 was subsequently extended south along the former alignment to the MD 28 intersection in Rockville. Also, the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40. In 1957, US 240 was upgraded to a divided highway between Bethesda and Rockville. The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958, resulting in MD 355 being extended south along the former alignment to Montrose Road. I-70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959. In addition, MD 355 was extended north to US 15 north of Frederick, passing through the city on Market Street, the one-way pair of Market Street northbound and Bentz Street southbound in the downtown, and Market Street to the north of downtown. The route replaced US 15/US 240 south of downtown Fredrick and US 15 north of downtown Frederick, with US 15 shifted to a bypass west of the city. In 1960, I-70S/US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway, and MD 355 was extended south along former US 240 between Montrose Road and the Capital Beltway.|$|E
5|$|In June 1945, Westcott {{became an}} Army {{employee}} again, {{and in the}} post-war years he transitioned to employment with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) after its formation in 1946. In 1966 {{he was assigned to}} the AEC headquarters near Washington, DC, in <b>Germantown,</b> Maryland, where he worked for the AEC and its successor agencies (the Energy Research and Development Administration and Department of Energy) until retiring in 1977. He photographed nuclear power stations all over the United States.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1776, Morris {{completed}} {{his commitment to}} the Connecticut militia and immediately accepted a commission in the Continental Army as a first lieutenant. After serving as a recruiting officer in Litchfield, Morris joined General George Washington and the army at Peekskill. On October 3, 1776, General Washington commanded this army in the Battle of <b>Germantown.</b> The American forces were ultimately unsuccessful in this battle and Morris was taken as a prisoner of war on October 4, 1776.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has been}} {{recorded}} about Redheffer's life, other than his connection to the hoax.

5|$|MD 355 {{is a part}} of {{the main}} National Highway System from the District of Columbia in Friendship Heights to I-495 in Bethesda. The highway is also a part of the National Highway System as an {{intermodal}} connector from I-495 to Shady Grove Road in Rockville and as a principal arterial from Shady Grove Road to MD 27 in <b>Germantown.</b>|$|E
5|$|Previous PRR {{stations}} were generally in the picturesque eclectic style common among 19th century railroads stations, like the Victorian eclectic Overbrook {{station and the}} Furness-style Broad Street Station. <b>Germantown</b> Junction was the first station along the Northeast Corridor to be constructed in the Châteauesque style, and it ushered in the Beaux Arts style used by the Pennsylvania and other railroads during the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City. In 1795, he moved to <b>Germantown,</b> Pennsylvania, near (and now part of) Philadelphia, where he opened a studio. It was here that he gained {{a foothold in the}} art world and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|After the Valley Forge {{interchange}} {{the turnpike}} is designated as I-276 {{and becomes a}} six-lane road serving as a suburban commuter highway, crossing the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill River Bridge near Norristown. In Plymouth Meeting, an interchange with <b>Germantown</b> Pike provides access to Norristown before the roadway reaches the Mid-County Interchange. This interchange connects to I-476, which heads south as the Blue Route and north as the Northeast Extension of the turnpike; connecting the mainline turnpike to the Lehigh Valley and the Pocono Mountains.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British garrison at <b>Germantown</b> in early October. Meanwhile, to the north, Burgoyne {{was beyond the}} reach of help from Howe, trapped and forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War into a major worldwide affair.|$|E
5|$|Born in Litchfield County, Connecticut, James Morris {{spent his}} early life hoping and {{training}} to be a minister. However, after graduating from Yale College, Morris accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence. Morris was captured during the Battle of <b>Germantown</b> {{and spent most of}} the remaining war in captivity. Upon his release, Morris was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported Alexander Hamilton in the Siege of Yorktown. When he returned from the war, Morris began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together, a rarity at the time.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{was born}} to Tom and Dolores Cain in Dothan, Alabama. He lived in Vincent, Alabama, for a year when his mother taught at a school nearby. Cain also spent part of his {{childhood}} in <b>Germantown,</b> Tennessee, where he attended Houston High School. He took lessons on how to pitch from Mauro Gozzo, who lived near the Cains in Tennessee. As a senior at Houston High School, Cain struck out 83 batters in 62 innings pitched while recording a 1.03 earned run average (ERA).|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, <b>Germantown,</b> Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|In 1777 {{all three}} units {{participated in the}} Philadelphia campaign, {{taking part in the}} Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Paoli and the Battle of <b>Germantown.</b> Remaining in Philadelphia over the winter and into 1778, the 64th and 2nd Grenadier Battalion formed part of the rearguard when Lieutenant-General Clinton {{evacuated}} the city in June 1778. Returning to New York, the 64th took part in several small operations. The Light company took part in the skirmish that became known as the Baylor Massacre.|$|E
5|$|Mid-19th century Navajo rugs {{often used}} a three-ply yarn called Saxony, {{which refers to}} high-quality, {{naturally}} dyed, silky yarns. Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England. With {{the arrival of the}} railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as <b>Germantown</b> because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Several {{regional}} university stadiums {{have been}} used by the team for Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup matches, including Klöckner Stadium in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1996, and George Mason Stadium in Fairfax, Virginia in 2010. Similarly, the team has also used the Maryland SoccerPlex in <b>Germantown,</b> Maryland for multiple early-round games in U.S. Open Cup and CONCACAF Champions' Cup since it opened in 2001. Exhibition games, as well as occasional regular season matches, have also been played in nearby FedExField in Landover, Maryland; the latter have generally been played as part of doubleheaders featuring friendlies between national teams or foreign clubs.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Canadian Regiment, {{also known}} as Congress' Own or Hazen's Regiment, was {{authorized}} on January 20, 1776, as an Extra Continental regiment {{and raised in the}} province of Quebec for service with the Continental Army under the command of Colonel Moses Hazen. All or part of the regiment saw action at Staten Island, Brandywine, <b>Germantown</b> and the Siege of Yorktown. Most of its non-combat time was spent in and around New York City as part of the forces monitoring the British forces occupying that city. The regiment was disbanded on November 15, 1783, at West Point, New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was part}} of the platoon of the advance party that first entered <b>Germantown</b> before the battle became general. Unbeknownst to Washington, the columns of Greene and Smallwood got lost. Washington himself accompanied Sullivan's force and, at 5am, ordered him to launch the assault. The leading element of Sullivan's column, General Thomas Conway's brigade, attacked the British 2d Light Infantry battalion, which had been reinforced by the British 40th Regiment of Foot under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Musgrave. The regiment formed part of Sullivan's early attack on the British; its losses were 3 officers and 19 men.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and <b>Germantown</b> Junction. A new station, which ushered in the Beaux-Arts style for large train stations, was built from 1896 to 1901. After a 1912–1915 enlargement, it was renamed as North Philadelphia. Despite several other renovations, its use {{declined}} in the mid and late 20th century; in 1991, Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks. The building was renovated once more in 1999 and is now used as commercial space. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places the same year.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} <b>Germantown</b> Pike, PA 363 becomes {{known as}} Valley Forge Road and continues into agricultural areas with scattered residential neighborhoods. The amount of development increases until the road {{comes to the}} junction with PA 73 (Skippack Pike) {{in the community of}} Worcester. After the PA 73 intersection, PA 363 continues past areas of housing developments to the west and farmland to the east before it reaches Morris Road. At this point, the route becomes the border between Towamencin Township to the northwest and Upper Gwynedd Township to the southeast, crossing under I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|Constance Dallas, {{the first}} woman to win {{election}} to City Council, was elected in a close vote in the 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, <b>Germantown,</b> and Roxborough) over incumbent councilman Robert S. Hamilton. In the 1st district, which took in South Philadelphia, attorney Thomas I. Guerin defeated Dominic J. Colubiale. In the 2nd, the Republicans' lone district-level victory came as electrical equipment salesman William M. Phillips bested Louis Vignola, a labor union official. In the 3rd district, made up of the southern half of West Philadelphia, incumbent Harry Norwitch defeated another incumbent from the old city council, George Maxman, who had held office since 1936. In the 4th, which covered the northern half of West Philadelphia, state representative Samuel Rose defeated incumbent James G. Clark.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, <b>Germantown,</b> and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|Most {{members of}} the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, however, were not chosen for the Rifle Corps and {{remained}} with the Main Army. The Marylanders in Smith's composite company served with the 11th Virginia Regiment in the 3rd Virginia Brigade at the Battles of Brandywine and <b>Germantown,</b> {{as well as at}} the Battle of Monmouth after they were administratively attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment of the 2nd Maryland Brigade at the end of the 1777 campaign season. The Virginians in Long's composite company remained attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment and fought at the same engagements in 1777 and 1778. Lt. (later Capt.) Philip Slaughter was the acting commander of the company during Long's nearly two-year attachment to the Rifle Corps and its permanent commander after Long's resignation.|$|E
5|$|Past US 1, I-476 {{continues}} through wooded suburban areas and interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 3 in Broomall, where it widens to six lanes. The route continues to Radnor Township, on the Main Line, where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30. Stone monuments, including a large stone cairn atop {{a hill and}} a large crushed-stone image of a mythological griffin on a hillside, were constructed at the Route 30 interchange to commemorate Radnor's history {{as part of the}} Welsh Tract. Proceeding northward, the route enters Montgomery County and comes to an interchange with Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) at West Conshohocken. After crossing the Schuylkill River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, the freeway heads into Plymouth Township, where it interchanges with Ridge Pike and <b>Germantown</b> Pike before coming to the Mid-County Interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. The entire length of the Blue Route is designated the Blue Route Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1918, the son of Henry Washington Sawyer II and his wife, Helen Curet Sawyer. Although he was a Quaker, Sawyer's family had a {{tradition}} of military service dating to the Civil War when his immigrant grandfather, the first Henry Washington Sawyer, served in the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry. After the war, Sawyer's grandfather became {{the owner of the}} Chalfonte Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey. Sawyer's father, Henry Sawyer II, died in the 1918 flu pandemic two months before his son was born, and Sawyer was raised by his mother, a school teacher, in Philadelphia's <b>Germantown</b> neighborhood. He attended high school at Chestnut Hill Academy, graduating in 1936. After graduation, Sawyer enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) where he wrote for The Daily Pennsylvanian, joined the Zeta Psi fraternity, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) baby shower, her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken), invites {{a woman named}} Lizzy Gill to help Scully around her apartment. Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill tampers with her pregnancy medications. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied with the research conducted at Zeus Genetics in <b>Germantown,</b> kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. All of the evidence at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire at Zeus Genetics, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Dr. Lev is connected to Scully's former obstetrician, Dr. Parenti. While searching Dr. Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses. They confront Dr. Parenti, who denies everything.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was born}} Constance Hopkins Snow on April 28, 1902, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, the {{daughter}} of Henry Sanger Snow and Anna LeConte Brooks. Henry Snow was a lawyer who worked as the treasurer of the New York & New Jersey Telephone Сompany. Brooks was originally from Philadelphia, {{the daughter of}} inventor David Brooks, and had {{served as president of}} the Daughters of the American Revolution. Constance was the youngest of the Snow children, born when her mother was forty-seven years old. She had three older siblings: Marion, Edward, and Anna. After Henry Snow was indicted for grand larceny concerning his former employers in 1908, he fled the city, leaving his family destitute. With some financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie, a friend of David Brooks, the family moved to Europe, where accommodations were cheaper and the family could be free of the stigma of Henry's crimes. While there, Constance was educated in convent schools in Belgium. When the family returned to the United States, they settled in Philadelphia and Snow attended <b>Germantown</b> Friends School. She later studied nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, and she served in the Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In late May Philadelphia {{hosted the}} Middle States tournament at its <b>Germantown</b> Cricket Club; Cochet {{advanced}} to the semifinal where Tilden's superiority proved to be his undoing. Cochet then sailed home to France and consequently missed the US Pro Tennis Championships. He chose instead to gather money in exhibition matches in Havana, Haiti, and Martinique on his way home. In France the official tour continued in Bayonne in August, where Cochet dropped his two singles matches to Tilden and Keith Gledhill {{in front of a}} home crowd. A Marseilles team event was scheduled in September where Cochet lost to Tilden, equalized against Gledhill and lost again in the doubles with Plaa to the Americans, who took the final victory as well. Two weeks later in a single-elimination tournament at Cochet's native Lyon Football Club he almost delighted the crowd with home victory but Tilden stole the second and third set to spoil the feat. Cochet subsequently suffered from an illness and missed the following events. Throughout the season Cochet earned a total of $17.381.|$|E
5|$|PA 97 {{begins at}} the Maryland state line in Germany Township. The highway {{continues}} south as MD 97 (Littlestown Pike) toward Westminster. PA 97 heads northwest along two-lane Baltimore Pike. The highway crosses Piney Creek and enters the borough of Littlestown, through which the highway follows Queen Street. PA 97 intersects PA 194 (King Street) {{in the center of}} town. The state highway becomes Baltimore Pike again on leaving Littlestown and re-entering Germany Township. PA 97 crosses Alloway Creek into Mount Joy Township. The highway crosses Plum Creek east of the hamlet of <b>Germantown</b> and Littles Run within Two Taverns. PA 97 widens to a four-lane divided highway at its crossing of Plum Run just south of Lake Heritage, which is also the name of the surrounding residential development. The state highway passes north of The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg and reaches its northern terminus at its diamond interchange with US 15. Baltimore Pike continues northwest through the Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District toward the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center, Evergreen Cemetery, several units of Gettysburg National Military Park, and the borough of Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} a {{permanent}} capital for the United States was discussed numerous times during the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, however, the Continental Congress could never agree on a site due to regional loyalties and tensions. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation selected New York City as the nation's temporary capital under the incoming federal government. The framers of the Constitution granted the new U.S. Congress exclusive governing jurisdiction over a federal district, intentionally separate from not beholden to any state. The Constitution, however, said nothing about where it would be. Discussions during the 1st Congress about where to locate the permanent seat of government revolved around two locations: one site on the Potomac River near Georgetown; and another site on the Susquehanna River near Wrights Ferry (now Columbia, Pennsylvania). The Susquehanna River site {{was approved by the}} House in September 1789, while legislation under consideration in the Senate specified a site on the Delaware River near <b>Germantown,</b> Pennsylvania. No agreement was reached, and the subject was deferred until the second session.|$|E
