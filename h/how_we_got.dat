John Anderson's independent candidacy, aimed at eliciting support from liberals, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan, especially in such reliably Democratic states such as Massachusetts and New York.|$|E

500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} George Stade {{said that}} Shikasta [...] "forces {{us to think}} about... what we are, <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with [...] "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on [...] "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations". When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, {{but it is not}} their fault. While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said [...] "have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts", he [...] "disapprove" [...] of the novel as a whole, but added, [...] "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".|$|E

It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> from here to there." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{stated in}} 1985 {{that if the}} limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would {{possibly}} create a 12-issue prequel series called Minutemen featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as Rorschach's Journal or The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary, as well as hinting {{at the possibility of}} other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because The 'Nam was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a [...] "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" [...] (in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted {{to the idea of a}} Minutemen series, because it would have [...] " [...] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the conclusion." ...|$|E

500|$|Mac Sledge finds {{redemption}} {{largely through}} his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This {{is in keeping}} with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told The New York Times that she [...] "kept me goin'. She never lost faith, and that's a rare thing. I don't know now <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through it, but we got through it." [...] The lyrics of [...] "If You'll Hold the Ladder", which Mac performs with his new country band {{in the second half of}} the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa's love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott's songs, such as those of [...] "The Best Bedroom in Town": [...] "The best part of all / the room at the end of the hall / That's where you and me make everything alright ... We celebrate the happiness we've found / Every night in the best bedroom in town". His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me". In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman's role in domestic life—although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that Tender Mercies embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.|$|E

He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. Sanders voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, Sanders stated: [...] "The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President." ...|$|E

[...] NDP MP Fin Donnelly was accused of using the tragic event as a means to garner votes, because he initially told reporters that he had personally handed a letter to Immigration Minister Chris Alexander urging the minister to look at the refugee application of Alan Kurdi's family, but that Canadian immigration authorities denied the family's application. However, later the aunt of Alan Kurdi revealed that the application was made only for Kurdi's uncle and was rejected because it was not complete. Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office clarified that they had not received the proper documentation to certify refugee status for the uncle's family. Mulcair later defended Donnelly, saying that no apology was warranted because the letter had mentioned both families, and stated that he [...] "couldn’t be prouder to have someone of the strength, integrity and hard work as Fin Donnelly" [...] in caucus.|$|E
2500|$|After Britain {{declared}} war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother relocated her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the First World War, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem {{under the tutelage of}} Winja Marova, becoming her [...] "star pupil". After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an [...] "English-sounding" [...] name was considered dangerous during the German occupation. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that [...] "had we known {{that we were going to}} be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over next week ... six months ... next year ... that's <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through". In 1942, her uncle, Otto van Limburg Stirum (husband of her mother's older sister, Miesje), was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family's prominence in Dutch society. Hepburn's half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German labour camp, and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.|$|E
