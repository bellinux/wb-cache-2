40|$|Providers of {{payloads}} carried {{aboard the}} International Space Station must conduct analyses {{to demonstrate that}} any planned gaseous venting events generate {{no more than a}} certain level of material that may interfere with optical measurements from other experiments or payloads located nearby. This requirement is expressed in terms of a maximum column number density (CND). Depending on the level of rarefaction, such venting may be characterized by effusion for low flow rates, or by a sonic distribution at higher levels. Since the relative locations of other sensitive payloads are often unknown because they may refer to future projects, this requirement becomes a search for the maximum CND along any path. In another application, certain astronomical observations make use of CND to estimate light attenuation from a distant star through gaseous plumes, such as the Fermi Bubbles emanating from the vicinity of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, in order to infer the amount of material being expelled via those plumes. This paper presents analytical CND expressions developed for general straight paths based upon a free molecule point source model for steady <b>effusive</b> <b>flow</b> and for a distribution fitted to model flows from a sonic orifice. Among other things, in this Mach number range it is demonstrated that the maximum CND from a distant location occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis.

40|$|This report {{documents}} efforts devoted {{towards the}} technical realization of a clean UHV-compatible oxygen atom {{source for the}} investigation of surface reactions. The {{first part of the}} paper consists of {{a review of the literature}} on the subject of generation and detection schemes of O atoms. The most encouraging technique for the above purpose is the generation of atoms by a microwave plasma discharge in molecular oxygen. A test discharge-tube made of quartz mounted in a HV vessel is described. It allows detection of O atoms by a modification of the well established titration method; i. e., relative concentrations of the atoms are measured via the chemiluminescence of NO_ 2 in reaction with NO. This is achieved in connection with two-dimensional CCD imaging. Furthermore, the <b>effusive</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics of the nozzle can be visualized using this approach. By varying the location of the microwave cavity, the wall recombination coefficients of O atoms on quartz are measured to 1. 10 "-" 4 and compared with literature data. In addition, the temperature dependence of O atom recombination has been determined by using a heatable pyrex reactor. Based on these measurements, a new type of discharge-tube has been constructed out of quartz which is based on the expansion of the atoms through a nozzle orifice of 0. 1 mm diameter. This allows operation at very low flows of molecular oxygen, making the design compatible with pumping capabilities of standard UHV apparatus. The degree of dissociation was determined by mass spectrometric measurements. A typical value of close to 30 % was measured for the dgree of dissociation at total flows of oxygen between 0. 01 and 0. 05 sccm. (orig.)

40|$|The {{evolution}} of rainfall-concurrent dome collapses at Soufrière Hills volcano is followed using a limit equilibrium model for rain infiltration {{into a hot}} lava carapace. Magma infusing into the dome both supplies heat and builds the slopes. The dome rocks are cooled by episodic rain infiltration and climatic cooling. Rainfall infiltrates fractures that develop in the hot dome carapace, occludes the void space, and staunches <b>effusive</b> gas <b>flow.</b> Gases may originate from juvenile de-gassing of the dome interior, or result from the vaporization of infiltrating water.

For a fixed suite of strength and transport parameters, and for measured magma influx rates, the {{evolution of}} instability may be followed. The evolving factor of safety tracks the observed March 2000 and July 2001 rainfall-concurrent collapse events, which evolve over months. However, the resolution of the hindcast is unable to discriminate between the effects of closely-timed rainfall events (order of hours). The heightening of the dome is shown to exert the principal influence on average slopes and in the evolution of instability.

However, some historic scoria cones have been observed to form with phases of more energetic violent Strombolian eruptions (e. g., the 1943 – 1952 eruption of Parícutin, central Mexico; the 1975 eruption of Tolbachik, Kamchatka), maintaining volcanic plumes several kilometers in height, sometimes simultaneous with active <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows.</b> Geologic evidence shows that violent Strombolian eruptions during cone formation may be more common than is generally perceived, and therefore {{it is important to}} obtain additional insights about such eruptions to better assess volcanic hazards. We studied Irao Volcano, the largest basaltic monogenetic volcano in the Abu Monogenetic Volcano Group, SW Japan.

The characteristics of the volcanic products suggest that the rate of magma ascent decreased gradually throughout the eruption and that less explosive Strombolian eruptions increased in frequency during the later stages of activity.

40|$|During {{explosive}} eruptions, volcanic plumes inject ash {{into the}} atmosphere and may severely affect air traffic, {{as illustrated by the}} 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption. Quantitative estimates of ash injection can be deduced from the height reached by the volcanic plume on the basis of scaling laws inferred from models of powerful Plinian plumes. In less explosive basaltic eruptions, there is a partitioning of the magma influx between the atmospheric plume and an <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flow</b> on the ground. We link the height reached by the volcanic plume with the rate of ash injection in the atmosphere via a refined plume model that (1) includes a recently developed variable entrainment law and (2) accounts for mass partitioning between ground flow and plume. We compute the time evolution of the rate of injection of ash {{into the atmosphere}} for the Eyjafjallajökull eruption on the basis of satellite thermal images and plume heights and use the dispersion model of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center of Toulouse to translate these numbers into hazard maps. The classical Plinian model would have overestimated ash injection by about 20 % relative to the refined estimate, which does not jeopardize risk assessment. This small error was linked to effective fragmentation by intense interactions of magma with water derived from melting of ice and hence strong mass partitioning into the plume. For a less well fragmented basaltic dry eruption, the error may reach 1 order of magnitude and hence undermine the prediction of ash dispersion, which demonstrates the need to monitor both plume heights and ground flows during an explosive eruption...|$|R

Several {{of the bodies}} are truncated by the Idaho or Utah border, and extend into the states for an unknown distance. This study focuses on five bodies, the Mahoganies, two near Wild Horse Reservoir, the outcrop enclosing the Jarbidge Mountains, and one outcrop south of Wells. The study’s focus is providing field, petrography, geochemistry, oxygen isotope, and geochronology information about the five previously mentioned bodies. Physical volcanology encountered during this study indicates the sampled Jarbidge Rhyolite are <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows</b> and domes that coalesced {{over the life of}} the volcanic system. First order approximations indicate that erupted products cover ~ 1, 289 km 2 and erupted material totals ~ 509 km 3. Petrography indicates primary anhydrous mineral assemblages, assimilation of granitoid, possible assimilation of metamorphic rock and magma mixing of mafic and silicic bodies. Collectively, the Jarbidge Rhyolite lava flows sampled are compositionally restricted from rhyolite to high silica rhyolite and all samples demonstrate A-type magma characteristics. Compositions from different bodies overlap on Harker diagrams, and trace element ratios distinguish few flows from the other samples. Rare earth element patterns mimic one another, and incompatible trace element ratios overlap between bodies, likely indicating the presence of one large magma body.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades low-field {{magnetic}} susceptibility measurements have become an increasingly attractive method for geological studies which use the scalar values (bulk susceptibility) {{as well as the}} directional information, the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS). Because of the potential for detecting weak fabric anisotropies, AMS has become a routine method for assessing flow directions in magmatic bodies. Sources of AMS in ferrimagnetic basaltic rocks are mainly titanomagnetites. After Jackson et al. (1998) and de Wall (2000), the magnetic susceptibility (MS) of titanomagnetite varies strongly with mineral composition and is in the low-field range strongly depending on the field amplitude of the inducing magnetic field. Here we present a systematic study to record the effects of field dependence on AMS of dykes, sills and lava flows. Variation in MS characteristics have been found indicative for lava emplacement and flow dynamics (Cañón-Tapia et al. 1997, Cañón-Tapia & Pinkerton 2000). The contribution of the effect of field dependence on MS and AMS in titanomagnetite-bearing volcanic rocks needs to be assessed for a reliable interpretation of AMS variations. The key study has been carried out at the Ság-hegy volcanic complex in the Little Hungarian Plain. It is composed of a phreatomagmatic tuff ring, formed during the pliocene-miocene period. After meteoric water supply ended, the phreatomagmatic eruptive style changed into an effusive behaviour and the tephra ring was filled with a lava lake and a dyke-sill complex transected the pyroclastic successions. We report AMS characteristics of sills, dykes and lavas from the lake interior and outflowing lava deposits. Furthermore we discriminated samples that represent the transition from dykes to sills and from intrusive (dyke) to <b>effusive</b> (lava <b>flow)</b> emplacement, respectively.

40|$|The {{eruption}} of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano started on 20 March 2010. The {{first phase of}} the eruption was <b>effusive,</b> producing lava <b>flows</b> on the glacier-free part of the volcano, with insignificant volcanic ash fallout. In the early morning of 14 April 2010, the eruption entered an explosive phase, ejecting volcanic ash to heights in excess of 9 km (Fig. 1) and causing major disruption to European air travel. The explosive phase of the eruption took place within the summit caldera under a 200 – 300 m thick ice cover. The meltwater and steam at the glacier-covered erup-tion site chilled the magma, causing it to disintegrate explosively and producing fine-grained volcanic ash particles that were able to travel long distances. Jökulhlaup, floods of meltwater, reached the lowlands around the volcano at about noon on 14 April. The ash-loaded erup-tion plume was deflected to the east by westerly winds, and ash started to fall in southeastern Iceland on 14 April. The next day, the eruption plume reached mainland Europe (Fig. 2). Most of the erupted material was in the form of volcanic ash. The ash was sent into the southeast-erly moving jet stream, which then carried the ash over Europe, into one of the busiest airspaces in the world...|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{volcanism}} {{is commonly}} {{related to a}} process known as fragmentation of magma containing bubbles rich in gas phases. This process is activated by the brittle failure of the melt as its strength is overcame by viscous stresses related to bubble growth and ascending magma flow. Individual volcanoes often produce alternating effusive and explosive eruptions which cyclical dynamics remain unclear and are a subject of ongoing debate. The Somma-Vesuvius, famous for its explosive Pompeii eruption in AD 79, generated a wide variety of eruptive events during the past 33 Ky, ranging from mild effusive (inter-Plinian) eruptions to highly disruptive (Plinian) phenomena. Over the last 3 decades, a large number of samples have been collected from the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. As a result of this research effort, a large database of chemical analyses of various volcanic products from lavas to pumices and tephra is currently available. This allowed for detailed studies of magma compositions aimed at reconstructing magma differentiation processes and identifying parental and primary magma compositions. Currently there is no general consensus on whether the primary magma precursors to both eruption styles were of a similar composition. At the same time, the compositions of mineral phases in Somma-Vesuvius volcanic products have received significantly less attention. Phenocrysts phases such as olivine and clinopyroxene occur early on the liquid line of descent and dominate fractional crystallization in the primitive magmas. At the later stages of crystallisation they are joined and/or replaced by feldspars, feldspathoids, biotite and oxides. This project aims at characterising minor and trace elements in both olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts from representative lava, scoriae and pumice samples from the main Plinian eruptions and a range of inter-Plinian events over the last 33 Ky. The main aim of this work is to present new constraints on the factors leading to the different Somma-Vesuvius eruptive styles. In order to achieve this goal, 14 pumice samples from Plinian pyroclastic deposits as well as 3 scoriae and 8 lava samples from <b>effusive</b> <b>flows</b> were collected, and a representative number of olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts were selected under an optical microscope from each sample and analysed with an electronic microprobe and by a LA-ICP mass-spectrometry, resulting in a large database containing 2127 EMP and 1259 LA-ICP-MS analyses. The mineral compositions obtained were examined considering the following two factors: 1) eruptive style; and 2) age of the samples. Magmas from Plinian and inter-Plinian eruptions were compared using {{the results of this study}} in conjunction with published data on lava chemistry and the compositions of melt and fluid inclusions in phenocrysts. Further, the mineral compositions have been compared with those from other volcanoes of the Roman Comagmatic Province (RCP) and also from other tectonic settings such as Oceanic Islands, Volcanic Rifts, Mid-ocean Ridges and Supra-subduction Zones, in order to assess the extent of compositional variation among Somma-Vesuvius olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts. The above approach led to the following main conclusions: I) olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallized simultaneously over a large temperature range from the earliest stages of melt evolution; II) both olivines and clinopyroxenes display clear bimodal distribution in terms of the proportions between the Mg-rich and Fe-rich end members (Mg# = Mg/(Mg+Fe)) : the primitive group has compositions Mg# 92 - 82, whereas the evolved group has compositions Mg# 82 - 72; III) both Plinian and inter-Plinian clinopyroxenes and olivines populations exhibit a narrow trend of major, minor and trace elements contents as a function of their Mg#, when compared with mineral compositions from other tectonic settings, including the RCP, indicating a narrow range of melt compositions within the Somma-Vesuvius plumbing system for a given stage of differentiation regardless of the eruption style; IV) clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts compositions in inter-Plinian eruption products display a narrower range compared to the Plinian eruptions; V) as the result of a narrow compositional range of phenocrysts in inter-Plinian eruptions, there is a larger difference in phenocryst populations composition between individual inter-Plinian eruptions than between Plinian eruptions; VI) The more evolved (Mg# 82 - 72) Plinian and inter-Plinian clinopyroxene phenocrysts in rocks younger than 2. 8 Ky show clear Ca enrichment (23. 5 - 24. 5 wt...|$|R
40|$|Stromboli {{is known}} for its mild, {{persistent}} explosive activity from the vents located within the summit crater depression at the uppermost part of the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) depression. <b>Effusive</b> activity (lava <b>flows)</b> at this volcano normally occurs every 5 – 15 years, involving often the opening of eruptive fissures along the SdF, and more rarely overflows from the summit crater.

An open question is why this activity has become so frequent during the last 6 years and was quite rare before. In this paper, we describe this exceptional activity and propose an interpretation based on the structural state of the volcano, changed after the 2002 – 2003 and even more after the 2007 flank effusive eruption. We use images from the Stromboli fixed cameras network, as well as ground photos, plume SO 2 and CO 2 fluxes released by the summit crater, and continuous fumarole temperature recording, to unravel the interplay between magma supply, structural and morphology changes, and lava flow output.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Centre for Volcanic Studies, University of Luton, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 'Natural' disasters have traditionally been viewed {{as the result of}} an extreme physical environment. A radical backlash against this dominant view, in the nineteen seventies and eighties, moved the debate to the opposite extreme and in doing so replaced physical with social determinism. Vulnerability analysis is proposed as a methodology that bridges these extremes. It takes into account individual decision making, social milieu and physical hazard when describing human habitation in areas of volcanic activity. It is argued that vulnerability should be defined in terms of universal human needs in order to avoid it simply being a measure of the chance of death and injury or losing its meaning in the uncertainty of cultural relativism. Once vulnerability is identified it is important to explore why it has come to exist. A contextual theory of vulnerability change is presented. Vulnerability to volcanic activity was explored in the area around Mt. Etna in Sicily (Italy) and Furnas volcano San Miguel in the Azores (Portugal) using a case study methodology. This included: collecting data through interviews (semistructured and structured) and field surveying, utilising census and other secondary data sources, and examining historical documents and texts. The volcanic hazard on Mt. Etna is related to regular (4 - 7 years) <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows</b> which threaten property and land rather than people. Living in a European state, it is likely that a victim of Mt. Etna will have their basic needs provided for in the long-term and therefore they are not vulnerable. In contrast the irregular explosive eruptions of Furnas, last eruption 1630, not only damage property and land but also endanger lives. The limited ability of individuals to protect themselves {{in the event of an}} eruption and organisations to aid them in this means that, in spite of state insurance, many around Furnas are vulnerable. The production of vulnerability around Etna and Furnas is strongly related to the socio-economic nature of the region and wider European and global contexts. Opportunities and constraints that exist across socio-physical space encourage behaviour and forms of life which, in tum, produce various levels of vulnerability. Individuals seem to cognitively diminish their perceptions of this threat within a context of social representations of low risk. They, and society as a whole, rarely seem to engage directly with the risk itself...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} compositions of martian basalts are {{enriched in}} iron {{with respect to}} terrestrial basalts. Their rheology is poorly known and liquids of this chemical composition have not been experimentally investigated. Here, we determine the viscosity of five synthetic silicate liquids having compositions representative {{of the diversity of}} martian volcanic rocks including primary martian mantle melts and alkali basalts. The concentric cylinder method has been employed between 1500 °C and the respective liquidus temperatures of these liquids. The viscosity near the glass transition has been derived from calorimetric measurements of the glass transition. Although some glass heterogeneity limits the accuracy of the data near the glass transition, it was nevertheless possible to determine the parameters of the non-Arrhenian temperature-dependence of viscosity over a wide temperature range (1500 °C to the glass transition temperature). At superliquidus conditions, the martian basalt viscosities are as low as those of the Fe–Ti-rich lunar basalts, similar to the lowest viscosities recorded for terrestrial ferrobasalts, and 0. 5 to 1 order of magnitude lower than terrestrial tholeiitic basalts. Comparison with empirical models reveals that Giordano et al. (2008) offers the best approximation, whereas the model proposed by Hui and Zhang (2007) is inappropriate for the compositions considered. The slightly lower viscosities exhibited by the melts produced by low degree of mantle partial melting versus melts produced at high degree of mantle partial melting (likely corresponding to the early history of Mars), is not deemed sufficient to lead to viscosity variations large enough to produce an overall shift of martian lava flow morphologies over time. Rather, the details of the crystallization sequence (and in particular the ability of some of these magmas to form spinifex texture) is proposed to be a dominant effect on the viscosity during martian lava flow emplacement and may explain the lower range of viscosities (102 – 104 Pas) inferred from lava flow morphology. Further, the differences between the rheological behaviors of tholeiitic vs. trachy-basalts are significant enough to affect their emplacement as intrusive bodies or as <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows.</b> The upper range of viscosities (106 – 108 Pas) suggested from lava flow morphology is found consistent with the occurrence of alkali basalt documented from in situ analyses and does not necessarily imply the occurrence of basaltic-andesite or andesitic rocks...|$|R

The ridge segment north of the Orozco transform fault (15 ° 22 ′- 16 ° 20 ′N) is the shallowest and broadest along more than 5000 km of the East Pacific Rise, whereas the adjacent segment to the north (16 ° 16 ′- 18 °N) has a "typical" morphology for its intermediate spreading rate. Both ridge segments were densely sampled during the PANR 01 MV cruise and 36 samples of axial lava flows, consisting mainly of glasses from the rims of the flows and some fragments of lobate basalts, were selected from this collection for paleointensity experiments. The Coe version of the Thellier double-heating procedure (in air) was used. Twenty-seven units provide internally consistent paleointensity estimates leading to precise estimates of the paleofield, which range between 8 μT and 57 μT. Comparisons with reference paleointensity curves compiled from subaerial flows, archeomagnetic data and sedimentary records projected to the sampling site coordinates show that the measured values can be used to constrain the volcanic history of the ridge segments over the past few thousand years. A good agreement was found between apparent "freshness" of the glasses, the geochemistry of the lavas, and their magnetic paleointensity values. The inflated southern segment seems characterized by recent activities as indicated by numerous flows with paleointensities clustering around today's value (39 μT) or around the high values typical of 2000 - 3000 years ago (~ 55 μT). We interpret this distribution to indicate the flooding by <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows</b> of the entire axial plateau some 2000 - 3000 years ago, followed by a volcanic phase producing smaller volume lava flows confined to the innermost 200 m of the ridge axis. The northern ridge segment is characterized by dispersed paleointensity values consistent with a series of small eruptions of diverse ages. Samples collected at the tips of both ridge segments across the 16 ° 20 ′N axial discontinuity have the lowest paleointensities and are thus thought to be significantly older, consistent with models advocating reduced magmatism near ridge axis discontinuities. This study demonstrates the strong potential of paleointensity measurements as a tool to help constrain volcanic history at ridge axes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Explosive {{volcanism}} {{is commonly}} {{related to a}} process known as fragmentation of magma containing bubbles rich in gas phases. This process is activated by the brittle failure of the melt as its strength is overcame by viscous stresses related to bubble growth and ascending magma flow. Individual volcanoes often produce alternating effusive and explosive eruptions which cyclical dynamics remain unclear and are a subject of ongoing debate. The Somma-Vesuvius, famous for its explosive Pompeii eruption in AD 79, generated a wide variety of eruptive events during the past 33 Ky, ranging from mild effusive (inter-Plinian) eruptions to highly disruptive (Plinian) phenomena. Over the last 3 decades, a large number of samples have been collected from the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. As a result of this research effort, a large database of chemical analyses of various volcanic products from lavas to pumices and tephra is currently available. This allowed for detailed studies of magma compositions aimed at reconstructing magma differentiation processes and identifying parental and primary magma compositions. Currently there is no general consensus on whether the primary magma precursors to both eruption styles were of a similar composition. At the same time, the compositions of mineral phases in Somma-Vesuvius volcanic products have received significantly less attention. Phenocrysts phases such as olivine and clinopyroxene occur early on the liquid line of descent and dominate fractional crystallization in the primitive magmas. At the later stages of crystallisation they are joined and/or replaced by feldspars, feldspathoids, biotite and oxides. This project aims at characterising minor and trace elements in both olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts from representative lava, scoriae and pumice samples from the main Plinian eruptions and a range of inter-Plinian events over the last 33 Ky. The main aim of this work is to present new constraints on the factors leading to the different Somma-Vesuvius eruptive styles. In order to achieve this goal, 14 pumice samples from Plinian pyroclastic deposits as well as 3 scoriae and 8 lava samples from <b>effusive</b> <b>flows</b> were collected, and a representative number of olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts were selected under an optical microscope from each sample and analysed with an electronic microprobe and by a LA-ICP mass-spectrometry, resulting in a large database containing 2127 EMP and 1259 LA-ICP-MS analyses. The mineral compositions obtained were examined considering the following two factors: 1) eruptive style; and 2) age of the samples. Magmas from Plinian and inter-Plinian eruptions were compared using {{the results of this study}} in conjunction with published data on lava chemistry and the compositions of melt and fluid inclusions in phenocrysts. Further, the mineral compositions have been compared with those from other volcanoes of the Roman Comagmatic Province (RCP) and also from other tectonic settings such as Oceanic Islands, Volcanic Rifts, Mid-ocean Ridges and Supra-subduction Zones, in order to assess the extent of compositional variation among Somma-Vesuvius olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts. The above approach led to the following main conclusions: I) olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallized simultaneously over a large temperature range from the earliest stages of melt evolution; II) both olivines and clinopyroxenes display clear bimodal distribution in terms of the proportions between the Mg-rich and Fe-rich end members (Mg# = Mg/(Mg+Fe)) : the primitive group has compositions Mg# 92 - 82, whereas the evolved group has compositions Mg# 82 - 72; III) both Plinian and inter-Plinian clinopyroxenes and olivines populations exhibit a narrow trend of major, minor and trace elements contents as a function of their Mg#, when compared with mineral compositions from other tectonic settings, including the RCP, indicating a narrow range of melt compositions within the Somma-Vesuvius plumbing system for a given stage of differentiation regardless of the eruption style; IV) clinopyroxene and olivine phenocrysts compositions in inter-Plinian eruption products display a narrower range compared to the Plinian eruptions; V) as the result of a narrow compositional range of phenocrysts in inter-Plinian eruptions, there is a larger difference in phenocryst composition populations between individual inter-Plinian eruptions than between Plinian eruptions; VI) The more evolved (Mg# 82 - 72) Plinian and inter-Plinian clinopyroxene phenocrysts in rocks younger than 2. 8 Ka show clear Ca enrichment (23. 5 - 24. 5 wt % CaO) in respect to the older rocks. Some of the more primitive olivine phenocrysts (Fo# 92 - 82) from the inter-Plinian eruptions younger than AD 472 (CaO 0. 30 - 0. 45 wt %) are also more enriched in Ca than older olivine phenocrysts; VII) Overall, the compositions of clinopyroxenes from the inter-Plinian eruptions display REE contents which are within the range of the Plinian clinopyroxenes. The above results suggest: I) a prevalently magmatic origin of olivine phenocrysts whose presence was previously mainly ascribed to magma reaction with the carbonate basement of the Campania Plain; II) Persisting multiple sites of crystallisation where magmas of variable extent of fractionation reside at any given time regardless of the type of eruptive activity; III) Chemically similar sources of parental magmas feeding the Somma-Vesuvius system, which does not appear to have changed over the last 33 Ky; and IV) A common composition of parental magmas for the Plinian and inter-Plinian eruptions of the Somma-Vesuvius. Therefore, this study suggests that the magma residence times and the magma supply rate are the likely main factors controlling eruption style at Somma-Vesuvius. Further insights into these processes may be derived from the study of melt and fluid inclusions within the Somma-Vesuvius olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, which is envisaged as a continuation to this project...|$|R
40|$|On October 17, 1891 a {{submarine}} eruption occurred at Foerstner volcano in the Straits of Sicily 4 km {{northwest of the}} island of Pantelleria, Italy. The eruption produced floating scoria bombs, or balloons, that discharged gas at the surface and eventually sank to the seafloor. Activity occurred {{for a period of}} one week from an eruptive vent located within the Pantelleria Rift at a water depth of 250 m. ^ Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video footage and high resolution multibeam mapping of the Foerstner vent site was used to create a geologic map of the 1891 AD deposits and conduct the first detailed study of the source area associated with this unusual type of submarine volcanism. The main Foerstner vent consists of two overlapping circular mounds with a total volume of 6. 3 x 10 5 m 3 and relief of 60 m. It is dominantly constructed of clastic scoriaceous deposits with some interbedded <b>effusive</b> pillow <b>flow</b> deposits. Petrographic and geochemical analyses of Foerstner samples by X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry reveal {{that the majority of the}} deposits are highly to extremely vesicular, hypocrystalline tephrite basanite scoria that display porphyritic, hyaloophitic, and vitrophyric textures. An intact scoria balloon recovered from the seafloor consists of an interior gas cavity surrounded by a thin lava shell comprised of two distinct layers; a thin, oxidized quenched crust surrounding the exterior of the balloon and a dark grey, tachylite layer lying beneath it. Ostwald ripening is determined to be the dominant bubble growth mechanism of four representative Foerstner scoria samples as determined by vesicle size distributions. ^ Characterization of the diversity of deposit facies observed at Foerstner in conjunction with quantitative rock texture analysis indicates that Strombolian-like activity is the most likely mechanism for the formation of buoyant scoria bombs. The deposit facies observed at the main Foerstner vent are very similar to those produced by other known submarine Strombolian eruptions (short pillow flow lobes, large scoriaceous clasts, spatter-like vent facies). Balloons were likely formed from the rapid cooling of extremely vesicular magma fragments as a result of a gas-rich frothy magma source. The exterior of these fragments hyperquenched forming a vesicular glassy shell that acted as an insulating layer preventing magmatic gas in its interior from escaping and thus allowing flotation as densities reached less than 1000 kg/m 3. We believe that lava balloon eruptions are more common than previously thought, as the eruptive conditions required to generate these products are likely to be present in a variety of submarine volcanic environments. Additionally, the facies relationships observed at Foerstner may be used as a paleoenvironmental indicator for modern and ancient basaltic shallow submarine eruptions because of the relatively narrow depth range over which they likely occur (200 - 400 m). ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Volcan Aucanquilcha, a Pleistocene to Recent {{composite}} volcano {{in northern}} Chile, {{is the youngest}} and center-most member of the 11 m. y. -old Aucanquilcha Volcanic Cluster (AVC). The AVC has produced [approximately] 350 km³ of lava over its history. Magmatism started slowly and was punctuated by high rates of eruption between 4. 5 and 2. 5 Ma. The AVC records a history of progressive fractionation and homogenization as the upper crustal becomes thermally and compositionally buffer through repeated intrusion. The pattern of volcanism at the AVC, from diffuse to central, mimics that seen in exposed intrusive bodies. The AVC is likely the volcanic record of the incremental emplacement of an intermediate batholith over a span of at least 11 million years. Volcan Aucanquilcha has produced [approximately] 37 km³ of compositionally and mineralogically monotonous dacite over the past 1 million years. The volcano has erupted dominantly <b>effusive</b> dacite lava <b>flows</b> with one debris avalanche deposit and one dome collapse pyroclastic flow. It also contains a ubiquitous bimodal amphibole population of hornblende and pargasite phenocrysts. P-T data from amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides indicate a multilevel geometry for the magmatic system within the top 10 -km of the upper crust. The generation of magma at Aucanquilcha begins with intrusion of andesite that fractionates to mafic dacite. Magmas will then either mix with low [delta]¹⁸ 0 upper crustal and creating a high-K dacite or will continue to fractionate to silicic dacite. In both cases, two similar dacite magmas, stored at different P-T condition mix rapidly during eruption. The repeated intrusion of magma into the upper crust during {{the history of the}} AVC has allowed for thermal and compositional buffering of the crust, creating the conditions for Volcan Aucanquilcha to erupt monotonous dacite lava. The location of eruptive vents appears to be controlled by crustal lineaments that not only focus hydrothermal fluids but may allow for the eruption of the relatively degassed dacite. Otherwise, the lavas of Aucanquilcha may have stalled underground to form a porphyry-style stock...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the full}} nature and {{dynamics}} of the 1944 eruption is important {{not only because it}} was the last eruption at Vesuvius but also because recent research suggests that an eruption of a similar magnitude might be the most likely scenario for a future event at this volcano. The 1944 eruption happened immediately following the liberation of the region by the Allies toward the end of World War II, nevertheless there a number of contemporary accounts and extensive photographic documentation of this event. Until now there has, however, been no modern volcanological reconstruction of the 1944 event that attempts to fully integrate studies of the products of the eruption with the contemporary accounts. The products of this recent eruption are well exposed allowing correlation of distal tephra with ultra proximal deposits on the crater rim. The eruption began on the 18 th March and lasted five days. Initially the eruption was <b>effusive,</b> with lava <b>flows</b> overtopping the crater rim in several directions. The explosive phase began as a series of eight discrete lava fountains which took place over a 24 hr period on the 21 st March. The climax of the eruption took place on the 22 nd March accompanied by intense seismicity. The explosive phase dispersed lapilli fall out mainly to the southeast, distal ash was recorded as far as Albania (500 km from the source). Initial lapilli, associated with fountains, was mainly composed of vesicular scoria whereas the paroxysmal phase included significant quantities of dense juvenile material. Later phases of explosive activity were ash-rich and were dispersed to the southwest. A new reconstruction of the distribution of the products and of the physical parameters associated with the different phases of the eruption allows us to classify this event as ‘subplinian', although it has previously been described as being ‘violent strombolian'. Small pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) were generated during the eruption however origin of these is enigmatic and there are conflicting theories as to how these were formed. We first describe the exposed products of these PDCs and discuss their potential origins...|$|R
40|$|Vico Volcano {{in central}} Italy, {{experienced}} a complex eruptive history (419 – 95 ka). The Vico volcanic edifice was constructed by voluminous (50 km 3) leucitite composition <b>effusive</b> lava <b>flows</b> and minor explosive activity over a 50 ka period (305 – 258 ka). The {{summit of the}} edifice was destroyed during the Sutri eruption (151 ka) {{that resulted in the}} formation of the 8 km caldera depression. A revised stratigraphy for the eruptive products produced by the Sutri eruption (Sutri Formation) is proposed, based on extensive field observations, detailed stratigraphic logging and petrographic analysis; the Sutri A unit consists of a fallout deposit of limited dispersal; the Sutri B unit consists of a small volume, variably welded pumice-rich ignimbrite; the Sutri C unit is a lithic and spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the Sutri D unit is a fines-depleted pumice-rich ignimbrite; Sutri (E 1 –E 3) subunits consist of spatter clast-rich ignimbrite; Sutri E 4 (sbx) is a spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the Sutri E 4 (lsbx) subunit is a lithic, pumice and spatter clast-rich co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccia; the climactic Sutri E 5 unit is a variably zeolitised spatter and pumice-rich ignimbrite (with lithic-rich base; Sutri E 4 flsbx) to the west). The reconstruction of the Sutri eruption leading up to and including formation of the Vico Caldera based on the new stratigraphy of the Sutri Formation, consists of three distinct phases: Phase 1 —Initial Plinian activity produced a fallout deposit (Sutri A) deposited to the south, followed by partial eruption column collapse that generated a pyroclastic flow directed to the south/southeast (Sutri B). Vent widening in response to vent-wall rock instabilities and increased magma discharge rate overloaded the eruption column with dense, lithic debris resulting in southward collapse and deposition of a thick co-ignimbrite lag breccia in the deflation zone (Sutri C). A change in clast supply at vent from lithic clast-dominated to pumice clast-dominated produced a fines-depleted ignimbrite, Sutri D (plbx) prior to cessation of activity in the south. Phase 2 —Shortly following the initial Plinian phase or partially overlapping, decompression of the magma chamber in response to partial magma chamber roof block collapse promoted explosive fragmentation of magma at the base of the conduit (as pumice) and led to the opening of a new vent in the north. Sustained mixing of highly vesiculated, grey pumice clasts and dense, poorly vesiculated, black spatter clasts occurred both in the conduit and in the eruption column and subsequent column collapse produced a small volume pyroclastic flow directed to the north, dominated by dense, black spatter clasts (Sutri E 1 –E 3). Phase 3 —Sustained eruptive activity continued in the north and increased magma discharge rate likely then resulted in great instability of the magma chamber roof and surrounding wall rocks of the progressively draining magma chamber. The eruption column collapsed radially depositing vast quantities of lithic clasts, spatter clasts and some pumice clasts into the deflation zone as co-ignimbrite lag-flow breccias (Sutri E 4 sbx, lsbx), signalling the onset of caldera collapse. Eruption column collapse also produced a radially distributed, pyroclastic flow that deposited a moderate volume ignimbrite (Sutri E 5) with a lithic-rich base (Sutri E 4 flsbx) at proximal localities in the west. Final caldera collapse occurred shortly following emplacement of Sutri E 5 presumably in response to evacuation of the magma chamber and final collapse of the magma chamber roof. We infer from the eruption dynamics that progressive collapse of the magma chamber roof occurred culminating in final climactic and post-eruptive caldera collapse...|$|R
40|$|Two mid-Miocene (16. 5 - 15 Ma) {{rhyolite}} volcanic {{centers in}} eastern Oregon, the Buchanan rhyolite complex and Dooley Mountain rhyolite complex, were investigated to characterize eruptive units through field and laboratory analysis. Results of petrographic and geochemical analysis add to field observations to differentiate and discriminate the eruptive units. Additionally, new geochemical data {{are used to}} correlate stratigraphically younger and older basalt and ash-flow tuff units with regional eruptive units to constrain the eruptive periods with modern Ar-Ar age dates. Previous work at the Buchanan rhyolite complex was limited to regional mapping (Piper et al., 1939; Greene et al., 1972) and brief mention {{of the possibility of}} multiple eruptive units (Walker, 1979). Observed stratigraphic relationships and geochemical analysis were used to identify eight distinct eruptive units and create a geologic map of their distribution. Slight differences in trace element enrichment are seen in mantle normalized values of Ba, Sr, P, Ti and Nd-Zr-Hf and are used to differentiate eruptive units. New geochemical analyses are used to correlate the overlying Buchanan ash-flow tuff (Brown and McLean, 1980) and two underlying mafic units to the Wildcat Creek ash-flow tuff (~ 15. 9 Ma, Hooper et al., 2002) and flows of the Upper Steens Basalt (~ 16. 57 Ma, Brueseke et al., 2007), respectively, bracketing the eruptive age of the Buchanan rhyolite complex to between ~ 16. 5 and ~ 15. 9 Ma (Brueseke et al., 2007; Hooper et al., 2002). The Dooley Mountain rhyolite complex was thoroughly mapped by the U. S. Geological Survey (Evans, 1992) and geochemically differentiated in a previous Portland State University M. S. thesis (Whitson, 1988); however, discrepancies between published interpretations and field observations necessitated modern geochemical data and revisions to geologic interpretations. Field and laboratory studies indicate that the Dooley Mountain rhyolite complex consists of multiple eruptive units that were <b>effusive</b> domes and <b>flows</b> with associated explosive eruptions subordinate in volume. At least four geochemically distinct eruptive units are described with variations in Ba, Sr, Zr and Nb. Picture Gorge Basalt flows and Dinner Creek Tuff units found within the study area both overlay and underlie the Dooley Mountain rhyolite complex. These stratigraphic relationships are consistent with the one existing Ar-Ar age date 15. 59 ± 0. 04 Ma (Hess, 2014) for the Dooley rhyolite complex, bracketing the eruptive period between ~ 16. 0 and ~ 15. 2 Ma (Streck et al., 2015; Barry et al., 2013). The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the Buchanan rhyolite complex and the Dooley Mountain rhyolite complex are the westernmost and northernmost rhyolite complexes among the earliest (16 - 16. 5 Ma) mid-Miocene rhyolites associated with initiation of Yellowstone hot spot related volcanism...|$|R
