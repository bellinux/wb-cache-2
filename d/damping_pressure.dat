40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} the pressure loss characteristics of thin, single-blade flat dampers in square branch ducts in the turbulent region. The <b>damper</b> <b>pressure</b> loss characteristics and the interactions between the damper blade and shaft have been studied at various damper width ratios {{to take account of}} the damper leakage effects. At damper angles > 10 °, the <b>damper</b> <b>pressure</b> loss characteristics determined for damper -width ratios of 0. 5 to 1. 414 are found to be independent of the shaft sizes for typical rectangular and circular shafts with blockage area ratios ≤ 0. 16. The <b>damper</b> <b>pressure</b> loss coefficients are observed to have collapsed onto a single curve within a ± 10 % accuracy for damper width ratios of 0. 9 to 1. 414. By applying this relationship to square, flat airtight dampers in square branch ducts, the desired flow characteristics for branch ducts fitted with proportional damper controller-actuators can be achieved within a maximum deviation of ± 10 %. This helps solve the nonlinearity problem in the installed damper characteristics for large, complex, variable air volume systems having branch ducts with different resistances. Using a graphical approach, the required tuning parameter values for square, single-blade airtight dampers have also been determined for use by control system designers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{periodicity}} of {{compressor operation}} {{is a source}} of pressure pulsations in volumetric compressor manifolds. An analysis of pressure pulsations is important for several reasons. The Helmholtz model, applied in all commercial programs offered by the companies pro-fessionally dealing with <b>damping</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsations, contains numerous simplifying assumptions; a straight pipe segment, with an ideal gas isentropic flow assumption, substitutes each element of the piping system. In many cases this model is insufficient. The existing experimental methods could not be used in the design of a muffler. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show a new method to identify an arbitrary fragment of a manifold, i. e. a method of identification of the appropriate complex trans-mittance matrix elements using CFD simulation. This method allows the liquid phase dispersed in the compressed gas and non ideal gas as a working medium to also be considered. The most important conclusion of this work is that identification of acoustic element parameters in the manifold, based on multi-dimensional simulation model, is feasible. The author obtained much better results from the developed method than those yielded by the classic Helmholtz model.

At least 80 % of this blood flow is considered to perfuse the brain. At the same time mean blood velocity {{in the middle and}} anterior cerebral arteries was measured by Duplex Doppler scanning. While blood {{flow to the}} head and arms remained substantially constant in both groups over the first 48 hours of life (60 ml/ 100 g brain weight/min), blood velocity doubled in both cerebral arteries in the preterm group. The term infants had higher blood velocities in both arteries at all times, but the velocities also increased over 48 hours, although to a lesser extent than in the preterm group. These findings imply that the major intracranial arteries are themselves vasoactive, being dilated at birth and subsequently constricting, possibly as an autoregulatory response to rising arterial blood pressure. While vasodilated, the cerebral arteries will be less efficient at <b>damping</b> <b>pressure</b> transients, placing preterm infants at particular risk of periventricular haemorrhage during the early hours of life. The implications for possible approaches to the prevention of cerebral haemorrhage are discussed. Despite extensive investigation, the physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying both cer-ebral haemorrhage and ischaemia in the preterm newborn infant remain controversial. The common observation of a high incidence of periventricular haemorrhage during the first 48 to 72 hours of life ' 2 and the relative rarity thereafter, irrespective of the severity of later illness, has led to the hypothesis that susceptibility to haemorrhage and possibly cerebral ischaemia is related to the process of cardiovascular adaptation to extrauterine life. In this study we investigated the dynamics of the cerebral circulation in both full term and preterm infants during the first 48 hours of life.

40|$|If {{for high}} power {{applications}} the two-phase thermal loop has been highly investigated in the literature, thermal loops for power less than 1 kW has been scarcely studied. They could {{be divided into}} two main groups: high Bond number loops, where the capillary force can be neglected, and low Bond number loops, where the capillary forces cannot be neglected at all (Filippeschi & Franco, 2010). This paper deals with the effect of the geometry of the sections connecting the evaporator and the condenser, on the heat transfer rate in a low Bond number two-phase thermosyphon made of flexible pipes. A low Bond number loop two-phase thermosyphon is also referred in the literature as single turned Pulsating Heat Pipe. These loops are characterized by a natural circulation of mass flow inside. They consist of: an evaporator, a condenser and two adiabatic sections (the riser and the downcomer) which connect the two exchangers. In many applications like as PV solar cells cooling the condenser and the evaporator can be out of alignment, so that the use of the flexible pipes seems to be necessary. Several papers in the literature have experimentally shown that the heat transfer rate, which can be transferred from the evaporator to the condenser section, mainly depends on few parameters like as: the diameter of the tube, the working fluid, the adiabatic section length, the number of the turns and the operative orientation with respect to the gravity. However the thermal and hydraulic oscillations in these devices can not be accurately predicted and the heat and mass transfer phenomena is still unsolved problem. The use of flexible pipes for the adiabatic section introduce additional problems because the evaporator and the condenser sections cab be placed in any configuration, even out of alignment. In this configuration additional forces and additional pressure drops can decelerate or accelerate the motion. In addition the use of unconstraint pipes could develop <b>damping</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations with different frequencies. In particular in this paper the authors wish to understand the effect of the geometry of these sections on the slugs and plugs motion inside the loop, and in particular of the bends and of the extension of the horizontal section. The experimental facility consists of a single closed loop of capillary dimensions. In particular the evaporator section is copper plate where a long circular hole has been realised (Internal Diameter: 2. 0 mm, OD: 4. 0 mm). The condenser section is a pipe made of brass (ID: 2. 1 mm,OD: 3. 0 mm). It is designed to facilitate parametric investigations as well as simultaneous flow-visualization. The condenser and the evaporator are connected with flexible pipes made of PTFE (ID: 2. 0 mm,OD: 3. 0 mm). The evaporator section is heated by two flat electrical heaters. The condenser section, made of a hollow copper chamber, is supplied with cooling water from a constant temperature bath. Adequate thermal insulation is provided on all sections. The working fluid is water. The motion of the plugs and the slugs is observed with a high-speed acquisition video-camera. The unstable two-phase flow of a single turned PHP has been qualitatively described in (Khandekhar et al, 2009) (Di Marco & Filippeschi, (2010).

In this work, the VAPEX process is studied using a compositional simulator {{on a number of}} single-block and multiple block fractured systems. PVT data of one of an Iranian heavy oil reservoir are used to tune the equation of state. Effects of fracture spacing on the performance of process were studied. It was found that the fracture network enhances the VAPEX process in low-permeability systems by increasing the contact area between solvent and oil contained in the matrix blocks.

Resonant responses and quality factors are monitored in five different gases and one liquid, in pressures ranging from vacuum to 20 MPa, in order to evaluate theoretical models of device-fluid interactions at the nanoscale. The traditional Newell picture of microresonator <b>damping</b> in different <b>pressure</b> regimes {{is found to be}} inadequate in describing nanoresonators in general. <b>Damping</b> at intermediate <b>pressure</b> ranges is better physically characterized by a Weissenberg number (which compares oscillation frequencies with fluid relaxation rates) than a Knudsen number (which compares mean free paths with device widths) and most adequately described by the Yakhot and Colosqui model. At high-pressure ranges, two models are found to give good agreement with data: the phenomenological model of vibrating spheres and the Sader and Bhiladvala model for the viscous regime. The latter is also successful in explicitly predicting pressure-dependent behavior of the viscous mass load and damping. We observe significant increases in damping due to the squeezed film (SF) of gas between the device and substrate as well as due to undercut (an unavoidable artifact of the standard fabrication technique); correcting the shape of the devices with a focused ion beam allows us to differentiate these two factors. Application of the SF model accounts well for additional <b>damping</b> at high <b>pressures</b> while only qualitatively agreeing at lower pressures.

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{approach}} is presented for blade loss simulation of an aircraft gas turbine rotor mounted on rolling element bearings with squeeze film dampers, seal rub and enclosed in a flexible housing. The modal truncation augmentation (MTA) method provides an efficient tool for modeling this large order system with localized nonlinearities in the ball bearings. The gas turbine engine, which is composed of the power turbine and gas generator rotors, is modeled with 38 lumped masses. A nonlinear angular contact bearing model is employed, which has ball and race degrees of freedom and uses a modified Hertzian contact force between the races and balls and for the seal rub. This combines a dry contact force and viscous damping force. A flexible housing with seal rub is also included whose modal description is imported from ANSYS. Prediction of the maximum contact load and the corresponding stress on an elliptical contact area between the races and balls is made during the blade loss simulations. A finite-element based squeeze film damper (SFD), which determines the pressure profile of the oil film and calculates damper forces for any type of whirl orbit is utilized in the simulation.

40|$|Drilling {{operations}} are preformed by several countries. Some countries {{are forced to}} drill offshore, whereas others to drill onshore. Offshore drilling {{operations are}} more challenging comparing to onshore operations. The sea waves disturbs the rig/drill ship continuously. Floaters such as drill ships and floating rigs are more affected by the waves than fixed construction. The result of the sea waves are horizontal and vertical movements of the floaters. However, the horizontal movements are eliminated with advanced positioning systems. Whilst the vertical movements are avoided with use of heave-compensators. Extension of the drill string is needed during drilling operations. The extension stage is called &# 147;connections&# 148;. During connections, the mud pump and the heave-compensators are disabled. Which causes the floaters to oscillate vertically due to the sea waves. Such vertical movements of the floaters causes the drill string to move vertically inside the well. Vertical movements of the drill string are unwanted, as they create pressure changes in the wellbore. Pressure alterations may cause huge damages to the well and the drill string.

Pressure oscillations triggered by the nozzle closure after each injection event induce disturbances in the amount of fuel injected during subsequent injections. This causes a remarkable dispersion m the mass of fuel injected when DT is varied. The effects of the hydraulic circuit layout of CR systems were investigated with the objective to provide design rules for reducing the dependence of the injected fuel amount on DT. A multijet CR of the latest solenoid-type generation was experimentally analyzed at different operating conditions on a high performance test bench The considerable influence that the injector-supplying pipe dimensions can exert on the frequency and amplitude of the injection-induced pressure oscillations was widely investigated and a physical explanation of cause-effect relationships was found by energetics considerations, starting from experimental tests. A parametric study was performed to identify the best geometrical configurations of the injector-supplying pipe so as to minimize pressure oscillations. The analysis was carried out with the aid of a previously developed simple zero-dimensional model, allowing the evaluation of pressure-wave frequencies as functions of main system geometric data. Pipes of innovative aspect ratio and capable of halving the amplitude of injected-volume fluctuations versus DI were proposed.

40|$|A fast {{tracking}} {{technique for}} doing beam tail simulations {{has been applied}} to a study of beam-beam effects in the SLAC/LBL/LLNL PEP-II B Factory. In particular, the dependence of beam lifetime and particle density distribution due to vacuum <b>pressure,</b> <b>damping</b> times, machine nonlinearity and parasitic crossings has been analyzed. Effects of accidental orbit separation and dispersion function at the interaction point (IP) have also been considered...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} has been performed for oscillatory burning of solid propellants including gas phase time lag. The gaseous flame {{is assumed to}} be premixed and laminar with a one-step overall chemical reaction. The propellant is assumed to decompose according to the Arrenhius Law, with no condensed phase reaction. With this model, strong gas phase resonance has been found in certain cases at the characteristic gas-phase frequencies, but the peaking of the acoustic admittance is in the direction favoring the <b>damping</b> of <b>pressure</b> waves. At still higher frequencies, moderate wave-amplifying ability was found. The limit of low frequency response obtained previously by Denison and Baum was recovered, and the limitations of the quasi-steady theory were investigated...|$|R
