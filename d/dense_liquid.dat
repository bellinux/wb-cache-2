The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled out. There {{is evidence that the}} icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very <b>dense</b> <b>liquid</b> water or water–ammonia. Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water. Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so one half of the planet will be a magma ocean. It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts. Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface. Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.|$|E

2500|$|Figures 1 and 2 show {{projections}} of a phase diagram. In the pressure-temperature phase diagram (Fig. 1) the boiling separates {{the gas and}} liquid region and ends in the critical point, where the liquid and gas phases disappear to become a single supercritical phase. This {{can be observed in}} the density-pressure phase diagram for carbon dioxide, as shown in Figure 2. At well below the critical temperature, e.g., 280K, as the pressure increases, the gas compresses and eventually (at just over 40 bar) condenses into a much denser liquid, resulting in the discontinuity in the line (vertical dotted line). The system consists of 2 phases in equilibrium, a <b>dense</b> <b>liquid</b> and a low density gas. As the critical temperature is approached (300K), the density of the gas at equilibrium becomes higher, and that of the liquid lower. [...] At the critical point, (304.1 K and 7.38 MPa (73.8 bar)), there is no difference in density, and the 2 phases become one fluid phase. Thus, above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure. At slightly above the critical temperature (310K), {{in the vicinity of the}} critical pressure, the line is almost vertical. A small increase in pressure causes a large increase in the density of the supercritical phase. [...] Many other physical properties also show large gradients with pressure near the critical point, e.g. viscosity, the relative permittivity and the solvent strength, which are all closely related to the density. At higher temperatures, the fluid starts to behave like a gas, as can be seen in Figure 2. For carbon dioxide at 400 K, the density increases almost linearly with pressure.|$|E

40|$|We perform {{extensive}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of <b>dense</b> <b>liquids</b> composed of bidisperse dimer- and ellipse-shaped particles in 2 D that interact via repulsive contact forces. We measure the structural relaxation times {{obtained from the}} long-time decay of the self-part of the intermediate scattering function for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOF) {{as a function of}} packing fraction ϕ, temperature T, and aspect ratio α. We are able to collapse the ϕ and T-dependent structural relaxation times for disks, and dimers and ellipses over a wide range of α, onto a universal scaling function F_±(|ϕ-ϕ_ 0 |,T,α), which is similar to that employed in previous studies of <b>dense</b> <b>liquids</b> composed of purely repulsive spherical particles in 3 D. F_± for both the translational and rotational DOF are characterized by the α-dependent scaling exponents μ and δ and packing fraction ϕ_ 0 (α) that signals the crossover in the scaling form F_± from hard-particle dynamics to super-Arrhenius behavior for each aspect ratio. We find that the fragility at ϕ_ 0, m(ϕ_ 0), decreases monotonically with increasing aspect ratio for both ellipses and dimers. Moreover, the results for the slow dynamics of <b>dense</b> <b>liquids</b> composed of dimer- and ellipse-shaped particles are qualitatively the same, despite the fact that zero-temperature static packings of dimers are isostatic, while static packings of ellipses are hypostatic.
