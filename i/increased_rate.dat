5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
30|$|Temperature <b>increasing</b> <b>rate</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in growth {{mechanism}} of CNTs, and proper experimentation was conducted to see its influence on the diameter, yield and structural quality of grown CNTs. Successful observations were made in these fronts simply by tuning the temperature <b>increasing</b> <b>rate.</b> At lesser temperature <b>increasing</b> <b>rate,</b> MWNTs are synthesized, whereas at higher temperature <b>increasing</b> <b>rate,</b> SWNTs are successfully achieved. We also conclude that for the growth of best quality CNTs with lesser diameter, the temperature <b>increasing</b> <b>rate</b> should be as much as possible. It was proved by the present study that the size of the catalyst does not play any role in deciding the diameter of CNTs. In support of this observation, experimental results demonstrate that diameter of CNT is much lesser than the diameter of the catalyst. The disorders present on the top surface of catalyst particles are actually responsible and the decisive factor for the diameter of grown CNTs.|$|R

A drying rate - moisture content relationship for this period was obtained based on theoretical analysis. It was verified with experimental data. A quantitative representation of the complete drying rate curve was established using this relationship and a modified power law equation for the falling rate period drying rate - moisture content relation. It needs five parameters to quantify the through drying from wet to dry: moisture content {{at the end of the}} <b>increasing</b> <b>rate</b> period; exponent for the drying rate - moisture relationship during the <b>increasing</b> <b>rate</b> period; constant drying rate; critical moisture content and the power-law exponent for the falling rate period...|$|R
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to public opposition. In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E

The {{results showed that the}} TMP <b>increase</b> <b>rates</b> in the short-time constant flux filtration of alginate solutions were significantly affected by the calcium addition, alginate concentration, and flux.

5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E

At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been huddled in and around the cabins, but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E

5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors.

5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, <b>increased</b> <b>rate</b> and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
