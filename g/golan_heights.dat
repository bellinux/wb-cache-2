5|$|Quneitra is {{the capital}} of the Quneitra Governorate, a {{district}} of southwestern Syria that incorporates the whole of the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> The city of Quneitra is within the portion of the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> controlled by Syria. Madinat al-Baath (Baath City), also known as New Quneitra, replaced Quneitra as the administrative centre of Quneitra Governorate.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Menem {{became the}} first head of state of Argentina to make a {{diplomatic}} visit to Israel. He proposed to mediate between Israel and Syria in their negotiations over the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> The diplomatic relations were damaged {{by the lack of}} results in the investigations over the two terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December trouble {{came from}} another quarter, {{in the town}} of Safed, {{opposite}} the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> Fighting had started between the Arab and Jewish inhabitants. The police requested help from the army and a company from the 8th Parachute Battalion was assigned the task. Arabs fired at the British unit on 21December without causing any injuries.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|However, there {{remained}} {{too many}} signs for the Israelis to ignore, chief among {{which was the}} hasty Soviet evacuation from Cairo and Damascus, and the constant buildup of forces on the Syrian front when Egypt, it was assumed, would not enter war. Though the Chief of Staff, David Elazar, was assured that the probability of war remained low, he took precautionary steps on October 5. Elazar placed the entire military on alert, canceled all leaves, and ordered the Air Force to assume a full-alert posture. He also ordered the 7th Armored Brigade to relocate from the Sinai to the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> This raised Israeli numbers in the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> to 177 tanks and 44 artillery pieces on October 6. To replace the 7th Armored Brigade, the Armor School, {{under the command of}} Colonel Gabi Amir, was ordered to activate its tank brigade for immediate airlift; it was in the Sinai by October 6, before the war began. Ultimately though, no orders for mobilization were issued to reservists; Elazar and other senior commanders still expected a 24- to 48-hour warning from the intelligence services if the Arab nations were bent on war.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, its {{population}} {{was estimated at}} 153 persons, with some 4,000 more living in the surrounding areas of the former city. Quneitra now lies in the formerly demilitarized United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone (between Syrian territory and the Israeli-occupied <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights),</b> de facto controlled by the Syrian opposition, {{a short distance from}} the Quneitra border crossing, and is populated by only a handful of families.|$|E
5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra was the Syrian {{headquarters}} for the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.|$|E
5|$|Tension in the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> area {{remained}} {{high and}} on 9January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold {{were attacked by}} Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} saw the {{squadron}} participate in Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, {{which began with}} strikes against Egyptian air bases. Seven Phantoms led by squadron leader Yoram Agmon struck the air base at Gianaclis, and although two defending MiG-21s were shot down, the strike failed to cause significant damage. Tagar, moreover, was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> became apparent, and 69 Squadron efforts were redirected north where the IAF staged the ill-fated Operation Doogman 5. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost, including 69 Squadron's Ehud Hankin and Shaul Levy in Kurnass 123. Both were killed. The same evening saw appeals for help from the southern front, leading the squadron to fly strike missions against Egyptian bridges and assembly point on the Suez Canal. Another Phantom was lost to surface-to-air missiles, its crew falling into captivity. Four more aircraft were lost on the following day, October 8. One was lost in an otherwise successful morning strike against the Syrian air base at Dumayr, its crew captured. Another was lost over the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> and two more during night strikes against Egyptian bridges across the canal, all falling prey to the SA-6. Although four airmen were rescued by Israeli forces, pilot Zvulun Amizi and navigator Zeev Yogev were killed.|$|E
5|$|While {{their numbers}} remain uncertain, Syria {{received}} around 60 Panzers that were refurbished in France during 1950-1952, followed by 50 others purchased from Czechoslovakia in 1954. A Soviet DShK machine gun on an anti-aircraft mount was retrofitted on the cupola. These {{were used to}} shell Israeli settlements below the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> and were fired upon in 1965 during the Water War by Israeli Centurion tanks. Syria received 17 Panzer IVs from Spain; these saw combat during the Six-Day War in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{offensive}} in September 1918, the two divisions of Australian mounted troops, {{as well as}} the 1st Light Car Patrol and No. 1 Squadron AFC, took part in Battle of Megiddo on 28 September 1918, a decisive British victory in which 70,000 Turkish soldiers were taken prisoner. The Desert Mounted Corps attacked across the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> cutting off the north and north-west exits to Damascus on 29 September. On 30 September, the head of a column of 20,000 Turkish and German troops was annihilated by the Australian light horsemen as it attempted to withdraw west through the Barada Gorge. Australian troops were the first to enter Damascus, which fell on 1 October. Following an advance of , Aleppo was captured on 25 October. The Turkish government signed an armistice on 28 October 1918 and surrendered outright two days later.|$|E
5|$|Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron {{nevertheless}} {{entered the}} Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges {{brought about by}} start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this {{was rejected by the}} Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft {{were in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{intending to}} cross the Suez Canal and establish bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the Sinai Peninsula, which had been occupied by Israel since 1967. Coordinated with a Syrian assault on the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> the crossing achieved tactical surprise and was a success. Thereafter, counterattacks by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front {{had come to a}} lull. The Egyptians dug in and hoped to wear down the Israelis by attrition, while remaining within range of their ground surface-to-air missiles, which provided air cover from {{the west bank of the}} canal, while the Israelis focused on directing their main efforts against the Syrians in the Golan and reorganizing their battered forces. Israeli failures led to the replacement of the chief of the Israeli Southern Command, Major General Shmuel Gonen, with Chaim Bar-Lev, although Gonen was retained as his aide.|$|E
5|$|The Arab states {{surrounding}} the Mandate of Palestine started to prepare themselves {{a few weeks}} before May 15. According to the Arab plan, the Syrian army was to attack the new state from southern Lebanon and capture Safed. As such, the Syrians massed their forces in that area; however, after they found out that Lebanon did not wish to actively participate in combat, their plans changed to an attack from the southern <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> on Samakh (Tzemah) and later Tiberias. The Syrian force assembled in Qatana on May 1. It moved on May 12 to Beirut and to Sidon on May 13, after which it headed to Bint Jbeil. After the sudden plan change, the force moved to Nabatieh, and proceeded around the Finger of the Galilee to Banias and Quneitra, from which the eventual attack was staged.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets, Israel attacked {{the town of}} Karameh, Jordan, {{the site of a}} major PLO camp. The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians, which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev, killing two children. However, plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus attack. When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was led to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> similar situation. Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces. This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces. The Israelis were repelled {{at the end of a}} day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners. Both sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved. However, the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis. Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit. Some have alleged that Arafat himself was on the battlefield, but the details of his involvement are unclear. However, his allies–as well as Israeli intelligence–confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|As a geopolitical region, the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> is {{the area}} {{captured}} from Syria and occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, territory which Israel annexed in 1981. This region includes the western two-thirds of the geological <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights,</b> {{as well as the}} Israeli-occupied part of Mount Hermon.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its strategic military importance, the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> is an important water resource, especially at the higher elevations, which are snow-covered {{in the winter and}} help sustain baseflow for rivers and springs during the dry season. The heights receive significantly more precipitation than the surrounding, lower-elevation areas. The occupied sector of the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> provides or controls {{a substantial portion of the}} water in the Jordan River watershed, which in turn provides a portion of Israel's water supply. The <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> supply 15% of Israel's water.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> {{are another}} exception, having been informally {{incorporated}} by Israel with the 1981 <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> Law. The UN Security Council declared {{this to be}} null and without any international legal effect. Israeli settlements in these areas are essentially subject {{to the laws of}} Israel rather than those of the Palestinian Authority.|$|E

25|$|From 1967 to 1982, {{the four}} areas were governed under the Israeli Military Governorate (also named as Occupied Arab territories by the UN). The IMG was {{dissolved}} in 1982, after the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. In the process, Israel handed the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> {{was incorporated into}} the Northern District by the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> Law, and West Bank continued to be administrated via the Israeli Civil Administration. Despite dissolving the military government, in line with Egyptian demands, the term Israeli-occupied territories remains in use, referring to the West Bank including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and Western <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> Between 1998 and 2012, the term Palestinian territories, Occupied was {{used to refer to}} territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|Two other sanctuaries {{that have}} been the subject of study by Israelis in the {{occupied}} <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> are Qalaat Bustra and Har Senaim.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the Knesset {{enacted the}} <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights</b> Law, ostensibly as a {{reaction}} to Syrian provocations. This extended the Israeli rule of law to the <b>Golan</b> <b>Heights.</b> (It was also thought to have been motivated by the recent US AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia.) This act was widely considered an informal annexation. It was criticized by the United States as a violation of the Camp David Accords and condemned by the UN Security Council in Resolution 497.|$|E
