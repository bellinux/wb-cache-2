5000|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> can be {{classified}} by the workshops that made them. Attic fishplates were manufactured in the Kerameikos district of Athens, Greece; Apulian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were manufactured in various workshops in Taranto (Taras) on the [...] "heel of the boot" [...] of Italy; Campanian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> come from {{the region of the}} Bay of Naples, Italy (There were fabrics in both Capua and Cumae (Kyme)); Paestan fabrics were made in Paestum (Poseidonia), south of Salerno, Italy (These are the only <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> signed by the artists, coming from the workshops of Python and Asteas.). <b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> were made in almost all South Italian ceramic fabrics except for those in Lucania (on the Gulf of Taranto, the [...] "arch of the boot" [...] of Italy).

5000|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> {{were first}} {{produced}} in Athens {{during the late}} fifth century BC. These Attic <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized by fish whose bellies are oriented towards the outside rim of the plate. In Athens the palette was restricted to red clay fabric and black gloss slip with rare uses of white overpainting. Later, Italiote Greek settlers in Southern Italy began to mass-produce more colorful <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> in Taranto (Greek [...] "Taras"), Paestum (Greek [...] "Poseidonia"), Capua (Etruscan [...] "Capue"), and Cumae (Greek [...] "Kyme"). The South Italian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized by decoration in which the fish's bellies are oriented towards the sauce cup {{at the center of}} the plate.|$|R

50|$|Heat waves {{can also}} damage rail roads, such as {{buckling}} and kinking rails, {{which can lead}} to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains. Sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink. Sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like Southern USA, parts of Canada, the Middle East, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{commentators}} have questioned this view, some claiming that <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were not missing at all, {{or that they}} were dislodged during the crash and fell into the river. Others assert that the <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> may have been missing either through common theft for scrap metal or through the shifting of the weakened bridge shortly before the accident. The Naxalites themselves have not claimed credit for the [...] "attack", and have never been known to target trains before. After derailment of Howrah Rajdhani Express, Indian Railways brought LHB coaches to System, However, due to prolonged CRS inspection over East Central Ghat Section (Gurpa-Gujhandi and Parasnath hill range), LHB allotment to Howrah Rajdhani Express was delayed by 7months 13Days.|$|R
50|$|The wares {{produced}} by these workshops were usually large elaborate vessels intended for mortuary use. The forms produced included volute kraters, loutrophoroi, paterai, oinochoai, lekythoi, <b>fish</b> <b>plates,</b> etc. The decoration of these vessels was red figure (with figures reserved in red clay fabric, while the background {{was covered in}} a black gloss), with overpainting (sovradipinto) in white, pink, yellow, and maroon slips.|$|R

50|$|Homemade food {{is still}} {{preferred}} by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced {{way of life}} pushes the new generation to eat out, Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or minced meat), often with or before rice or bulgur pilav accompanied by a salad or cacık (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (zeytinyağlı yemekler) instead of the soup, either {{before or after the}} main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or <b>fish</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The form of {{the plate}} was called a [...] "pinax" [...] or [...] "pinakion", meaning [...] "tablet," [...] because of its flat shape. The fish plate's form {{was that of a}} dimpled disk {{elevated}} on a pedestal, in other words, round and flat with a small cup in the center of plate designed to hold oil or sauce. Its rim was turned down, and often bears a decorative border, either spiraling waves, Greek key and meander motifs, or a wreath of laurel leaves. A <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> is almost always also elevated above table level by a pedestal foot. Plates of this form are known since Minoan times (Pre-Greek), but they were not decorated with fish {{until the end of the}} fifth century BC.|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Foraging by {{predatory fish}} {{is thought to}} be one of the primary {{ecological}} processes affecting the abundances of plants and animals in subtidal habitats. The importance of this process was assessed on the subtidal surfaces of urban structures (pontoons and pilings) that represent major coastal habitats for marine organisms. Fish feed with greater intensity on epibiota attached to pilings than pontoons and it was hypothesised that greater predation on pilings explained why the structure of epibiotic assemblages differs between these habitats. I predicted that the structure of epibiotic assemblages would develop differently between pilings and pontoons in the presence of <b>fish</b> (<b>plates</b> open to predation) but not in the absence of <b>fish</b> (<b>plates</b> inside exclusion cages). Results revealed large differences in abundance between pilings and pontoons that were largely independent of the caged and uncaged plates. Predation may be intense (as it appeared on pilings) but unimportant because it does not explain observed abundances of prey (epibiota between pilings and pontoons). S. D. Connell[URL]...|$|R

5000|$|Arbër {{decides to}} cook fish {{for the other}} housemates, in {{what turned out to}} be the wildest lunch they had in the Big Brother house. As they awaited the fish to be served, Mardiola and Ilda, who were facing each other, get in a verbal fight over Mardiola eating the salad from the bowl instead of taking it in her own plate. The {{argument}} escalates as Mardiola refuses to do so, claiming it tastes better from the [...] "common bowl". Ilda is disgusted but Mardiola reiterates by telling Ilda not to let the wine get over her head too quickly. The conversation degenerates as Ilda bullies Mardiola over her 162 cm height; however, the conflict erupts when Ilda tells Mardiola that she's not giving a good example to her daughter by walking around in underwear and lying in bed with other men. Mardiola throws her glass of water on Ilda's plate and then empties the bowl of salad on her head. Ilda smashes her glass of wine on Mardiola's back, but Mardiola responds by throwing the <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> at Ilda, barely missing her. All of the housemates separate and hold them back. After this Jerry Springer Show scenario, Mardiola decides to walk off the show, while Ilda remains inside. Four hours later, Ilda is given the news that the staff has decided to expel her.

50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of this antique center imported luxury pottery from Attic workshops for their domestic usage. Among the painted pottery discovered in Pistiros, vessels of krater and scyphos types predominate, while {{those of the}} kylix and pelike types are more uncommon. Scenes of everyday life, mythology, leisure, and games of the ancient Greeks are depicted on the vessels. Represented in more variety are black glazed pottery wares, including scyphoi, kanthaoroi, bowls and one-handled cups, kylices and various shapes of latter type, lekythoi, and <b>fish</b> <b>plates.</b> The import of luxurious Attic pottery in Pistiros was interrupted around the mid 3rd century BC. This trend is typical for the entire Thracian plain.|$|R
50|$|Some {{contend that}} <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were {{decorated}} {{with pictures of}} the seafood they were intended to hold. Most of them, however, {{have been found in}} mortuary contexts, so it might be surmised that the fish images could represent symbolic offerings for the dead. On the other hand, these plates could just as well be objects which were in popular use among the living, placed in tombs for the deceased to continue using in the hereafter. At any rate the small size of these plates could not realistically afford some of the large aquatic animals represented upon them, and the decoration must therefore be regarded as artistic or symbolic compositions rather than pictures of actual food items on the plates.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the symbiotic microbiota of the hexacoral Cirrhipathes lutkeni using traditional plate culture, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and 16 S rDNA characterization. FISH counts for the whole coral (holobiont) showed a major presence of gamma-Proteobacteria (22 %) and Actinobacteria (19 %), followed by gamma-Proteobacteria (14 %), Firmicutes (9 %), Cytophaga-Flavobacterium (7 %), beta-Proteobacteria (6 %) and Chloroflexi (2 %). In contrast to the diversity observed by <b>FISH,</b> <b>plate</b> cultures were found to be selective for gamma-Proteobacteria (22 cultures) with the exception of an Actinobacterium. The methods employed in this study detected 76 % of all microbes estimated by DAPI staining of C. lutkeni homogenates. The absence of zooxanthellae in this particular hexacoral was confirmed by PCR and spectrophotometry using fresh tissue isolated from the holobiont. This is the first study describing the microbial associations of shallow-water hexacorallia, which opens further insight into coral microbial ecology and may enhance the search for novel natural products in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Stocks Reservoir is {{situated}} amidst the Forest of Bowland {{in the upper}} reaches of the old river valley of the Hodder. The reservoir was built in 1927 for the Fylde Water Board who primarily supplied water to Blackpool. The objective of this study is to assess the degree and likelihood of fish ingress onto the fish plates at the present and proposed stocking densities. An additional aim is to evaluate the operational implications, and if necessary suggest methods of alleviating the problem. Three spheres of study have been undertaken to achieve these objectives, these being: 1. To selectively stock the reservoir and monitor the angling club catches in order to assess the total population, relating it to <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> losses and proposed stocking densities. 2. To monitor the fish taken from the fish plates and assess the reasons for their ingress. 3. To study the draw off tower and fish plates, and suggest ways of ameliorating or halting the loss of fish and consequent operational problems...|$|E
40|$|Tijekom lipnja 2014. godine nastavljena su arheološka iskopavanja na rimskoj vili smještenoj u uvali Soline otoka Sveti Klement (Pakleni otoci, Hvar). Ovogodišnja je kampanja imala cilj nastaviti proučavanje gospodarskog dijela vile unutar katastarske čestice 4319. U tu je svrhu u zapadnom i južnom produžetku sonde 11, iz 2013. godine, istražen novi prostor – sonda 14. Otkriven je nastavak kasnoantičke arhitekture, kao i popratni pokretni nalazi koji sugeriraju gospodarski karakter istraživanog prostora. Brojne kockice mozaika i znatni ulomci polikromnih zidnih freski indiciraju i stambene prostore, moguće iz ranije faze gradnje. The eighth {{season of}} the joint Croatian-American {{interdisciplinary}} investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement near Hvar took place in June 2014. The objective was to continue the excavation of the production area of the villa. One trench was excavated, trench 14 (extension of trench 11 from 2013), which extended over roughly 14 m 2 and contained 15 stratigraphic units. We documented segments of two roughly parallel walls in N-S direction and a poorly preserved mortar floor between them. Wall SU 14006 was {{the continuation of the}} wall 11012 found in 2013 and it extended further to the south, outside of the trench. It is 0. 60 m (2 Roman feet) wide and built of fairly regular stone ashlars, set in mortar. The other wall SU 14015 was 0. 20 m wide and of similar construction. The mortar floor had a subfloor of rough stones in thick mortar. Numerous fragments of wall plaster, some with traces of polychrome paint (red, white, black), were found in the layer above the mortar floor, together with some collapsed wall and roof building material. A very large number of white limestone tesserae of various sizes (86 % large, rectangular) was found in the six layers above the collapsed material and the floor. The ceramic finds include a fragment of a Hellenistic <b>fish</b> <b>plate,</b> late Roman African and Phocaean sigillata, Aegean and African kitchenware and amphorae. There were also numerous sherds of Roman dolia and several fragments of ceramic beehives. There were fragments of Roman glass and a small tessera of blue glass paste. Among the metal finds, there were 6 coins and a bronze ring. The most significant find was a complete, broken bronze pitcher, found in situ along the western face of wall SU 14006. There is evidence of continuing production and storage area. The findings of polychrome frescoes and fine tesserae indicate some residential spaces, which may be from an earlier, probably early imperial, building phase. Those spaces could have been re-purposed in late antiquity...|$|E
50|$|Acts of {{sabotage}} occurred {{throughout the}} country. For instance on the railways the rails and <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were removed.

In Totagamuwa, the wooden sleepers were set on fire which warped the rails. In numerous places telephone and telegraph wires were cut. In Egoda Uyana, the demonstrators invaded the station captured a train and uncoupled the engine so that the train could not leave. Buses particularly those of the Gamini Bus Co. Ltd. and the High Level Road Bus Co. Ltd. were stopped, stoned and smashed by the demonstrators. The principal bus routes were blocked with trees and other barriers so that military escorts were required. Bridges had their planks removed {{and in a few}} cases were dynamited.|$|R

On 7 July 2015, Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique while putting the responsibility of the incident on the deceased driver revealed that the train incident occurred due to over-speeding. He also reiterated that Chawan bridge and the railway track was perfectly fine. However, an investigation team found some bolts and <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> approximately some 400 meters away from the accident spot along with some frictional scratches on the track which contradicts the statement by Rafique.|$|R
