5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such {{in the paper that}} described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1626 the {{southern}} {{threat to the}} Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by Swedish forces reignited the Polish–Swedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gdańsk (Danzig). Having taken Piława and Braniewo, Swedish forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, Elbląg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starograd, while other Swedish forces landed near Puck—the main port of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet—and captured it. The major city of Gdańsk, however, refused to surrender <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of lightning Swedish advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 {{near the village of}} Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements {{from other parts of the}} country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the Swedish incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put too much of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E
50|$|On 12 March, the Citadel of Turin {{fell into}} the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel {{encouraged}} Charles Albert and Cesare Balbo to negotiate with the Carbonari, who refused to listen to their messages. Thus, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of <b>the</b> spreading military uprising, <b>the</b> king abdicated <b>in</b> favour of his brother Charles Felix.

25|$|For simple, low-powered loads {{such as a}} {{neon lamp}} or a LED, a fixed {{resistor}} is commonly used.

25|$|Another {{example of}} AMC's agility was {{the ability of}} {{management}} to squeeze money out of reluctant bankers, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of bankruptcy. These core abilities helped save the company from collapse and after each obstacle, give it the wherewithal to keep it operating. Ironically, AMC was never stronger than just before its demise.|$|E

40|$|According to Susan Wolf's hybrid {{view about}} meaning in life, a life is {{meaningful}} in virtue of subjective attraction to objectively valuable pursuits.

25|$|His {{opposition}} to the trials was strongly criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike, and it is sometimes given as {{the main reason for}} his failure to secure the Republican nomination for president.

5000|$|In 1927, {{he served}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French Army <b>in</b> Morocco, where his pacifist views were {{reinforced}} by the brutal colonialist repression and military corruption he witnessed.

50|$|Al-Walid did {{not limit}} himself to taxing the Copts' finances; he also taxed their patience. He {{publicly}} reviled Jesus and once, during a procession, he <b>even</b> spat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{of an image}} of the Virgin Mary. When the Copts protested to the Caliph about the level of taxation he responded with more seizure of property and higher taxes. Such behavior continued under Al-Walid's successors.

25|$|Swiss {{historian}} Jean-Claude Favez, {{who conducted}} an 8-year {{review of the}} Red Cross records, says {{that even though the}} Red Cross knew by November 1942 about the Nazi’s annihilation plans for the Jews – and even discussed it with U.S. officials – the group did nothing to inform the public, maintaining silence <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of pleas by Jewish groups.|$|E
25|$|Shipments of Jews to {{the camps}} had {{priority}} over {{anything but the}} army's needs on the German railways, and continued <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the increasingly dire military situation {{at the end of}} 1942. Army leaders and economic managers complained about this diversion of resources and the killing of skilled Jewish workers, but Nazi leaders rated ideological imperatives above economic considerations.|$|E
25|$|By 1950, U.S. Secretary of Defense Louis A.

50|$|<b>In</b> general <b>the</b> {{scientific}} method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological {{questions about the}} universe that can be observed and measured.

Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as de facto verities in general parlance, such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution.|$|R
