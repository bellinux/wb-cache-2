Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} analyzes how consumers {{decide between}} <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> fixed price, an ascending auction or a BIN auction. We find that such entry decisions depend both on potential payoffs (price aspects) and consumer characteristics (non-price aspects). For values smaller {{than or equal}} to BIN prices, subjects are more likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves bidding. Conversely, for values greater than BIN prices, subjects are more likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves immediate buying. We further find that price aspects mainly play a role for values greater than BIN prices, whereas non-price aspects play a role for values smaller {{than or equal to}} BIN prices. Impatience makes subjects less likely to <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism involving bidding, whereas sensation seekingness and regret make subjects more likely to <b>enter</b> such <b>a</b> mechanism. Gender also has an impact on entry decisions...|$|R
