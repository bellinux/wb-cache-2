50|$|A pothead {{is a type}} of {{insulated}} {{electrical terminal}} used for transitioning between overhead line and underground high voltage cable or for connecting overhead wiring to equipment like transformers. Its name comes from the process of potting or encapsulation of the conductors inside the terminal's <b>insulating</b> <b>bushing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of a 9-inch (23 cm) long monopole antenna (quarter-wave for 330 megahertz (MHz) frequencies, but able to also act as half-wave or full-wave, the accounts differ) — a straight rod, led through an <b>insulating</b> <b>bushing</b> into a cavity, where it was terminated with a round disc that formed one plate of a capacitor. The cavity was a high-Q round silver-plated copper [...] "can", with the internal diameter of 0.775 in (19.7 mm) and about 11/16 in (17.5 mm) long, with inductance of about 10 nanohenry. [...] Its front side was closed with a very thin (3 mil, or 75 micrometers) and fragile conductive membrane. In {{the middle of the}} cavity was a mushroom-shaped flat-faced tuning post, with its top adjustable to make it possible to set the membrane-post distance; the membrane and the post formed a variable capacitor acting as a condenser microphone and providing amplitude modulation (AM), with parasitic frequency modulation (FM) for the re-radiated signal. The post had machined grooves and radial lines into its face, probably to provide channels for air flow to reduce pneumatic damping of the membrane. The antenna was capacitively coupled to the post via its disc-shaped end. The total weight of the unit, including the antenna, was 1.1 ounces (31 grams).|$|E
50|$|Since the 1965s, resin {{materials}} {{have been used}} for all types of bushing up to the highest voltages. The flexibility of using a castable form of insulation has replaced paper insulation in many product areas and dominates the existing <b>insulated</b> <b>bushing</b> market.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Superconducting {{equipment}} {{has been}} actively investigated for securing {{the environment and}} energy technology (ET) {{in various parts of}} the world. Despite these movements, a high voltage cryogenic bushing, which plays an important role of interconnection between the electric power systems and superconducting devices, has not been fully developed due to severe insulation requirements. A gas <b>insulated</b> cryogenic <b>bushing</b> has been investigated as one of our projects since 2010. As a basic step to obtain the design parameters for cryogenic bushing, we focused on the surface flashover characteristics of glass fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) in several insulation gases. For the surface flashover tests, several insulation gases including SF 6, CF 4 and N 2 gas were prepared. Various length of FRP specimens were fabricated in order to obtain the fundamental data for creepage distance of FRP. The first specimen group was from 2 mm to 10 mm with 2 mm intervals and the second specimen group was from 20 mm to 100 mm with 20 mm intervals. And the gas pressure was varied from 1 bar to 4 bar. An AC overvoltage test and a lightning impulse test were performed. Then the experimental results of surface flashover were obtained and analyzed. Based on these results, it would be possible to design the optimum creepage distance of FRP in a cryogenic bushing...|$|R
40|$|DE 29919142 U UPAB: 20010724 NOVELTY - An <b>insulating,</b> tubular <b>bush</b> (26) is {{inserted}} into the nozzle tip at the outlet of the plasma channel (12). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: The bush is ceramic, Near the outlet, the nozzle channel tapers conically. The upstream end of the bush {{is surrounded by a}} shoulder (24) of the casing, which serves as one electrode. Axial length of the plasma channel (12) from the electrode (18) tip to the upstream end of the bush, is at least twice the internal diameter of the bush. The axial length of the bush is at least twice its own internal diameter. USE - A plasma nozzle for treatment of plastics. An objective is e. g. plasma polymerization or plasma coating. ADVANTAGE - Though this nozzle is of compact design, it treats large surface areas. The nozzle bush alters the plasma jet, varying it from candle-flame geometry. Just inside the bush and beyond, the flame widens out, fan-like. The working gas is swirled ahead of the nozzle outlet, hence stabilizing rotary motion is maintained. The result is large-area, uniform plasma treatment of the workpiece surface. On the workpiece the plasma swirls outwardly, expanding radially. Centrally the vortex creates pressure reduction. The plasma is sucked down onto the surface, into intimate contact. This promotes very efficient treatment. Other effects at work include conventional gas acceleration stemming from intense heating and thermal expansion; also flow separation effects at the nozzle, which enhance jet spreading...|$|R
