40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the impact of the client-clinician interaction in the hearing aid adoption process. The specific goals of this dissertation were: 1) to identify factors in client-clinician interactions that were perceived by clients and clinicians to influence hearing aid adoption in first time adult hearing aid candidates, 2) to investigate the importance of the identified factors from clients and clinicians perspectives, and 3) to compare the importance of the identified factors between clients and clinicians. These goals were achieved using a mixed-methods approach. Three studies were undertaken. In the first study a concept mapping approach was used to explore the collective views of clients and clinicians in identifying factors in client-clinician interaction that influence hearing aid adoption. Ten audiologists and 13 clients generated 122 statements that formed eight conceptually homogenous clusters of factors. The concepts were: 1) ensuring client comfort, 2) understanding and meeting client needs, 3) client-centered traits and actions, 4) acknowledging client as an individual, 5) imposing undue pressure and discomfort, 6) <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, 7) supporting choices and shared decision making, and 8) factors in client readiness. In the second study, nine audiologists and 11 clients who participated in the first study rated the importance of the 122 statements. Clients rated the concept <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician more important than audiologists. In the third study, a broad and geographically diverse sample of clients and clinicians including audiologists and hearing instrument practitioners rated the importance of the 122 items identified in the first study. The comparison of the client and clinician groups’ ratings revealed discrepancies between the groups’ ratings. The largest discrepancy was between the importance each participant group assigned to the concepts <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, which was rated much higher by clients and factors in client readiness, which was rated much higher by clinicians. This work contributes to the literature on client-clinician interaction in the audiological encounter. Results have implications for training of students and clinicians in facilitating the integration of shared decision making and client-centered care in hearing aid adoption process...|$|R

40|$|During {{the surface}} {{treatment}} of workpieces {{by means of}} electron beams, several areas must often be treated. The energy applied causes the austenitizing of the edge layer of a workpiece. As a result of cooling, the austenite in converted into martensite and causes hardening, this {{is also known as}} self-quenching. During the hardening of several surfaces, the hardening of the next layer requires a high cycle time before it can cool down to ambient temperature. The time required is to be reduced. As is already known, no cooling medium, e. g. water is to be used; this would lead to corrosion or would disturb the vacuum process. According to the invention, the workpieces are exposed to a stream of cooling gas in a cooling station at atmospheric pressure after a surface is hardened by means of the electron beam; at intervals, an atomozing liquid is injected into the stream of cooling gas.

Quantitative {{prediction}} of screw auger performance requires better understanding and measurement of bulk particle-to-particle and particle-to-geometry interactions.

The objective {{of this study was to}} calibrate DEM corn modeling using Angle of Repose (AOR) and to simulate DEM corn flow in a commercial screw auger. Experimental data was collected to characterize harvested corn, angle of repose, and grain flow from a screw auger. Corn particle was modeled using four types of DEM spheres represented as 1 -sphere and clumped spheres 2 -sphere, 5 -sphere and 13 -sphere matching to a physically measured corn shape with equivalent geometrical diameter, 2 D axial dimension, 3 D axial dimension, and parameterized CAD dimensions, respectively. For each DEM corn shape approximation, virtual Design Of Experiments (DOE) with four DEM material interaction coefficients as independent parameters and reproducing AOR test initial conditions were developed in EDEM to simulate AOR grain flow behavior. AOR values from quasi-static corn flow on flat plate were measured in lab and compared with the DOE DEM simulation. The DEM corn with 2 -sphere and the material interaction coefficients showed good prediction to the experimental corn AOR test with minimum corn height test and DEM prediction difference of Mean Square Error (MSE) (5. 31 mm 2) compared to 1 -sphere, 5 -sphere and 13 -spheres.

The working width is 1 m. The working depth is suitable until 30 cm. The speed has been 2 m/s with working capability of 0. 72 ha/h and with speed of 3 m/s the working capability has been 1. 08 ha/h. The ribbon conveyer, completely closed and sealed, it performs the soil transport to the hopper of the rotating oven. The rotating oven is formed from a rotating cylinder with length of 2. 500 mm, with a diameter of 500 mm and with angular speed = 3. 2 1 /s. A burner, situated at the extremity of the cylinder, it produces a flame along the cylinder axis. It produces a temperatures distribution inside the cylinder that has been determined by mean a thermodynamic study of the considered process. The soil carried upward by the ribbon conveyor, in around 3 s, it comes in the hopper of the rotating cylinder. It moves toward the cylinder outlet, because of the inclination and rotating motion of the cylinder, advancing in counter-current to the heat propagation. Besides the soil, because of the rotating motion of the cylinder considered, is dragged upward for then reverting in the low part of the cylinder, with further soil breaking up. This is also made easy because there is a metallic fin on the cylinder inside surface. Under such operative conditions the heat transfer in the soil is facilitated and therefore it increases the effectiveness of the soil disinfectant treatment during the range time when it crosses the whole length of the cylinder. It has been seen that with the values used of speed during the tests, it is avoided the “cooking” of the contained clay in the considered soil. On the soil samples treated in such way, physical, chemical and microbiological analysis have been performed, and satisfactory data results have been obtained {{from the point of view}} of the performed treatment. Besides a moisture loss has been noticed of about 3 - 4 % while macroscopically burnt and pulverized zones and reduction of organic substance are not been underlined.
