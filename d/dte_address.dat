40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} {{the manner in}} which IS-IS is used to support pure OSI environments. Enhancements for support of IP and multi-protocol environments have been specified [4, 5], but are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. NOTE: The ISO term for a router is an "intermediate system". IS-IS is so named because it is a protocol which runs between routers. In other words, it is an "intermediate system to intermediate system" (or IS to IS) protocol. In this paper, the terms "router", "intermediate system", and "IS" are used interchangeably. IS-IS provides an "intra-domain" routing protocol. That is, it provides a standard for routing within a routing domain. The boundaries of routing domains are defined by network management, by setting some links to be "external domain". If a link is marked as "external domain", no IS-IS routing messages are sent on that link. ISO has not yet completed a standard for inter-domain routing. The OSI Inter-domain routing protocol is currently at the "commitee draft" stage [6], and is expected to become a full standard before the end of 1992. However, the inter-domain routing protocol is not yet widely available in products. Instead, manual configuration is used. The link is statically configured with the set of address prefixes reachable via that link, and with the method by which they can be reached (such as the <b>DTE</b> <b>address</b> to be dialed to reach that address, or the fact that the <b>DTE</b> <b>address</b> should be extracted from the IDP portion of the ISO address). OSI IS-IS routing makes use of two-level hierarchical routing. A routing domain is partitioned into "areas". Level 1 routers know the topology in their area, including all routers and end systems in their area. However, level 1 routers do not know the identity of routers or destinations outs [...] ...|$|E
50|$|The LMI global {{addressing}} extension gives Frame Relay data-link {{connection identifier}} (DLCI) values global rather than local significance. DLCI values become <b>DTE</b> <b>addresses</b> that are {{unique in the}} Frame Relay WAN. The global addressing extension adds functionality and manageability to Frame Relay internetworks. Individual network interfaces and the end nodes attached to them, for example, can be identified by using standard address-resolution and discovery techniques. In addition, the entire Frame Relay network {{appears to be a}} typical LAN to routers on its periphery.|$|R
50|$|Address field - In LAPB, {{this field}} has no meaning since the {{protocol}} {{works in a}} point to point mode and the <b>DTE</b> network <b>address</b> is represented in the layer 3 packets. This byte is therefore put to a different use; it separates the link commands from the responses and can have only two values: 0x01 and 0x03. 01 identifies frames containing commands from DTE to DCE and responses to these commands from DCE to DTE. 03 is used for frames containing commands from DCE to DTE and for responses from DTE to DCE. Therefore, one side must be configured as a Layer 2 DTE and the other as a Layer 2 DCE (you must not confuse this with the more familiar Layer 1 DCE and DTE designations).|$|R
