25|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the masnavi of the Ottoman {{period is}} that they almost always possess, beneath the literal meaning, a subtle spiritual signification. Many poems, of Mesnevi of Mevlana and the Divan of Aşık Paşha examples of confessedly religious, moral, or mystic but a much larger number are allegorical. To this latter class belong almost all the long romantic mesnevis of the Persian and mid Ottoman poets; in {{the stories of the}} loves of Leyla and Mecnun, Yusuf and Zuleykha, Kusrev and Shavin, Suleyman and Ebsal, and a hundred of like kind, can see pictured, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> beneath the surface, the soul of man for God, or the yearning of the human heart after heavenly light and wisdom. There is not a character introduced into those romances but represents the passion not an incident but has some spiritual meaning. In the history of Iskender, or Alexander, we watch the noble human soul in its struggles against the powers of this world, and, when aided by God and guided by the heavenly wisdom of righteous teachers, its ultimate victory over every earthly passion, and its attainment of that point of divine serenity whence it can look calmly down on all sublunary things.|$|E

500|$|... "Hero" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written by Mariah and produced by her and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting {{it over to the}} soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R melody, as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though we may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, we are [...] "heroes" [...] <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> inside ourselves and see our own inner strength; in time, it will help us [...] "find the way." ...|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

2500|$|Zhang {{felt that}} yinming, or the {{knowledge}} of reasons, enabled people to recover {{the true meaning of}} Mohist and Confucian tests in ways that Western philosophy could not. Zhang’s decision to frame his comparative inquiry in terms of yinming demonstrates his belief in yinming as a more effective 'art of reasoning' than either the 'Mohist Canons' or European logic. In his essay Discussion on the Equalization of Things, Zhang uses Yogacara Buddhist concepts to make sense of Zhuangzi, an ancient Daoist philosopher. He claims that Zhuangzi's notion of equality entails making distinctions without the use of concepts: 'Equalizing things’ (qiwuzhe) refers to absolute equality (pingdeng). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at its meaning carefully, it does not simply refer to seeing sentient beings as equal...One must speak form (xiang, laksana) without words, write of form without concepts (ming) and think form without mind. It is ultimate equality. This accords with the 'equalization of things.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The alleged {{intention}} of the law, which was published during World War I, was a [...] "temporary movement of the Ottoman citizens" [...] during the conflicts and not the permanent displacement as there was a decree (regulation, or adjunct) {{with respect to the}} relocated citizens by the [...] "Tehcir Law" [...] who wanted to return; it claimed [...] "except those people , no one else will be touched." [...] Also <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the fourth section of the Tehcir law, it was specifically designed to hold the enforcer units responsible to follow up and record the properties owned by the subjects of the immigration. The law included a responsible party for the protection of properties the owners could/will return in a later term. Another law was passed to regulate the enforcement of this section On 10 June 1915. In this section, it was demanded that there would be three copies of this information; one kept in the regional churches, one in the regional administration, and one kept by the commission responsible for the execution of the law.

2500|$|The {{economies of}} the world have {{developed}} unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis.
