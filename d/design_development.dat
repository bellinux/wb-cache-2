5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system <b>design.</b> <b>Development</b> of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

5|$|It {{also became}} clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch {{facilities}} in Florida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. The <b>design,</b> <b>development</b> and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.|$|E

Although the implications for different approaches to teamwork for <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> are discussed, we highlight models for developing teams that are especially useful to those who are new to the field. We conclude with challenges faced by <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> teams specifically in regard to educational communications and technology. <b>Design</b> and <b>development</b> teams should: (1) organize in ways informed by the research, (2) access and apply research on teaching and learning, (3) conduct research for ongoing evaluation of technology in education, and (4) contribute to the research in the field from their own innovations, mindful of the social consequences of <b>design</b> and <b>development...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Social Web Application (SWA) <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> is {{a complex}} process that {{requires}} the understanding and coordination of several domains of knowledge. Yet there remain few if any holistic frameworks to manage this process. In this paper we present such a framework, R 4. It coordinates and relates the different perspectives that inform the entire SWA <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> process. We base R 4 on SWA <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> framework requirements derived from the literature. We formulate and relate four basic perspectives, the User, Culture, Technology and Business spheres and define stages, (Re) Design, Realization and Reformation (RRR), of the entire SWA <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> lifecycle. We then suggest basic SWA <b>design</b> and <b>development</b> guidelines derived from our R 4 framework and develop an example methodology based on that framework.
