40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{discharge}} of the greenhouse gas CO 2, the use of biomass is nowadays promoted as fuel in boilers. Compared to boilers fired with coal and oil the biomass-fired boilers have more complications related to both fouling and corrosion <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces. After the combustion, unburned inorganic matter in state of vapour, melts and solid particles are transported in the flue gas and may form <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces. <b>Deposits</b> <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces may result in both increasing corrosion and decreasing boiler efficiency as the heat transfer rate to the superheaters and reheaters decrease by deposits. In order to understand the process of deposit build-up, the whole combustion and transport process had to be analysed including aspects such as, boiler design, fuel properties and combustion environment, followed by particle transport phenomena and the probability for particles to get stuck <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> tubes. In this thesis numerical simulation of particle trajectories has been conducted as well as measurements of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> a special designed deposit probe followed by investigation of on-site measurements of <b>deposit</b> depth <b>on</b> the super-heater tubes in a circulating fluidised bed in Västerås, Sweden. Numerical simulations of particle trajectories in the vicinity of two super-heater tubes were conducted in an Eulerian-Lagrangian mode considering the flue gas and ash particles phase. Particle impingements on the tubes were investigated for different particle sizes. The results from the particle trajectory simulations show that particle larger than 10 µm will mainly impinge on the windward side of the first tube but, however also {{on the sides of the}} second tube in the flue gas flow direction. In theory as well as from observations and measurements two tubes can merge together by the deposit build-up. Smaller particles are usually more dispersed due to turbulence and thermophorectic forces, resulting in a more even impingement distribution on the whole surface of the tubes. Probe measurements reveal that the deposit layer growth rate have a significant temperature and time dependence. After the initial deposit build-up a sintering process occurs and sintering is also proven to be dependent on temperature and exposure time. Soot-blowing is the most common method to reduce the effect of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> tubes. In the present thesis the soot boiling efficiency is therefore also investigated. The soot-blowing show a strong positive effect <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> rate in a short time (hours) perspective after a soot-blowing cycle is completed. This positive effect is much weaker when considering a time period of three years. This is an effect of fact that soot-blowing mostly remove the loose part of the deposit material leaving the hard sintered part unaffected. The subject of <b>deposit</b> build up <b>on</b> superheater tubes in large scale boilers involves multi-discipline knowledge and historically, the related research is mostly conducted as measurements and experiments on operating plants.

40|$|This {{is a short}} {{review on}} {{fluidised}} bed combustion of biomass. At present most biomass fuels are prepared from wastes, mainly originating from agriculture and forest. The transport of this voluminous material to a plant sets a limitation on the plant size, whose role then is mostly within industrial and heating systems. Co-combustion with fossil fuels amplifies the use of biomass combustion to utility boilers. Fluidized bed boilers are built for biomass combustion both in circulating and non-circulating mode. Combustion of biomass is a mixing problem, which is solved by stirring with secondary air in a sufficiently high combustion chamber. Once the volatiles are successfully burnt, the remaining emission of concern is nitrogen oxide, because the sulphur content in the fuel is low. The principal problem of biomass combustion is formation of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces and bed agglomeration caused by high potassium and chlorine contents in some fuels. Modification of the bed material may help: alumina-silicates have shown to alleviate the agglomeration-sintering problem, typically encountered with silica sand as bed material...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of western subbituminous coals has generated concerns regarding highly reflective ash disrupting heat transfer in the radiant zone of pulverized-fuel boilers. Ash emissivity and reflectivity is primarily a function of ash particle size, with reflective deposits expected to consist of very small refractory ash materials such as CaO, MgO, or sulfate materials such as Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }. For biomass fuels and biomass-coal blends, similar reflectivity issues may arise {{as a result of}} the presence of abundant organically associated calcium and potassium, which can transform during combustion to fine calcium, and potassium oxides and sulfates, which may act as reflective ash. The relationship of reflectivity to ash chemistry is a second-order effect, with the ash particle size distribution and melting point being determined by the size and chemistry of the minerals present in the starting fuel. Measurement of the emission properties of ash and deposits have been performed by several research groups (1 - 6) using both laboratory methods and measurements in pilot- and full-scale combustion systems.

These problems are fuel, system design, and operating condition dependent. Conventional slag and ash removal methods include the use of in situ blowing or jet-type devices such as air or steam soot blowers and water lances. Pulse detonation technology for the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. The detonation wave technique based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock <b>on</b> the slag <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. These detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits.

To hold the slag deposit samples at the exit of detonation tube, two types of fixture was designed and fabricated. They are axial arrangement and triangular arrangement. The slag deposits from the utility boilers have been used to prepare the slag samples for the test. The experimental results show that the single shot detonation wave is capable of removing the entire slag (types of slag <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> economizer, and air-heater, i. e., relatively softer slags) and 30 % of the reheater slag (which is harder) even at a distance of 6 in. from the exit of a detonation engine tube.

40|$|Fouling can {{be defined}} as the {{formation}} of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces that impede heat transfer and increase the resistance to fluid flow. The presence of fouling deposits result in the loss of equipment efficiency, the loss of equipment utilization, the requirement of additional capital expenditures, and adds the cost of cleaning to a process. The cost of fouling to all industries using heat exchangers in the United States was estimated to be 2 x 10 + 1 dollars per year in 1995. Thus, the control or mitigation of fouling is critical to all industries which employ heat transfer equipment. In this work, a simplified transient heat transfer resistance fouling measurement apparatus was designed and a simplified analysis protocol was formulated. The design of the apparatus was optimized through first order parametric modeling and finite difference modeling of the system. A solvent evaporation technique was utilized to deposit a film of known thickness and thermal conductivity inside the apparatus. Testing results, from before and after fouling deposition, indicate that the apparatus and analysis protocol were capable of measuring fouling thermal resistances of 2. 6 m 2 K/W.

40|$|Brazed plate heat exchanges (BPHEs) and {{tube-in-tube}} {{heat exchangers}} (TTHEs) {{are commonly used}} in the refrigeration, air conditioning, and food industry as refrigerant-to-water condensers, in which refrigerant rejects heat to water circulating in cooling tower loops. These heat exchangers often suffer from severe fouling issues because as {{the water in the}} cooling tower evaporates, the mineral concentration in the remaining water increases. Once the solubility limits are reached, the minerals precipitate and <b>deposit</b> <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces: an undesirable yet unavoidable phenomenon. Due to the fouling <b>deposit</b> <b>on</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> surfaces, the thermal resistance between refrigerant and water gradually increases. The fouling resistance depends on several factors such as heat exchanger geometry, heat flux, water quality and water flow rates. The fouling factors penalize the overall effectiveness of the refrigerant condensers and thus must be properly accounted for during the equipment design. Predictions of the fouling allowances during the life service of the condenser characterize the degradation in thermal performance and provide guidelines about the maintenance and service of this type of equipment. In this work, a smooth TTHE was investigated by using a new experimental facility at Oklahoma State University. The aim was to measure the fouling resistance in real time and correlate the data with the water quality and heat flux inside the refrigeration condenser. The fouling resistance in the TTHE was observed to have asymptotic trend and the asymptotic limit was lower than that for BPHEs with soft corrugation angles and higher than that of BHPEs with hard corrugation angles operating at similar conditions. The hydraulic performance was similar as BPHEs with hard corrugation angles. The fouling deposit inside the tube-in-tube heat exchanger was further analyzed by using a CCD camera with a borescope probe and by adopting a chemical digestion process for the fouling particles inside the tubes. Fouling did not deposit uniformly inside the TTHE and it was evident that more fouling was present at the outlet section of the water side. The chemical analysis showed that more than 85 % of the fouling material was CaCO 3, which was expected from the chemical analysis of the water in critical saturation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Fireside {{deposits}} can {{be found}} in many types of utility and industrial furnaces. The deposits in furnaces are problematic because they can reduce heat transfer, block gas paths and cause corrosion. To tackle these problems, it is vital to estimate the influence of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> heat <b>transfer,</b> to minimize deposit formation and to optimize deposit removal. It is beneficial to have a good understanding of the mechanisms of fireside deposit formation. Numerical modeling is a powerful tool for investigating the heat transfer in furnaces, and it can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms of deposit formation. In addition, a sub-model of deposit formation is generally an essential part of a comprehensive furnace model. This work investigates two specific processes of fireside deposit formation in two industrial furnaces. The first process is the slagging wall found in furnaces with molten <b>deposits</b> running <b>on</b> the wall. A slagging wall model is developed {{to take into account the}} two-layer structure of the deposits. With the slagging wall model, the thickness and the surface temperature of the molten deposit layer can be calculated. The slagging wall model is used to predict the surface temperature and the heat transfer to a specific section of a super-heater tube panel with the boundary condition obtained from a Kraft recovery furnace model. The slagging wall model is also incorporated into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based Kraft recovery furnace model and applied on the lower furnace walls. The implementation of the slagging wall model includes a grid simplification scheme. The wall surface temperature calculated with the slagging wall model is used as the heat transfer boundary condition. Simulation of a Kraft recovery furnace is performed, and it is compared with two other cases and measurements. In the two other cases, a uniform wall surface temperature and a wall surface temperature calculated with a char bed burning model are used as the heat transfer boundary conditions. In this particular furnace, the wall surface temperatures from the three cases are similar and are in the correct range of the measurements. Nevertheless, the wall surface temperature profiles with the slagging wall model and the char bed burning model are different because the deposits are represented differently in the two models. In addition, the slagging wall model is proven to be computationally efficient. The second process is deposit formation due to thermophoresis of fine particles to the heat transfer surface. This process is considered in the simulation of a heat recovery boiler of the flash smelting process. In order to determine if the small dust particles stay on the wall, a criterion based on the analysis of forces acting on the particle is applied. Time-dependent simulation of deposit formation in the heat recovery boiler is carried out and the influence of <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> heat <b>transfer</b> is investigated. The locations prone to deposit formation are also identified in the heat recovery boiler. Modeling of the two processes in the two industrial furnaces enhances the overall understanding of the processes. The sub-models developed in this work can be applied in other similar deposit formation processes with carefully-defined boundary conditions...|$|R

It is, therefore, common practice to operate these units i. e. MSF under sub-atmospheric pressure to boil saline water below saturation temperature of which depositions occurs. However this comes with high price-tag for excessive use of energy for pumping. Alternative and environmentallyfriendly approach is to modify the surface at such that it could produce lager number of bubbles which cause high scale of turbulence. The present study aims at investigating experimentally the mechanism of crystallization fouling of finned tubes during nucleate pool boiling of CaSO 4 solutions. The investigated finned tubes are low finned tube type with fins density of 19 fins per inch, 1. 35 fins pitch, and Cu-Ni as substrate. Fouling runs during pool boiling of CaSO 4 were carried out at atmospheric pressure for different heat fluxes. A set of video recordings and pictures during clean and fouling runs were also used to interpret the fouling results. Experimental results showed that for the finned tubes: 1) substantial reduction of deposition occurred in comparison to those of stainless steel smooth tubes and 2) if any deposition builds-up on the finned tubes, then {{it is only a}} thin layer of crystals which can be easily removed. The superiority of finned tubes to stainless steel smooth tubes is due to the mechanism of bubble formation and detachment from the finned tubes that {{play a key role in}} reduction of CaSO 4 scale formation on the surface...|$|R

Moreover, the solution of the constraint equation requires the full quark propagator should be almost trivial (free-type) one, i. e. there is nontrivial quark propagator in the LA in QCD. This triviality results in the fact that the standard LA ignores the self-interaction between gluons caused by color charges (non-Abelian character of QCD).
