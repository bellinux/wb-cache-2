This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{picture of}} these pursuits was what Miss Overmore {{took refuge in}} when the child tried timidly to {{ascertain}} if her father were disposed to feel he had too much of her. She evaded the point and only kicked up all round it the dust of Ida's heartlessness and folly, of which the supreme proof, it appeared, {{was the fact that}} she was accompanied on her journey by a gentleman whom, to be painfully plain on it, she had--well, [...] "picked up." [...] The terms on which, unless they were married, ladies and gentlemen might, as Miss Overmore expressed it, knock about together, were the terms on which she and Mr. Farange had exposed themselves to possible misconception. She had indeed, as has been noted, often explained this before, often said to Maisie: [...] "I don't know what in the world, darling, your father and I should do without you, for you <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> difference, as I've told you, of keeping us perfectly proper." [...] The child took in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she performed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the event of her mother's giving her up. Familiar as she had grown with the fact of the great alternative to the proper, she felt in her governess and her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment. At the same time she had heard somehow of little girls--of exalted rank, it was true--whose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex, and she knew that if she were at school at Brighton it would be thought an advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters. She turned these things over and remarked to Miss Overmore that if she should go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor.|$|E
6000|$|... 186. I {{have only}} one thing more to advise you, namely, never to color petulantly or hurriedly. You will not, indeed, be able, if you attend {{properly}} to your coloring, to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch; nevertheless, {{if you do not}} dash or rush at your work, nor do it lazily, you may always get enough form to be satisfactory. An extra quarter of an hour, distributed in quietness {{over the course of the}} whole study, may <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> difference between a quite intelligible drawing, and a slovenly and obscure one. If you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of color is to have, and, when it is on the paper, guide it without nervousness, as far as you can, into the form required; and then, after it is dry, consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it, before laying one of them on; you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look, as compared with a hurried or ill-considered sketch. In no process that I know of--least of all in sketching--can time be really gained by precipitation. It is gained only by caution; and gained in all sorts of ways; for not only truth of form, but force of light, is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colors. You may often make a simple flat tint, rightly gradated and edged, express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch. The two Swiss cottages, for instance, with their balconies, and glittering windows, and general character of shingly eaves, are expressed in Fig. 30 with one tint of gray, and a few dispersed spots and lines of it; all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush, and without a single touch after the tint is dry.|$|E
