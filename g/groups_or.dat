5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or in <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> clusters on the ground. It {{can also}} grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It {{has been reported}} from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs.

The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in <b>groups,</b> <b>or</b> in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} {{swallows}}, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> with other swallows and swifts. They feed low over {{a variety of}} open habitats or woodland. Prey items recorded for the Mascarene martin include scarab, click and other beetles, Hemiptera and flying ants, and Brazza's martins will take termites. In eastern Africa, areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting by Brazza's martins.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|French Air Forces {{under the}} command of Commandant des Forces (Commander of Forces) Marcel Têtu Aeriennes de Cooperation du Front Nord-Est (Ardennes Cooperation Front North East, or FACNE) rarely {{supported}} the British efforts despite substantial reinforcements. They flew only an average of one sortie per day, including strategic defensive missions. One reason for this was heavy French bomber losses on the previous two days. During the Battle of Maastricht in the Netherlands, the Groupement de Bombardement (Bomber <b>Groups,</b> <b>or</b> GB) had its squadrons reduced. GB I/12 and II/12 had only 13 LeO 451s between them. Groupement de Bombardement d'Assaut 18 (GBA 18) had only 12 of 25 Breguet 693s left. GB I/34 and II/34 could muster eight aircraft out of 22 Amiot 143s, I/38 seven out of 12, and II/38 six out of 11. All of these groups were sent to Sedan on 14 May. Escort was given from Groupement de Chasse (Fighter <b>Groups,</b> <b>or</b> GC). GC III/7 with 12 Morane 406s, 12 Bloch 152s of I/8 and nine Dewoitine D.520s of I/3 took part. GBA 18 was escorted by 15 Bloch 152s of GC I/8. The missions cost the French five bombers, two from ground fire. After this date, the French bomber forces were eliminated from the fight over Sedan. The major efforts were now made by the AASF.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in <b>groups,</b> <b>or</b> {{clusters}} on the ground.

It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E

5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in <b>groups,</b> <b>or</b> clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major <b>groups</b> <b>or</b> lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
