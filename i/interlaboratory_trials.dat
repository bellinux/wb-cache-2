40|$|Two {{international}} <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials</b> for {{the analysis}} of growing media and soil improvers were performed. Samples of white sphagnum peat, coir dust, composted green material, uncomposted bark, peat mixture and a peat and clay mixture were tested. Of the materials the pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content and ash, dry matter content, moisture content, laboratory compacted bulk density, dry bulk density, air volume, water volume, shrinkage value and total pore space were determined using European Standards. The results give an idea about the excitability and reliability of the methods. Results were variable. As a reference a test performed for European standardization was used. Results less good as obtained in the former trial were found for the pH of bark. This appeared to be a difficult material for the pH determination. Also the repeatability and reproducibility results of the organic matter determination of the peat and clay mixture were bad. This can either be caused by the fact that laboratories do not exactly follow the procedure, or the method is more reliable for high organic matter contents and should perhaps be adapted for materials with a low organic matter content. The laboratory compacted bulk density results of the performed test are in most cases satisfactory. The determination of physical parameters were not always good. The repeatability and reproducibility of dry bulk density of composted green material were extremely high. Probably due to the constitution of this compost, dry bulk density is difficult to determine. The method is not suitable for this type of material. Results for bark and peat and clay mixture are also rather poor. For particle density it appeared that some laboratories used another formula as prescribed. Next trial and an amendment will have to be made about how total pore space has to be calculated from particle density. For water and air volume the repeatability and reproducibility results of one of the <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials</b> were not good when compared to the former trial. There is not a clear reason but perhaps laboratories need to gain more experience for these determinations. The results show that it is essential to have <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials</b> for the physical and chemical characterization of growing media and soil improvers. The procedures still need further improvement. The only way to find out for a laboratory if it is producing the right data, is to participate in these trials.

Data were collected in an interlaboratory study by 11 participating laboratories located in Europe and North America. General qualitative method performance was examined using suitability descriptors (i. e. resolution, selectivity, migration times and S/N), while precision was determined by quantification of variances in the determination of R-timolol at four different impurity levels in S-timolol maleate samples. The <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials</b> were designed {{in accordance with the}} ISO guideline 5725 - 2.

The SBV epizootic wave has declined, but infectious SBV in SBV RNA–positive semen remains a possible risk for the distribution of SBV. However, the abilities of SBV molecular detection methods used at European laboratories have not yet been assessed, to our knowledge. The performances of extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) methods used at 27 German and 17 other European laboratories for SBV RNA detection in the matrices of whole blood, serum, tissue homogenate, RNA eluates, and bovine semen were evaluated in 2 <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials</b> with special emphasis on semen extraction methods. For reliable detection of viral genome in bovine semen samples, highly effective extraction methods are essential to cope with the potential inhibitory effects of semen components on PCR results. All methods used by the 44 laboratories were sufficiently robust to detect SBV RNA with high diagnostic sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (95. 8 %) in all matrices, except semen. The trials demonstrated that the published recommended semen extraction methods (Hoffmann et al. 2013) and a combination of TRIzol LS with an alternative extraction kit have a considerably higher diagnostic sensitivity to detect SBV RNA in semen up to a detection limit of Cq ≤ 35 compared to other extraction methods used.

Due to {{the flexibility of the}} laser technique concerning the machining process and the materials processed, a large number of various emission substances are generated. In the field of particle filtration, selected self-cleaning filters have been investigated. It could be shown, that for most of the laser machining processes and materials processed self-cleaning filters are suitable systems. In the field of gas filtration, adsorption on activated charcoal and biofiltration have been investigated. With the exception of highly volatile substances most of the substances were filtered by the charcoal with an efficiency of about 90 %. The filtration efficiency observed for the biofilter is more than 80 % for mixtures of substances with low complexity. For complex mixtures of substances and particles the results were not homogeneous. Beside the technical activities, the project contained the coordination of the European project EU 643 Safety-INDAL.

40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic food {{contaminants}} {{that are}} naturally produced by certain fungi. They induce {{negative effects on}} human health by making food unsafe for consumption. In this study, analyses were performed to determine the levels and incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in peanut products, tree nuts, spices, and Coix seeds; ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat and roasted coffee, as well as OTA and AFs in rice; and citrinin (CIT) in red yeast rice (RYR) products. A total of 712 samples from nine different food categories were collected between 2012 and 2013. The samples were analyzed over 2 years for AFs, OTA, and CIT by methods recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These official analytical methods were extensively validated in-house and through <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials.</b> The analytical values of suspected contaminated specimens were confirmed by liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the specific mycotoxin present in the sample. We show that 689 samples (96. 8 %) complied with the regulations set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. AFs were found in four peanut-candy products, one peanut-flour product, one pistachio product, one Sichuan-pepper product, and one Coix seed product.

40|$|DNA/RNA-based {{methods for}} food {{analysis}} {{have emerged from}} the laboratory and are becoming integrated into regular analytical usage. Problems remain in the standardisation of procedures between laboratories, and the often highly variable nature of template DNA preparation. Quality control is essential in the food industry and efficient quality assurance is becoming increasingly important. Food analytical researchers are increasingly asking for efficient control methods, in particular through up to date quality sensors, firstly to satisfy the consumer and regulatory requirements and secondly to improve the production feasibility, quality sorting, automation and reduction of production cost and production time. Therefore, all three drivers of the quality control, consumers, authorities and food producers, have great interest {{in the development of}} new sensing systems which are beyond the existing on-line technologies. The molecular based analytical technique offers the advantages of versatility and extreme sensitivity. This work is based on three main issues. These include: DNA based methods for detection of food-borne pathogens, detection of risk material in food chain and identification of various animal species in food and feed matrices. The first issue was done under cooperation with an European network-research project (Food PCR). The aim of this project was to validate and standardize the use of diagnostic PCR for the detection of foodborne pathogens. The plan of Food-PCR was to devise noncommercial and nonpatented, standardized PCR-based detection methods for five major pathogens: E. coli O 157, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. The role of the Institute of Veterinary Food Science, Giessen in this project was task leader for development and validation of a specific PCR assay for detection of E. coli O 157 to provide a diagnostic method which will be suitable for routine adoption and future proposal as a standard. This goal was preceeded in three phases. In phase 1, researchers working in expert laboratories have developed and selected promising candidate PCR-based methods, and tested them for efficiency and selectivity against comprehensive collections of reference strain DNA. The final selected PCR assays were optimized, and taken forward into phases 2 and 3. In phase 2, an interlaboratory trial was conducted to confirm the selectivity of the PCR assays. This phase will itself be conducted in two steps: in the first all reagents will be supplied by the originating laboratory, while in the second the participants will use their own. This provided a thorough evaluation of the efficiency and robustness of the PCR assays. In phase 3, the complete procedure comprising sample pre-treatment and the PCR assay (PCR-based method) will be subjected to <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trials,</b> to provide validated PCR-based pathogen detection protocols. The second issue was the detection of BSE risk material in food chain. For an efficient consumers protection, European legislation prohibited several bovine tissues encompassing mainly central nervous system tissues from food chain. A quantitative real-time RT-PCR was designed to identify BSE risk material in meat and meat products. This was based on an mRNA assay that used bovine, ovine, and caprine glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) encoding gene sequences as a marker. The real time RT-PCR assay included a housekeeping gene as an endogenous control. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR detection of GFAP mRNA appeared to be useful as a routine diagnostic test for the detection of illegal use of CNS tissues in meat and meat products. The stability of the specific region of GFAP mRNA allows the detection of CNS tissues also after meat processing steps. This region was protected by an international patent. The third issue is the identification of various animal species in food. Authentication of food starts at the species level of the used meat as raw material for other productions. Food authentication linked to problems of adulteration. Adulteration usually involves substituting high quality raw materials with cheaper ones. For prevention of mislabelling or undeclared admixture, either deliberate or accidental, PCR-RFLP, species specific primer and PCR sequencing have been adopted for the differentiation of snails, ostrich dog and cat species in food and feed matrices. These DNA based methods being highly sensitive, reproducible, rapid, simple and not expensive could be used even after heat treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mutation {{analysis}} of KIT and PDGFRA genes in gastrointestinal stromal tumors is gaining increasing importance for prognosis of GISTs and for prediction of treatment response. Several groups have identified specific mutational subtypes in KIT exon 11 {{associated with an}} increased risk of metastatic disease whereas GISTs with PDGFRA mutations often behave less aggressive. Furthermore, in advanced GIST disease with proven KIT exon 9 mutation the doubled daily dose of 800 mg imatinib increases the progression free survival and is now recommended both in the European and the American Guidelines. In Germany, there are still no general rules how to perform mutational analysis. Methods When comparing results from six different molecular laboratories we recognized the need of standardisation. Six German university laboratories with experience in mutation analysis in GISTs joined together to develop recommendations for the mutation {{analysis of}} the most common and clinically relevant hot spots, i. e.

30|$|The RL was {{verified}} {{according to}} ISO/TS 13530 [10] for untreated and treated real-world samples, {{in contrast to}} the EPA procedure where standard solutions are used. For the evaluation of the MCT 10  µg/L, perchlorate solutions were used (EPA 314.0 used 25  μg/L). In contrast to EPA, nitrate was added to the mixed matrix ions matrix to represent a composition of real-world samples. Despite the fact that all quality-control requirements were passed, this study did not confirm any benefit from the MCT regression method and the highest conductance method. According to the presented results, the rather complex MCT evaluation is not needed to evaluate if the chosen chromatographic conditions are suitable to determine trace levels of perchlorate and if sample preparation is needed. Hence, the impact of the major matrix anions on perchlorate recovery was investigated. None of the tested single matrix ion solutions provided a PD(A/H) above 20 %, although significant reduced perchlorate recovery was obtained. Samples with individual matrix anion concentrations of below 125  mg/L would allow the direct injection, and those above this value would need to be prepared accordingly.

Forty products (11 herbs, 17 spices, and 12 seasonings) were purchased from a local commercial source, and randomly selected samples were irradiated with 10 kGy. Four blended products were prepared at Scottish Universities Research and Reactor Centre, mixing varying proportions of irradiated material with the untreated product. Precharacterization against a predefined threshold identified low sensitivity products (black and white peppers) and products with high natural signals (thyme, sage, parsley, and mixed herbs), both of which might be susceptible to misclassification. Precharacterization also revealed whether calibration was likely to resolve overlap between classification categories. Eight sets of screening data and 5 sets of calibrated data were returned by participants. Of the 840 samples sent, 1593 screening measurements and 788 calibrated measurements were received from 662 samples. In screening mode, participants reached definitive conclusions in 87 % of cases, 99 % of which were correct. Of the remaining 13 %, calibration to identify low?sensitivity resolved 60 % of cases. Overall, 94 % of samples were correctly identified by either screening alone, or screening plus calibration; 6 % remained unclassified and therefore required further investigation by thermoluminescence. The results confirm {{the validity of the}} PSL method for herbs, spices, seasonings, and blends, and emphasize the need for calibration to identify low?sensitivity samples. This method has now been adopted by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission...|$|R
40|$|A {{workshop}} titled "Application of Genotyping Methods to Assess Pathogen Risks from Cryptosporidium in Drinking Water Catchments" {{was held}} at the International Water Association biennial conference, Marrakech, Morocco, 23 September 2004. The workshop presented and discussed the findings of an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trial</b> that compared methods for genotyping Cryptosporidium oocysts isolated from feces. The primary goal of the trial and workshop was to assess the utility of current Cryptosporidium genotyping methods for determining the public health significance of oocysts isolated from feces in potable-water-supply watersheds. An expert panel of 16 watershed managers, public health practitioners, and molecular parasitologists was assembled for the workshop. A subordinate goal of the workshop was to educate watershed management and public health practitioners. An open invitation was extended to all conference delegates to attend the workshop, which drew approximately 50 interested delegates. In this report we summarize the peer consensus emerging from the workshop. Recommendations on the use of current methods by watershed managers and public health practitioners were proposed. Importantly, all the methods that were reported in the trial were mutually supporting and found to be valuable and worthy of further utility and development. Where there were choices as to which method to apply, the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene was considered to be the optimum genetic locus to target. The single-strand conformational polymorphism method was considered potentially the most valuable for discriminating to the subtype level and where a large number of samples were to be analyzed. A research agenda for protozoan geneticists was proposed to improve the utility of methods into the future. Standardization of methods and nomenclature was promoted...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{labelling}} requirements {{of food and}} feed products containing materials derived from genetically modified organisms, quantitative detection methods have to be developed for this purpose, including the necessary certified reference materials and calibrator standards. To date, for most genetically modified organisms authorized in the European Union, certified reference materials derived from seed powders are being developed. Here, an assessment has been made on the feasibility of using plasmid DNA as an alternative calibrator for the quantitative detection of genetically modified organisms. For this, a dual-target plasmid, designated as pJANUS¿- 02 - 001, comprising part of a junction region of genetically modified soybean event GTS- 40 - 3 - 2 and the endogenous soybeanspecific lectin gene was constructed. The dynamic range, efficiency and limit of detection for the soybean event GTS- 40 - 3 - 2 real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) system described by Terry et al. (J AOAC Int 85 (4) : 938 ¿ 944, 2002) were shown to be similar for in house produced homozygous genomic DNA from leaf tissue of soybean event GTS- 40 - 3 - 2 and for plasmid pJANUS¿- 02 - 001 DNA backgrounds. The performance of this real-time Q-PCR system using both types of DNA templates as calibrator standards in quantitative DNA analysis was further assessed in an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trial.</b> Statistical analysis and fuzzy-logic-based interpretation were performed on critical method parameters (as defined by the European Network of GMO Laboratories and the Community Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed guidelines) and demonstrated that the plasmid pJANUS¿- 02 - 001 DNA represents a valuable alternative to genomic DNA as a calibrator for the quantification of soybean event GTS- 40 - 3 - 2 in food and feed products.

40|$|An <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trial</b> for {{determination}} of zearalenone (ZON) in baby food and animal feed was conducted. The study involved 39 participants in 16 European Union member states, {{as well as}} Turkey, Uruguay, and China, representing a cross-section of industry, and official food control and research institutes. The method is based on immunoaffinity column cleanup followed by high-performance liquid chromatography using fluorimetry (HPLC-Fl). The test portion of the sample is extracted with methanol¿water (75 + 25, v/v). The sample extract is filtered, diluted, and passed over an immunoaffinity column. ZON is eluted with methanol. The separation and {{determination of}} ZON is performed by reversed-phase HPLC-Fl with an excitation wavelength of 274 nm and an emission wavelength of 446 nm. Test portions of the samples were spiked at levels of 20 and 30 µg/kg ZON in baby food and at levels of 100 and 150 µg/kg ZON in animal feed. Mean recoveries from each participant ranged from 78 to 119 % with an average value of 92 % for baby food and from 51 to 122 % with an average value of 74 % for animal feed. Based on results for spiked samples (blind duplicates at 2 levels), as well as naturally contaminated samples (blind duplicates at 3 levels), the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) in baby food ranged from 2. 8 to 9. 0 %. For animal feed, this value ranged from 5. 7 to 9. 5 %. The relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) in baby food ranged from 8. 2 to 13. 3 %, and for animal feed this value ranged from 15. 5 to 21. 4 %. The Horwitz ratio (HorRat) in baby food ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 4, and for animal feed this value ranged from 0. 6 to 0. 9.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of genotoxic substances in river {{water is a}} serious problem because of their risk for both human and ecosystem health. Although numerous test methods for the genotoxicological testing of water samples are described in the literature from Germany and abroad, no sound experience has been gained as to whether the test systems hitherto used are sufficiently sensitive and suited for routine use. Therefore, a research project was designed to develop a test strategy for the detection and evaluation of genotoxic effects in surface water aquatic organisms. Indicator tests were evaluated with respect to their predictive power, sensitivity an practicability in order to determine whether they are suitable for inclusion in a battery of tests. The bioassays utilized in this study include the umu-test, alkaline filter elution (mussels, green algae), the DNA unwinding test (fish larvae, cray fish, mussels, fish cell lines), the comet assay (protozoans, green algae, mussels, primary fish hepatocytes, fish and mammalian cell lines) and the UDS-test (primary fish hepatocytes). The Ames Salmonella assay, a direct genotoxicity assay and a well-known base test in chemicals assessment, was included in the study programme for comparison. (orig.) assays. The test- and substance-specific sensitivity thresholds were determined. In a simplified <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trial</b> 4 non-spiked and genotoxin-spiked surface water samples from the river Weisse Elster (doted genotoxin: a Gentox mixture based on 4 -NQO) were tested with the assays with the result that reproducible dose-effect relationships have been shown. In a second phase of the project the validated methods were applied to nonconcentrated samples of surface water taken on a monthly basis from the river Rhine, the Wahnbach dam, the rivers Elbe and Mulde over a period of 12 months {{as well as from the}} river Wupper and a gasworks site. This allowed temporal and spatial variations to be identified over a relatively long period of time. Chemical profile analyses were carried out on all samples to identify genotoxic contaminants, but the chemical data generated did not reflect the genotoxic effects found by the biological methods. The data obtained showed the comet assay, the umu-test and the Ames-test to be particularly sensitive and to detect genotoxic effects in complex mixtures in a low dose range. They seem to be suitable for routine testing and should therefore be used in the first stage of a graduated testing battery for detectionof gentoxicity in surfaceSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 00 B 946 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of project N 170 l, {{commissioned}} by MAFF from October 1990 until March 1992. The principle aims of the project, {{at a time when}} statutory changes involving strict labelling rules were anticipated, were to consolidate the thermoluminescence technique already developed at SURRC and to investigate it's extension to fruits and vegetables. The TL procedures for mineral separation were further developed by the incorporation of pre-concentration steps. These steps were introduced in order to improve the the sensitivity of the TL signal, particularly, where the separation technique resulted in low mineral yield for commercially clean samples. This has resulted in an order of magnitude increase in the absolute, TL, signal levels and provides a means of obtaining larger quantities of minerals for any further quantification, thus reducing the ambiguity of interpretation of data. An EC <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>trial</b> was instigated, using the full mineral separation method with reirradiation on a set of calibrated reference materials and paired (irradiated and unirradiated) samples of 12 commercial grade herbs and spices. Despite the diversity of experience and equipment employed, results from all laboratories showed {{that it was possible to}} determine which samples were irradiated. This demonstrated the strength of the separation method that its implementation could be successfully achieved in other laboratories. The procedure was then formally recognised and published, by MAFF, for detection of irradiated food for enforcement of UK legislation. As the mineral debris responsible for TL in herbs and spices occurs ubiquitously on all foodstuffs, which have been exposed to wind and soil, investigating the application of TL to fruits and vegetables was a natural extension of the previous work. An extensive survey was conducted of TL signals from fruits and vegetables, including exotic varieties. Minerals were separated from duplicated pairs of irradiated and unirradiated samples of 22 fruits and 20 vegetables. TL results demonstrated unambiguous discrimination between irradiated and unirradiated vegetables provided that concordance diagrams were used. For soft fruits in particular water based separation produced more variable results. However, subsequent analyses using a full density separation with HCI wash were more successful. It was recognised that whereas herbs and spices are largely protected from exposure to light during production and distribution, this is unlikely to be the case for fruits and vegtables. Since light exposure is known to reduce TL signal intensity, a set of illumination experiments was conducted to investigate the implications of optical bleaching for identification. Light boxes were constructed and characterised to simulated optical bleaching under controlled conditions. Two series of experiments were conducted with irradiated and control mangos. In the first experiment the effects of exposure to two different light sources at a level of 1 J cm- 2 were investigated using 40 mangos. In the second experiment the influence of duration of exposure from 1 - 128 J cm- 2 was examined for artificial daylight illumination of a further 96 mangos. The results of these studies show that although the TL signal is reduced as a result of exposure to daylight, there exists a residual unbleachable component comprising upto 40 - 50...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus anthracis, the causative {{agent of}} anthrax, is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen that is relatively common {{throughout the world}} and may cause life threatening diseases in animals and humans. There are many PCR-based assays in use {{for the detection of}} B. anthracis. While most of the developed assays rely on unique markers present on virulence plasmids pXO 1 and pXO 2, relatively few assays incorporate chromosomal DNA markers due to the close relatedness of B. anthracis to the B. cereus group strains. For the detection of chromosomal DNA, different genes have been used, such as BA 813, rpoB, gyrA, plcR, S-layer, and prophage-lambda. Following a review of the literature, an in silico analysis of all signature sequences reported for identification of B. anthracis was conducted. Published primer and probe sequences were compared for specificity against 134 available Bacillus spp. genomes. Although many of the chromosomal targets evaluated are claimed to be specific to B. anthracis, cross-reactions with closely related B. cereus and B. thuringiensis strains were often observed. Of the 35 investigated PCR assays, only 4 were 100 % specific for the B. anthracis chromosome. An <b>interlaboratory</b> ring <b>trial</b> among five European laboratories was then performed to evaluate six assays, including the WHO recommended procedures, using a collection of 90 Bacillus strains.
