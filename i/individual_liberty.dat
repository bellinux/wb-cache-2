5|$|Rowan {{identified}} with the Democratic-Republican Party and espoused the Jeffersonian principles of limited government and <b>individual</b> <b>liberty.</b> He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated the supremacy of the legislative branch over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the direct election of these officers instead.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights, {{embodied}} in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, {{and prevent the}} State from encroaching on <b>individual</b> <b>liberty</b> while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society. Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution– right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and right to constitutional remedies. However, the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978.|$|E

5|$|No one {{government}} in the Commonwealth exercises power over the others, {{as is the case}} in a political union. Rather, the Commonwealth is an international organisation in which countries with diverse social, political, and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status, and cooperate within a framework of common values and goals, as outlined in the Singapore Declaration issued in 1971. Such common values and goals include the promotion of democracy, human rights, good governance, the rule of law, <b>individual</b> <b>liberty,</b> egalitarianism, free trade, multilateralism, and world peace, which are promoted through multilateral projects and meetings, such as the Commonwealth Games, held once every four years.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{developed}} by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed <b>individual</b> <b>liberty,</b> property rights, freedom of religion and the press, and equality before the law. Because of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law, it was praised by liberals {{around the world and}} promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom {{is covered}} in Articles 19-22, with the view of guaranteeing {{individual}} rights that were considered vital by {{the framers of the}} Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on <b>individual</b> <b>liberty</b> under specified conditions. Article 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted, and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences, and defamation. The State is also empowered, {{in the interests of the}} general public to nationalise any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.|$|E

25|$|Nationalists– {{most of them}} war veterans– {{organized}} in every state and convinced Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The delegates from every state wrote a new Constitution that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of <b>individual</b> <b>liberty</b> and of constraining the power of government through a system of separation of powers.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} {{is a set}} {{of ideas}} that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural rights (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers <b>individual</b> <b>liberty</b> {{to be the most important}} goal, because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.|$|E
25|$|Anarcho-capitalists, voluntaryists {{and other}} right-anarchists oppose {{institutional}} democracy as they consider it {{in conflict with}} widely held moral values and ethical principles and their conception of individual rights. The a priori Rothbardian argument {{is that the state}} is a coercive institution which necessarily violates the non-aggression principle (NAP). Some right-anarchists also criticise democracy on a posteriori consequentialist grounds, in terms of inefficiency or disability in bringing about maximisation of <b>individual</b> <b>liberty.</b> They maintain the people who participate in democratic institutions are foremost driven by economic self-interest.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{development of}} John Rawls and Raymond Aron highlights a liberalism that acknowledges as its starting point the individual being free and isolated, which, {{because of the}} influence of internal and external constraints on <b>individual</b> <b>liberties,</b> encourages the construction of a cohesive political community. With such a perspective challenges the modern version of liberty as an absence of coercion and, at the same time, highlights the validity of the discussion about the limits of liberty in contemporary societies. This phenomenon can be described as the transition from liberalism to social democracy, or as revision of the negative conception of <b>individual</b> <b>liberties...</b>|$|R
