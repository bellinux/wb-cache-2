5|$|In late December 2006, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that the developer was soliciting opinions on a further revision from community leaders. Several weeks following that report the Chicago Tribune held {{an exclusive interview with}} architect Santiago Calatrava and lead developer Garrett Kelleher. During the interview, Calatrava <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> design ideas restoring the rotating design of the building and showcasing his vision for the Chicago Spire's lobby. On March 26, 2007, further revisions were shown during a public presentation by Shelbourne Development showcasing the most recent design.|$|E
5|$|One more legend narrated {{is about}} the goddess painted on a thangka in the monastery which is of Palden Lhamo. This female deity is {{compared}} to the Hindu Goddess Kali. Like Kali, Palden Lhamo's thangka is drawn in black colour, with flaming eyes, dressed in skirt made of tiger skin, and a garland of skulls around her neck. A moon disc adorns her hair, {{similar to the one}} seen on Shiva. She is also associated with Goddess Saraswati and Ma Tara. Legend also states that in the past she had lived in Sri Lanka as the consort of a demon king who practiced human sacrifice. As she was not supportive of this practice she fled from the kingdom. As she was running away, the king shot her shot with an arrow, which struck the backside of the mule that she was riding. When she <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> the arrow, it left a gaping hole in the mule's back, and through this gap Palden Lhamo could watch the teachings of Lord Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E

5|$|In {{the typical}} CG approach, {{the duties of}} 2D and 3D artists are distinct. The 2D artists think up and sketch out the characters' appearances; the 3D artists create the models based on these concept sketches. For Karas, these artists worked {{together}} in these areas to create the imagery seen in the show. To encourage this and establish consistency between images based on 2D and 3D processes, the 2D drawings incorporate styles typically found in 3D models. Animators also touched up or enhanced by hand, sequences involving the models. Eko's karas form was mainly a 3D model but his skirt was hand drawn. During later stages of editing, the team spaced hand drawn frames among 3D-rendered frames to enhance the fusion of styles. The production did not use motion capture techniques. Animators <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> action scenes based on their feelings, inspirations, and observations. 3D and 2D animation and special effects director, Takashi Hashimoto explained companies typically reduce their animators' workload by using CG for long shots and drawing only close-ups by hand. The team working on Karas, however, drew silhouettes for long shots and created complicated CG for close-ups. The 3D animators used 3D texture software, BodyPaint 3D, to refine textures for the mikura and karas models, creating seamless details on them.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after the}} Disney Channel {{accepted}} the show, Povenmire and Marsh {{turned their attention}} to the company's overseas executives.

25|$|In the Argonautica (third century BC), Jason {{had been}} warned by Chiron that Orpheus would be {{necessary}} in his journey. When Orpheus heard their voices, he <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> his lyre and played his music more beautifully than they, drowning out their voices. One of the crew, however, the sharp-eared hero Butes, heard the song and leapt into the sea, but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E
25|$|Toward the {{beginning}} of 879, Sulayman ibn Jami' {{decided to make a}} new advance and set out with his elite commanders and troops. He first encountered Takin al-Bukhari at al-Shadidiyyah on the Nahr Barduda, and despite suffering substantial losses he defeated him and seized his barges. News of this engagement caused Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had been appointed as governor of the region, to advance to al-Shadidiyyah himself. The resulting battle went on inconclusively for two days, but on the third day Sulayman <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> Ibn Laythawayh's by ordering his men to fall back. The Zanj then turned around and defeated the government army; Ibn Laythawayh was thrown into the Nahr Barduda and only narrowly escaped being drowned.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{charge of}} the Congress, Gandhi also reached out to support the Khilafat struggle, helping to bridge Hindu-Muslim {{political}} divides. Azad and the Ali brothers - Maulana Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali - warmly welcomed Congress support and began working together on a programme of non-co-operation by asking all Indians to boycott British-run schools, colleges, courts, public services, the civil service, police and military. Non-violence and Hindu-Muslim unity were universally emphasised, while the boycott of foreign goods, especially clothes were organised. Azad joined the Congress and was also {{elected president of the}} All India Khilafat Committee. Although Azad and other leaders were soon arrested, the movement <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> millions of people in peaceful processions, strikes and protests.|$|E
25|$|The draw {{was staged}} in Mexico City, Mexico on 10 January 1970 in the Maria Isabel Hotel, {{which served as}} FIFA's {{headquarters}} during the competition. The teams were drawn into the four groups, which had their locations defined in advance: Group 1 being staged in Mexico City, Group 2 in Puebla and Toluca, Group 3 in Guadalajara and Group 4 in León. It was predetermined that the hosts Mexico would be in Group 1 and so based in the capital city, and that England as holders would be based in Guadalajara, the tournament's second largest stadium. The 10-year-old daughter of Guillermo Cañedo, President of the Mexican Football Federation and the Local Organising Committee, <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> the teams from four silver cups.|$|E

Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to catch his breath and review what was happening on his left.|$|E

25|$|The magistrates {{were people}} who {{occupied}} a public post and formed {{the administration of the}} Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous public control. The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> they obtained the post or not. This was a way of eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were strategos, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the strategoi and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.|$|E
25|$|Starting for the Nationals {{to begin}} a three-game series on the road against the Phillies on September 25, Cole notched his first career hit, a single up the middle off Phillies ace Aaron Nola. Cole outdueled Nola to earn the win in the 3−1 contest. The next day, the Nationals {{activated}} star right fielder Bryce Harper from the disabled list after he missed {{more than a month}} with a hyperextended right knee and strained calf. The Nationals lost the September 26 and September 27 games to the Phillies before heading back to Washington, D.C., for a four-game homestand to end the regular season against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Closer Sean Doolittle suffered his first blown save as a National since being acquired in trade from the Oakland Athletics in July, giving up a single to Andrew McCutchen and then a home run to Josh Bell on his first two pitches of the ninth inning on September 28. However, the Nationals rallied {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning after the Pirates had tied it, with Rendon leading off with a single that was consecutively followed by singles from Murphy and then De Aza, whose sharp line drive down the right field line brought home Rendon to complete a 5−4 walkoff victory. Strasburg made his final start of the regular season on September 29, leading the Nationals to a 6−1 win with 7⅔ shutout innings of no-hit ball to earn his 15th win of the year, joining Scherzer and Gio González among Nationals pitchers with that many. Strasburg also passed the 200-strikeout mark, making him and Scherzer the only pair of pitchers in team history with at least 200 strikeouts in a season. Zimmerman turned in one of the best offensive performances of his career, notching four extra-base hits for the first time in a game as he doubled twice and homered twice. On September 30, the Nationals announced Kelley had been diagnosed with bone chips in his right elbow and placed him on the 60-day disabled list. Infielder Stephen <b>Drew,</b> <b>out</b> since late July, was activated from the 60-day disabled list. In the last game of the month on September 30, Scherzer had to leave his start after 3⅓ innings with what the team later announced was a hamstring cramp. Cole came on in long relief and fired 3⅔ hitless innings, preserving Scherzer's one-hitter, before Romero came on for the eighth inning and worked around a walk. Kintzler, inserted to vie for his 30th career save, could not hold the 1−0 lead in the top of the ninth inning and gave up four runs on four hits to take the loss.|$|E

500|$|It {{was later}} commented on by William Butler Yeats, who noted that [...] " [...] {{interests}} a critical audience {{today by the}} grotesque tragedy of Danny Deever". T. S.

500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|As {{leader of}} the Alberta Liberals, Boyle corresponded {{extensively}} with Liberal Party of Canada leader (and Prime Minister of Canada) William Lyon Mackenzie King; according to Foster, Boyle's letters to King were [...] "a mixture of useless information and pleas to be rescued by an appointment to the bench." [...] It is possible {{that one of his}} letters had some impact on history, however: in 1924, while Greenfield was attempting to negotiate control of Alberta's natural resources from King's federal government, Boyle sent King a letter warning him that the UFA was doomed in the next election unless [...] "something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." [...] King <b>drew</b> <b>out</b> negotiations until Greenfield returned to Alberta empty-handed; soon after, Greenfield was forced from office by his own backbenchers, and replaced by Brownlee.|$|E
