40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the legal regime of water management {{facilities in the}} light of Serbian, foreign and <b>European</b> <b>law.</b> Different <b>divisions</b> of water management facilities are carried out (to public and private ones, natural and artificial ones, etc.), with determination of their legal relevance. Account is taken of the issue of protection from harmful effects of waters to such facilities, as well. The paper points also to rules on the water management facilities, from acts of planning, to individual administrative acts and measures for maintenance of required qualitative and quantitative condition of waters, depending on their purpose (general use or special, commercial use o waters). Albeit special rules on water management facilities exist, due to the natural interlocking between all the components of the environment (water, air and soil), a comprehensive approach is required. A reference is made to other basic principles of protection of water management facilities as well, such as the principle of prevention, principle of sustainable development and the principle "polluter pays". The last one represents the achievement of contemporary law, which deviates from the idea accepted {{in the second half of}} 20 th century that supported the socialization of risk from harmful effects of waters...|$|R

40|$|When {{discussing}} {{the influence of}} Community law on national law the attention often focuses on (removing) conflicts of special national provisions with <b>European</b> <b>law</b> in concrete situations. In this article, however, a different, proactive facilitating approach is chosen, focusing on general administrative law especially as a facilitating instrument for the effective implementation of <b>European</b> <b>law</b> in a broad sense: the ‘PF-method’. The central question is whether by means of general provisions of administrative law, in a proactive way, even without <b>European</b> <b>law</b> forcing to this, the legal implementation, application and enforcement of <b>European</b> <b>law</b> may be simplifie...|$|R
50|$|The {{primacy of}} <b>European</b> Union <b>law</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as supremacy) is an EU law principle that when there is conflict between <b>European</b> <b>law</b> and the law of Member States, <b>European</b> <b>law</b> prevails; the norms of national law have to be set aside. This principle {{was developed by the}} European Court of Justice, and, as interpreted by that court, it means that any norms of <b>European</b> <b>law</b> always take precedence over any norms of national law, including the constitutions of member states. Although national courts generally accept the principle in practice, most of them disagree with this extreme interpretation and reserve the right, in principle, to review the constitutionality of <b>European</b> <b>law</b> under national constitutional law.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} elaborates on {{the existence}} of national judicial autonomy in <b>European</b> <b>law.</b> In the context of this paper, the main example used to demonstrate this phenomenon will be ‘national <b>European</b> <b>law</b> precedents’. National <b>European</b> <b>law</b> precedents are in fact a demonstration of a broader notion of national judicial autonomy. Questions that I particularly propose to address are the following: What is a ‘national <b>European</b> <b>law</b> precedent’? What sort of precedents can we think of in the context of Dutch European case-law? What consequences may follow from the existence of national <b>European</b> <b>law</b> precedents? What is the significance of these precedents? Suppose, a need for correction mechanisms exists, which practical solutions are the most obvious? In this paper I hope to shed some further light on these questions...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{interpretation}} of <b>European</b> <b>law.</b> It is based on the classical methodology of law interpretation in continental Europe, but it also reflects the particularities and recent approaches, which are used in <b>European</b> <b>law</b> as in independent and particular legal system. So it is essential to emphasize the autonomous conception of <b>European</b> <b>law,</b> which finally means its own methodology which is different from national attitudes. By practice of European bodies and mainly by judgments of Court of Justice of European Union was established specific set of rules which corresponds to peculiarities of European Union as an integrative society. The Court of Justice formulated in its decision two basic principles for the application of the <b>European</b> <b>law</b> in the Member States: the principle of direct effect of the <b>European</b> <b>law</b> in the Member States and the principle of the primacy of the <b>European</b> <b>law</b> rules in the national legal rules of the Member States. There should be further assigned to these two basic principles the principle of indirect effect of directives (uniform interpretation) and the principle of State liability for damage caused to an individual by breach of the <b>European</b> <b>law.</b> The application of principles of direct effect and primacy of the <b>European</b> <b>law</b> rules is closely related to the preliminary ruling procedure (prejudicial proceedings). The judge-made law can be used only by the Court of Justice, neither the administrative bodies of EU nor the national bodies have this capacity...|$|R

In March 2010, the Association for a <b>European</b> <b>Law</b> Institute (ELIA) was founded, which served to initiate and coordinate a Europe-wide debate. By 2011, the ELIA had around 250 members, academics from more than 100 <b>European</b> <b>law</b> faculties as well as judges, many of them from Member States' supreme courts, and legal professionals.|$|R
