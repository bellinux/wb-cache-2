The original definition of a tempered representation, which has certain technical advantages, is that its Harish-Chandra character should be a [...] "tempered distribution" [...] (see the section about this below). It follows from Harish-Chandra's results that it is equivalent to the more <b>elementary</b> <b>definition</b> given above. Tempered representations also seem to play a fundamental role in the theory of automorphic forms. This connection was probably first realized by Satake (in the context of the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture) and Robert Langlands and served as a motivation for Langlands to develop his classification scheme for irreducible admissible representations of real and p-adic reductive algebraic groups in terms of the tempered representations of smaller groups. The precise conjectures identifying the place of tempered representations in the automorphic spectrum were formulated later by James Arthur and constitute one of the most actively developing parts of the modern theory of automorphic forms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{functional}} framework for studying agent-based dynamical models of exchange.

These can be used to deduce model properties and to setup "crucial" numerical experiments for validating model implementations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present paper is twofold: Firstly, show that it is {{possible}} to rewrite graphs in a way equivalent to, and in fact slightly more powerful than that of Ehrig, Pfender and Schneider (1973), which has, since then, been developed mainly by the Berlin school. Our method consists in using a single push-out of partial morphisms and is described in Section 3. Section 1 is devoted to the <b>elementary</b> <b>definitions</b> concerning graphs and related terms. Section 2 contains the set-theoretic prerequisites for the sequel but the proofs have been moved into an appendix, for easier reading. Secondly, we indicate in Section 4 why this method is not really fit for rewriting graphs that represent collapsed terms (i. e., sharing common subterms) and we introduce pushouts of total functions, which are not morphisms everywhere on their domain. This method is connected to the classical rewriting of the corresponding terms. The adequacy of these new rewriting rules is then tested to prove a local confluence criterion a la Knuth-Bendix (1970) in Section 5, the proof of which turns out to be very short...|$|R
