5|$|The {{following}} day, a {{panel is}} {{held for the}} office so that audience members can ask them questions. Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} chooses the Truth door, Tapp pursues a mysterious cloaked figure who he {{believes}} to be Jigsaw. After catching and brutally beating the figure, Tapp realizes {{that it is}} actually Melissa Sing, a victim whom Tapp had saved earlier in the game. A tape found on Melissa explains that Jigsaw <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in charge of keeping Tapp alive and making sure he followed the rules of Jigsaw's game after Tapp rescued her. Jigsaw had kidnapped her son and had Pighead sew her mouth shut to avoid her spoiling Tapp's test. Attempting {{to run away from}} Tapp, Melissa desperately charges through a nearby door rigged with a shotgun, which kills her {{in the same way as}} her late husband, Steven Sing. Tapp suffers a mental breakdown as a result of her death and is placed in a functional asylum where he still believes he is playing Jigsaw's games.|$|E

5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist {{opinions}} <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E
5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E

25|$|Photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo {{understood}} that Kahlo {{did not have}} much longer to live, and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galería Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953. Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on bed rest. As a solution, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery. To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to the bed, where she stayed {{for the duration of the}} party. The exhibition was not only a notable cultural event in Mexico, but also received attention in mainstream press around the world. The same year, five of her paintings were also included in Tate gallery's exhibition on Mexican art in London.|$|E

Nevertheless, she [...] "wanted to live a life, and have purpose and things to write about" [...] due to her passion for writing music.

500|$|At the university, Rodham gave {{classes in}} {{criminal}} law, {{where she was}} considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades. She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding. In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> [...] "through hell" [...] during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a [...] "terrible case". During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center. Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else's.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Beyoncé had {{productive}} studio sessions {{while making}} her debut album, Dangerously in Love, recording up to forty-five songs. After {{the release of}} Dangerously in Love in 2003, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the leftover tracks. However, on January 7,2004, a spokesperson for her record label, Columbia, announced that Beyoncé <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> plans on hold in order {{to concentrate on the}} recording of Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child, and to sing the US national anthem at the Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, which was a childhood dream of hers. In late 2005, Beyoncé decided to postpone the recording of her second album because she had landed a lead role in Dreamgirls, a film adaptation of the 1981 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical of the same name. As she wanted to focus on one project at a time, Beyoncé decided to wait until the movie was completed before returning to the recording studio. Beyoncé later told Billboard magazine: [...] "I'm not going to write for the album until I finish doing the movie." ...|$|E

She told the Journal Sentinel that her sister had [...] "encouraged" [...] her to sign up as a supporter with “Citizens for McCain,” {{an arm of the}} campaign targeting Democrats and independents. Bartoshevich added that it was the McCain campaign, not she herself, who then notified a reporter. In a later statement to Wisconsin Democratic Party leaders, however, Bartoshevich claimed that it was in fact her sister, who was working for Citizens for McCain, who <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> name onto the McCain campaign website.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{had told}} Lady Avon, {{following}} her honeymoon in 1952, {{that he wanted}} to give up the premiership. However, it was not until 6 April 1955 that Eden succeeded him as Prime Minister, shortly afterward winning a general election in which the Conservative Party polled the largest percentage of the popular vote recorded by a party between 1945 and the present day. Colville noted that, at a dinner, attended by the Queen, to mark Churchill's retirement, the Duchess of Westminster <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> foot through Lady Avon's train, causing the monarch's consort, The Duke of Edinburgh, to remark, [...] "that's torn it, in more than one sense".|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{wound up}} the debate for the government, {{defending}} {{the conduct of}} the Norwegian campaign with some robustness. [...] He explained that even the successful use of the battleship HMS Warspite at Narvik <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> at risk from many hazards; had any come to pass, the operation, now hailed as an example of what should have been done elsewhere, would have been condemned as foolhardy. [...] "It is easy when you have no responsibility. If you dare, and forfeit is exacted, it is murder of our sailors; and if you are prudent, you are craven, cowardly, inept and timid". If nothing similarly bold had been done at Trondheim, it was not because it was thought too dangerous; but because it had been thought unnecessary: military advice had been against an opposed landing and instead predicted rapid success from the steps actually taken.|$|E

2500|$|Cuncar of Angus was Mormaer of Angus {{somewhere in}} the mid or later 10th century, which makes it quite {{possible}} {{that he was the}} successor of Dubacan. One divergent source calls him thanus (i.e. toísech), but otherwise he is comes (i.e. Mormaer). The tradition called by Anderson the Chronicle of the Kings of Scotland records in several manuscripts that Cuncar's daughter Lady Finella was {{responsible for the death of}} king Cináed II, because the aforementioned King of Scots <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> son to death. Otherwise, Cuncar is obscure. Even the name [...] "Cuncar" [...] is obscure, and may not be authentic, representing either the Gaelic name Conchobar or the Brythonic name Cincar. John of Fordun calls him Cruchne, which is clearly equivalent to Cruithne, as in Fordun's period, owing to French influence, cs often replace ts. Cruithne was the Gaelic word for a Pict, but why Fordun gives Cuncar this name is even more obscure than Cuncar himself.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1970s Dusty Springfield was a major star, though her record sales were declining. Her {{intimate}} companion, Norma Tanega, had returned to the US after their relationship had become stressful, and Springfield was spending more time in the US herself. In January 1970 her second and final album on Atlantic Records, A Brand New Me (re-titled as From Dusty... With Love in the UK), was released, it featured tracks written and produced by Gamble and Huff. The album and related singles only sold moderately, and Springfield was unhappy with both her management and record company. She sang back up vocals with her friend Madeline Bell on two tracks on Elton John's 1971 hit album, Tumbleweed Connection. She recorded some songs with producer Jeff Barry in early 1971, which were intended for an album to be released by Atlantic Records. However, her new manager Alan Bernard negotiated her out of the Atlantic contract; some of the tracks were used on the UK-only album, See All Her Faces (November 1972), and the 1999 release, Dusty in Memphis-Deluxe Edition. In 1972, Springfield signed a contract with ABC Dunhill Records and Cameo was issued in February 1973 to respectable reviews, though poor sales. In 1973, Springfield recorded the theme song for the TV series, The Six Million Dollar Man, which was used for two of its film-length episodes: [...] "Wine, Women & War" [...] and [...] "The Solid Gold Kidnapping". Her second ABC Dunhill album was given the working title Elements and was then scheduled for release in late 1974 as Longing. However, the recording sessions were abandoned, although part of the material, including tentative and incomplete vocals, was issued on the 2001 posthumous compilation Beautiful Soul. By 1974 Springfield <b>had</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> solo musical career on hold to live as a recluse in the US and avoid scrutiny by UK tabloids. In the 1960s and early 1970s gay or bisexual performers [...] "knew that being 'out' would lead to prurient media attention, loss of record contracts... the tabloids became obsessively interested in the contents of celebrity closets". In the mid-1970s she sang background vocals on Elton John's album Caribou (June 1974), including his single [...] "The Bitch Is Back"; and on Anne Murray's album Together (November 1975).|$|E
