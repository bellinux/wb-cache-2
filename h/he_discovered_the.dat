5|$|Between 1842 and 1845 while Griswold was {{collecting}} {{material for}} Prose Writers of America <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> identity of Horace Binney Wallace, {{who had been}} writing in various literary magazines at the time (including Burton's) under the pen name William Landor. Wallace declined {{to be included in}} the anthology but the two became friends, exchanging many letters over the years. Wallace eventually ghostwrote Griswold's Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire (1847).|$|E
5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps {{to prevent it from}} reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine also plays a role in the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{linked the}} nature of prime {{distribution}} with ideas in analysis. He proved that {{the sum of the}} reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> connection between the Riemann zeta function and the prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.|$|E

5|$|Following his resignation, Overton had {{no contact}} with the military. This {{continued}} for several decades until Overton reconnected with fellow West Point graduate Lieutenant General Charles G. Cleveland, and <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> Air Force had established Air Force Review Boards Agency to review incidents and determine if individuals had been unfairly denied medals. In the meantime, Overton became a successful businessman, owning and operating several companies.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a Dutch {{administrator}} of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> large statue of Buddha in the main stupa. In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} was {{noted in the}} 18th century by Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, a self-taught {{botanist}} and clergyman. Muhlenberg, who named more than 150North American plant species, was conducting {{a survey of the}} flora of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, when <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> small turtle. In 1801, Johann David Schoepff named Muhlenberg's discovery as Testudo muhlenbergii in Muhlenberg's honor.|$|E

5|$|Tod also {{submitted}} archæological {{papers to}} the Royal Asiatic Society's Transactions series. He {{was interested in}} numismatics as well, and <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> first specimens of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins from the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, which were described in his books. These ancient kingdoms had been largely forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod's findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins {{have been found in}} large quantities since his death.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Adelaide, South Australia, Oliphant {{graduated}} from the University of Adelaide in 1922. He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 {{on the strength of}} the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons). He also discovered that when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|Data and Picard {{discover}} a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic holodeck {{set up to}} recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection. Filmed in black and white with a running time of three-and-a-half minutes, Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon. The short film was made {{with the support of the}} University of Southern California, where Glut was a student at the time. The plot centered on a man (presumably McKenna) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several people before falling to his death off a cliff. The film also starred John Schuyler as the film's hero and Burns' wife Kathy.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had the master tapes in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> Denver City Council possessed the tapes among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing the tapes and intended to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of the tapes. Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return the tapes to Wurpel and U2.|$|E

5|$|In early 1861 after Texas {{voted to}} secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a new military company. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{discovery}} of enzymes {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of biochemistry. The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century. One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism. <b>He</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> urea cycle and later, working with Hans Kornberg, the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius married Vipsania Agrippina, the {{daughter}} of Augustus’s close friend and greatest general, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. He {{was appointed to the}} position of praetor, and sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in Gallia Narbonensis and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the Alps and within Transalpine Gaul, conquering Raetia. In 15BC <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> sources of the Danube, and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course. Returning to Rome in 13BC, Tiberius was appointed as consul, and around this same time his son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1955 cricket season, Headley {{was invited}} to become a {{national}} coach, a post created by the Jamaican government, which involved working mainly with young people. Headley and his second son travelled back to Jamaica, {{while the rest of}} the family remained in England. Headley had a heavy workload, particularly in rural areas; together with his assistant Dickie Fuller his role involved encouraging school children to watch and play cricket, and trying to improve standards and facilities throughout the country. Headley became involved in the selection of teams, taking some of them overseas. At this time, <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> future West Indian Test player Roy Gilchrist and future Jamaican cricketer Henry Sewell. However, critics in the 1960s complained that there were not enough Jamaicans in the Test side and blamed Headley and Fuller, although the government remained supportive of their performance. In 1961, Headley coached for six months in Nigeria and earned praise from the Nigerian Cricket Association. His official coaching role in Jamaica ended after a new government withdrew funding for coaching in 1962.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, <b>he</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
