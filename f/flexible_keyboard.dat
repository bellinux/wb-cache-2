40|$|In this paper, {{the use of}} a battery-powered, {{handheld}} computer system (HHC) for the capture of drug and events (D&E) during anesthesia and surgery is described. The advantages of the HHC system are small size, non-volatile memory, <b>flexible</b> <b>keyboard</b> configuration-every key can be a special function key labeled with custom overlays, fast entry of D&E with accurate time of day and provision of a pulse signal to external trend recorders logging each real-time entry. Disadvantages are limited processing speed that can inhibit complex operations such as long searches for a particular drug entry and some training is required to become a proficient user...|$|E
40|$|Recently, many {{full-sized}} keyboards {{have been}} designed to fold in various ways in an attempt to make them more transportable. The flexible membrane keyboard, one type of full sized keyboard, is unique because it is made from silicon rubber, thus it is fully flexible and water resistant. Although a number of <b>flexible</b> <b>keyboard</b> characteristics are the same as standard keyboards (i. e. key size, shape and spacing), key-switch and key clicking mechanisms are inherently different. Since {{there is little or no}} existing research on flexible keyboards, there is a current need for data to facilitate design of such keyboards for use. Typing performance and perceived usability of several flexible keyboards that differed in terms of material hardness (hard, medium, or soft) and key contact point shape (circular or square) were studied. The results supported the hypothesis that both typing performance and usability of the flexible membrane keyboard were affected by material hardness and contact point shape. Square shaped contact points led to increased typing speed and decreased error rates, and medium or soft hardness led to increased typing speed. The best <b>flexible</b> <b>keyboard</b> (perceived by participants) in general received neutral usability ratings. However, ratings for mobility and design were much higher than neutral. Overall, subjective and objective measures of performance and usability indicated that flexible keyboards that are made of silicon of a soft or medium hardness and with a square shaped contact points are preferred...|$|E
25|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>keyboards</b> are a {{junction}} between normal {{type and}} laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows {{the user to}} fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of <b>flexible</b> <b>keyboards</b> in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water and dust proof, a very pleasant feature especially in hospitals where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing. For connection with the computer the keyboards use a USB cable, and operating system support reaches {{as far back as}} Windows 2000.|$|R

The new modules included: ...|$|R
50|$|The older, {{original}} Surface and Surface 2, {{with their}} ARM-based processors and Windows RT operating system, are pitched against the iPad and other tablets. The Surface Pro 3 (like the preceding Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2), with its Intel CPU and Windows 8 OS, is a full-fledged PC that competes against Ultrabooks (particularly those convertible laptops with touchscreens for a tablet functionality, <b>flexible</b> hinges, detachable <b>keyboards,</b> or sliders) and other high-end subnotebooks (that don't compromise performance or battery life) {{such as the}} MacBook Air.|$|R
5000|$|Input methods allow {{words to}} be {{composed}} {{in a more}} <b>flexible</b> order than <b>keyboard</b> layouts allow. For example, to enter the word [...] "" [...] using the TCVN 6064:1995 keyboard layout, one must type , in that order. By contrast, most IMEs permit the user to insert diacritics {{at the end of}} the word: [...] in Telex, [...] in VNI, or [...] in VIQR. Some IMEs even allow diacritics to be entered before their base letters. Depending on an IME's implementation, it may also be possible to edit an existing word's diacritics without retyping the word.|$|R
40|$|Other {{variations}} of keyboards include {{those found in}} touch screens, which are becoming more popular with tablet computing. Touch screen keyboards are considered the natural evolution of “on-screen ” keyboards, in which {{an image of the}} keyboard appears on the screen and keys are selected by clicking the mouse. Foldable or flexible key-boards are made of plastic or silicone and are great for traveling. They can be attached to computers and other devices such as cellular telephones. <b>Flexible</b> <b>keyboards</b> are also ideal for hospitals and labo-ratories because they can be washed and disinfected, and the absence of crevices between keys makes them “cleaner. ” Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper reported that computer keyboards have more than 150 times the acceptable number of germs and are 5 times dirtier than a toilet (a fact to keep in mind when you are eating your sandwich while typing or surfing the Web). In a study performed here at the Univer-sity of North Carolina, computer keyboards housed in the Burn Unit were found to be uniformly infected with coag-ulase-negative Staphylococcus organisms, a common source of hospital-acquired sepsis. 6 Diphtheroids were present on 80 % of those keyboards, and are particularly dangerous for immunosuppressed individuals such as those with exten-sive burns. Commercial cleaners maintain keyboards bac-teria-free for about 48 hours. A benefit {{of one of the most}} intriguing new keyboards, the holographic or projection keyboard, is that the flat surface used for its projection can be easily cleaned. A laser projects an image of a keyboard onto any flat surface, detects keystrokes, and even simulates the clicking noise of a conventional keyboard. These are truly virtual keyboards, and miniature versions that can be used with smart phones have just hit the market. It does not matter which keyboard you use or prefer as all contain some bewildering keys. One of themost commonly used keys is the “at ” symbol, @, which shares the number 2 key in the QWERTY arrangement. @ means simply “at, ” “located at, ” or “at the rate of. ” @ has been present in keyboards since 1885 but became ubiquitous in the early 1970 s when used in the first e-mail messages. In other languages, the @ symbol is more colorfully named (eg, “snail ” in Italian, “monkey tail ” in German, “dog ” in Russian, and “little mouse ” in Chinese). 7 In Spanish, Portuguese, an...|$|R
40|$|Touch sensing is a {{fundamental}} approach in human-to-machine interfaces, and is currently under widespread use. Many current applications use active touch sensing technologies. Passive touch sensing technologies are, however, more adequate to implement low power or energy harvesting touch sensing interfaces. This paper presents a passive touch sensing technique {{based on the fact}} that the human body is affected by the surrounding extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields, such as those of AC power lines. These external ELF fields induce electric potentials on the human body—because human tissues exhibit some conductivity at these frequencies—resulting in what is called AC hum. We therefore propose a passive touch sensing system that detects this hum noise when a human touch occurs, thus distinguishing between touch and non-touch events. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by designing and implementing a <b>flexible</b> touch sensing <b>keyboard...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of {{applications}} relying on piezoelectric sensors has increased rapidly. New applications lead to new requirements concerning material properties and functionalities. In many of the (future) applications, such as artificial robotic skin, structural health monitoring and <b>flexible</b> <b>keyboards,</b> the necessity for flexibility and conformability of the sensor material is evident. The sensor material {{should be able to}} nicely follow the surface of complex shapes and sensing efficiency should be enhanced further. Therefore, the main goal of this project was to reduce the dielectric constant and improve flexibility and conformability of traditional di-phase flexible piezocomposites consisting of PZT particles in a dense polymeric matrix, by adding a third (gaseous) phase to the system. The presence of the gaseous component in the polymer matrix lowers its dielectric constant and increases the piezoelectric voltage constant, g 33, which is the scalar measure for the touch sensitivity of the system. The focus of the optimisation in this project is on the polymer matrix phase and the (micro) structure of the particulate polymer foam composite. Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) with composition Pb(Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 4) O 3 was selected as the piezoceramic filler phase. Elastomeric Polyurethane (PU) was found to be the most optimal polymer matrix system, showing excellent flexibility, conformability, viscosity behaviour upon curing and processability. Another advantage of the selected PU system is the large operating temperature range, which was found to be between 0 ?C and 160 ?C. Furthermore, component A (diisocyanates) of the PU system is able to react with water, resulting in the release of CO 2. Thereby the gaseous volume fraction of the foam could be fine-tuned and increased significantly. For open-mould production processes (0 - 3 random composites), adding 0. 4 vol% demineralised water (microliter-range) to the system resulted in gaseous volume fractions of > 55 %, whereas closed-mould production processes (1 - 3 quasi-structured composites) required only 0. 2 vol% demineralised water to obtain similar porosity. This indicates that approximately 50 % of the total amount of CO 2 formed, escapes the system in an open-mould approach. The reduction in dielectric constant was found to be proportional to the increase in gaseous volume fraction. The PZT-PU foam composites showed remarkably high g 33 values up to maximum values of 95 mV. m/N for unstructured 40 %PZT-PU foam and 170 mV. m/N for quasi-structured 10 %PZT-PU foam, primarily resulted from the significant reduction of the dielectric constant. Note that the volume fraction of piezoceramic loading has to be corrected for the increase in total volume due to the addition of the gaseous phase. The best performing composite (1 - 3 10 %PZT-PU) has a corrected volumetric composition of: 4. 3 %PZT - 39. 1 %PU - 56. 6 %air. The great performance of the new concept opens up routes for further improvement of porous piezoelectric composites and we are now one step closer to the realisation of the material that meets the (future) requirements for flexible piezoelectric sensors.
