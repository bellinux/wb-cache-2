500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

Lord!’ said Toby. ‘The Papers {{is full of}} obserwations as it is; and so’s the Parliament. <b>Here’s</b> <b>last</b> <b>week’s</b> paper, now;’ {{taking a}} very dirty one from his pocket, and holding it from him at arm’s length; ‘full of obserwations! Full of obserwations! I like to know the news {{as well as any}} man,’ said Toby, slowly; folding it a little smaller, and putting it in his pocket again: ‘but it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper now. It frightens me almost. I don’t know what we poor people are coming to. Lord send we may be coming to {{something}} better in the New Year nigh upon us!’ ...|$|R

60|$|There {{will be very}} {{probably}} at this point a slight applause {{from the back of}} the hall. Miss Briggs was <b>here</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> or her astral body was--as Maggie of the Cattle Ranges. The impression that she made is passed on to Isabella.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have had}} Fanny Kemble <b>here</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> I only heard her [...] "Romeo and Juliet,"--not less instructive, as her {{readings}} always are, than exciting; for in her glass Shakspeare is a philosopher.

60|$|I {{know the}} lady of whom you write. ---- left there only yesterday. The story may arise only in her manner, which is {{extraordinarily}} free and careless. He was visiting her here, when I was <b>here</b> <b>last,</b> three <b>weeks</b> ago. I knew her in Italy. It is not her fault if scandal ever leaves her alone, for such a braver of all conventionalities never wore petticoats. But I should be sorry to hear there was anything guilty in her conduct. She is very clever, really learned, very pretty, much neglected by her husband, and only four-and-twenty years of age.|$|R

All we have saved is in that bank--every penny. I wanted Matthew {{to put it in}} the Savings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of father's and he'd always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody." ...|$|R

40|$|Whitaker and Geoffrey Wood. All {{errors are}} of course mine. The views {{expressed}} are my own {{and do not necessarily}} reflect those of {{the other members of the}} Monetary Policy Committee or the Bank of England. 2 Six months on the MPC: a reflection on monetary policy Thank you for inviting me to speak to you <b>here</b> today. <b>Last</b> <b>week</b> I voted on the appropriate level of UK interest rates for the sixth time since my term on the Monetary Policy Committee began in June. Today I thought I might take the opportunity to reflect on my first six months. In many ways it is a very technical and narrow job. The monetary policy arena in which policymakers can have influence, by alterations in interest rates and the quantity of money, is the general price level and its rate of change, i. e. the rate of inflation. In some respects the central bank’s monetary policy role is even narrower in the UK than in some other countries because the rate of inflation which the Monetary Policy Committee targets is set, quite properly, by the democratically elected government and not by the Committee itself. The Committee has n...|$|R
40|$|THE TITLE OF THIS TALK CAME TO ME SOME MONTHS AGO when I was {{listening}} on ABC radio {{to my old}} sparring partner Geoffrey Blainey addressing the Press Club, and thought I heard him use the phrase `The tyranny of ignorance'. A nice refinement of his original tyranny of distance! I wrote {{and asked him if}} I could borrow the phrase for my paper to this conference. He replied that I must have misheard him, as he hadn't used that phrase, though he wished he had; and certainly I should feel free to go ahead and use it. So I did so, and then in the <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> having received Neil McLean's summary and having considered other speeches both <b>here</b> and at <b>last</b> <b>week's</b> Sydney colloquium, I decided that my original paper wouldn't do, and needed re-writing entirely This is the version you are about to hear. It has been composed in the light of two major statements about the knowledge economy, one from each side in politics: The Australian Labor Party's manifesto An Agenda for the Knowledge Nation published in July 2001 and the ministerial discussion paper Higher Education at the Crossroads published under the authority of Dr Brendan Nelson in April this year...|$|R

Don't be afraid of me; I will not betray your secret. While I am here, I will address you, and will try to think of you as a very grave young matron. But I wish very much that you were not quite so grave and severe when you address me. When I was <b>here</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> your manner was very different.

40|$|The Columbia Accident Investigation Board has {{identified}} {{about a dozen}} shuttle program safety concerns it will address in its final report, in addition to foam shedding from the Lockheed Martin external tank-believed by many board members to be the direct cause {{for the loss of}} Columbia and her crew. As new evidence narrows the location of Columbia's left-wing breach to a lower corner of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) Panel 8 and its adjoining T-seal, the board is broadening its penetration of other shuttle safety issues. As the board works in Houston, United Space Alliance technicians <b>here</b> at Kennedy <b>last</b> <b>week</b> sent the first six of 22 RCC panels from the orbiter Atlantis left wing to Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. in Dallas for extensive testing to assess their integrity. The move is a key step toward both returning the shuttle to flight with Atlantis and obtaining more data on RCC panels subjected to fewer flights, and less exposure to the weather, than the older panels used on Columbia...|$|R
