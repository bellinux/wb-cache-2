On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> where the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was more sympathetic to the Allied cause than Spain. They finally arrived in London on 22 October.|$|E
5|$|The royal group toured Madrid on August 24, {{visiting the}} Royal Army, Museo del Prado, and Buen Retiro Park. The Spanish {{minister}} presented Kalākaua with the Order of Charles III.

5|$|Armstrong's {{instructions}} <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> were {{to negotiate}} an expanded {{treaty with the}} government. They arrived at Santa Apolónia railway station in Lisbon on August 19. Kalākaua was presented with the Grand Cross Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa during an audience with King Luís I at the Palace of Ajuda, and also attended a bullfight with Luis's father King Ferdinand II at the Pena Palace. When they left Portugal on August 24, Armstrong remained behind to initiate a treaty.|$|E
5|$|Garnet did {{not enter}} New College; instead, late in 1571, he left Winchester for London. There {{he worked for a}} legal publisher, Richard Tottell, as a proof-reader and corrector. He often dined with Sir John Popham, who as Lord Chief Justice was to preside over the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters, men whose {{association}} with Garnet would eventually prove so fateful. Although Garnet professed to Popham an interest in legal studies, in 1575 he sailed <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> with Giles Gallop, to enter the Society of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E

5|$|Otherwise, {{their stay}} in Paris {{was filled with}} well-wishers who came to call at the hotel. Queen Victoria sent her chargé d'affaires to present him with the Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. After days of visitors, which {{included}} world dignitaries and representatives of two different Masonic lodges, Kalākaua and friends attended a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida. He was given {{a tour of the}} headquarters of Le Figaro, and visited the Société de géographie. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, left on the evening train, bound <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government. Small differences in the opinion polls for the traditional three big parties (the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election.|$|E
5|$|After Cristiano Ronaldo's {{transfer}} to Real Madrid in the 2009 close season, {{the weight of}} expectation was on Nani to step up from bit part player and replace his compatriot. Nani's first contribution to United's new season was opening the scoring in the tenth minute of the 2009 FA Community Shield, but United eventually lost the match on penalties after a 2–2 draw. Nani suffered a dislocated shoulder during the match, which was originally expected {{to keep him out}} of the start of the season. He recovered in time to play 17 minutes <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> against Liechtenstein on 12 August, however, and started the match against Birmingham City on 16 August. Although he provided the assist for Wayne Rooney's winning goal in the 34th minute, Nani was replaced by Ryan Giggs at half-time. On 22 August, Nani scored his first league goal of the 2009–10 season, a free-kick against Wigan Athletic in a 0–5 away win.|$|E

5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls {{for the return of}} the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was not right <b>for</b> <b>Portugal</b> to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the {{elevation}} of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{starts in}} 1476 as Francisco leads Portuguese troops under Prince Juan {{to victory in}} the Battle of Toro by destroying Aragonese military camps and capturing Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. He then launches raids on supporters of Queen Isabella. In the end, the battle is indecisive, but King Afonso receives assurances from Spain that the African coast and eastern waters are a Portuguese domain. Thirteen years later, in 1489, Francisco serves the now-King Juan, in a mission to consolidate Portuguese control of Tangiers at an island outpost in the Loukkos River led by Afonso de Albuquerque, defending the area from Barbary pirates. He is then appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India by King Manuel, and sets sail for his new post. He plunders the Swahili coast along the way there, razing Mombasa. He then establishes Portuguese India in Cannanore and Cochin and confronts the Zamorin of Calicut who intends to undermine Portuguese rule of India, and who has suborned the allegiance of Kolathiri Raja with gold; Francisco then plunders the Malabar coast. He then moves to the Gujarati coast. Afonso de Albuquerque is sent by King Manuel to relieve Francisco of his post and send him to Portugal to face accusations of misconduct in the Indies. Francisco hears of the news of his son's death {{at the hands of}} a Egyptian fleet led by Amir Husain and refuses to return until he avenges his son's death. He converts Afonso de Albuquerque to his side and then takes revenge on his enemies in the Battle of Diu in 1509, including the Egyptian Mamelukes and the Ottomans. This being done, he sets sail <b>for</b> <b>Portugal,</b> being slain by Khoikoi warriors in modern-day South Africa while gathering water.|$|E
