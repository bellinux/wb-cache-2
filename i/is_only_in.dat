5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E
5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Some {{computers}} {{play better}} overall if their memory is devoted {{instead to the}} ordinary search and evaluation function. Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect). It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E

30|$|Every segment {{from the}} GIT of sheep harbors a complicated ecological {{bacterial}} community. Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 a and Table S 3 shows that Oscillospira <b>was</b> observed <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the rumen, reticulum, and abomasum. Succinivbrio <b>was</b> observed <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the rumen and abomasum, and Fibrobacter <b>was</b> discovered <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the reticulum and abomasum. In the small intestine (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 b, Table S 4), Prevotella and Ruminococcus <b>were</b> shared <b>only</b> by the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Methanobrevibacter, Lactococcus, Mogibacterium, and Pseudomonas <b>were</b> discovered <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the duodenum and jejunum. Treponema and Oscillospira <b>were</b> discovered <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the duodenum and ileum. As {{to the large}} intestine (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 c, Table S 5), eight bacterial genera, namely, Prevotella, 5 - 7 N 15, Bacteroides, CF 231, Parabacteroides, Treponema, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus, were shared with the cecum, colon, and rectum. Faecalibacterium <b>was</b> observed <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the cecum and rectum, and Campylobacter <b>was</b> discovered <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the rectum.|$|R
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity {{from the site of}} the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed {{as the head of}} an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts {{to the north and}} Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior to the islands becoming part of the Suðreyjar kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.|$|E
