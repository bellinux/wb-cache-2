50|$|The {{investigation}} spent {{considerable time}} analyzing {{the events of}} the fuel dump in order to identify the likeliest source of the ignition. Hancox reported that as soon as Captain Plata commenced dumping fuel, he observed sparks and flame {{in the vicinity of the}} Number 3 engine, the inboard engine on the starboard (right) wing, opposite the engine with the propeller problem. The investigative board concluded that the vibration induced by the runaway Number 2 propeller had caused internal structural damage to the starboard wing behind the Number 3 engine, between the fuel tank and fuel <b>dump</b> <b>chute,</b> as this area would have been the symmetrical point of the vibration. The board considered this the most probable cause, but stated that it was unable to determine this with certainty.|$|E
50|$|Fuel Boost Pump Switch - Controls the {{operation}} of the auxiliary electric fuel pump to provide fuel to the engine before it starts or in case of failure of the engine powered fuel pump. Some large airplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost pumps in the fuel tanks pump the fuel to the <b>dump</b> <b>chutes</b> or jettison nozzles and overboard to atmosphere.|$|R

25|$|The cargo {{handling}} on Milazzo {{was intended to}} be automated and featured a railcar and elevator system. Two longitudinal compartments between the bottom of the cargo holds and the hull each contained twin rail lines spanning the length of the cargo carrying spaces. Extending {{from the bottom of the}} hull to above the ship's funnel were twenty elevator and crane combinations. To unload the ship, the onboard railcars were positioned under doors in each cargo hold which, filled the cars with the coal. The rail cars were then positioned in the elevators, raised to the top, and had their loads <b>dumped</b> into <b>chutes</b> that then discharged the coal from the ship. The ship could discharge all 14,000 long tons of her cargo in 48 hours.|$|R
5000|$|... #11- Underground Mining StationThe {{underground}} mining station is the Power Miners' mining base. It features two towers that are {{connected by a}} zip line and pipes. It also has a bucket that is transported {{up and down the}} zip line. The bucket carries crystals which are <b>dumped</b> down a <b>chute</b> and {{into the back of a}} bulldozer. It also has a dynamite shooter and includes two carrots. The set includes a bulldozer, three miner minifigures, and a large Geolix rock monster. This power miner vehicle is no. 11 ...|$|R
60|$|More {{than half}} the {{elaborate}} processes are 'lost work' {{so far as the}} quality of the stuff goes; but the markets insist on a good-looking leaf, with polish, face and curl to it, and in this, as in other businesses, the call of the markets is the law. The factory floors are made slippery with the tread of bare-footed coolies, who shout as the tea whirls through its transformations. The over-note to the clamour--an uncanny thing too--is the soft rustle-down of the tea itself--stacked in heaps, carried in baskets, <b>dumped</b> through <b>chutes,</b> rising and falling in the long troughs where it is polished, and disappearing at last {{into the heart of the}} firing-machine--always this insistent whisper of moving dead leaves. Steam-sieves sift it into grades, with jarrings and thumpings that make the floor quiver, and the thunder of steam-gear is always at its heels; but it continues to mutter unabashed till it is riddled down into the big, foil-lined boxes and lies at peace.|$|R
5000|$|Tipples were {{initially}} used with minecarts, also called tubs or tram cars, or mine {{cars in the}} U.S. These were small hopper cars that carried the product on a mine railway out of the mine. When a mine car entered the upper level of the tipple, its contents were <b>dumped</b> through a <b>chute</b> leading to a railroad hopper car positioned on a track running beneath the tipple. At some facilities, each car was tipped over manually—thus the name, [...] "tipple". In higher volume facilities, each car {{was placed in a}} machine called a rotary dump, which rotated the car to dump the coal.|$|R
60|$|No {{one could}} live at Silverado {{and not be}} curious about {{the story of the}} mine. We were {{surrounded}} by so many evidences of expense and toil, we lived so entirely in the wreck of that great enterprise, like mites in the ruins of a cheese, that the idea of the old din and bustle haunted our repose. Our own house, the forge, the <b>dump,</b> the <b>chutes,</b> the rails, the windlass, the mass of broken plant; the two tunnels, one far below in the green dell, the other on the platform where we kept our wine; the deep shaft, with the sun-glints and the water-drops; above all, the ledge, that great gaping slice out of the mountain shoulder, propped apart by wooden wedges, on whose immediate margin, high above our heads, the one tall pine precariously nodded,--these stood for its greatness; while the dog-hutch, boot-jacks, old boots, old tavern bills, and the very beds that we inherited from bygone miners, put in human touches and realised for us the story of the past.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 they've started {{digging a}} 600 metre long tunnel {{from the main}} mine in Ghelari to Retişoara's valley which was {{completed}} in 1866 {{at a cost of}} 111768 Krones and 50 Fillérs. Meanwhile, they've built a 790 metre long, 633mm gauge railway specially for horse-drawn ore cars. At {{the end of the line}} they've built a 160 m long <b>chute</b> where they've <b>dumped</b> the iron ore to the Retişoara's valley floor which was 90-100 m lower than the level of the tunnel's exit. After the ore was <b>dumped</b> down the <b>chute,</b> the carriers transported the ore to the Govăjdia Blast Furnace which was 4 km away.|$|R
25|$|By 1820 the navigations had {{fixed the}} worst of the barging issues, a road from the mines was {{systematically}} being improved easing the teamster's problems and the ventures began to make substantial money; by 1822 the two companies were combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company and both the navigational works and the mule road were re-routed so they reached Mauch Chunk, the mule road high enough to <b>dump</b> coal by <b>chutes</b> into barges on the town's quay. By 1824 the company was flush with cash, had been further improving the lower river with two way locks and seeking other sources, began buying more coal lands and eventually bought lands around Hazleton and Ashley and the saddle shaped mountain pass above at Penobscot, Pennsylvania (now Mountain Top) above both south Wilkes-Barre on the Susquehanna and White Haven on the Lehigh {{at the head of the}} gorge.|$|R
5000|$|However, Lehigh Gorge and its rapid waters {{stood in}} the way as barges could not pass the rapids. This relegated to {{shipping}} coal by slow mule train, which is labor-intensive and costly, as it is pragmatically limited to an eighth ton per mule. After 1818 fuel shortages were growing acute, and the partially barged and partial mule-trained coal deliveries by the Lehigh Coal Mining Company were unpredictable and sporadic. This problem was solved by Josiah White who leased the operating rights and also formed the Lehigh Navigation Company and began to systematically put into place the original series of dams and locks and channel improvements of the navigation from Easton on the Delaware the 40 miles up to the Mauch Chunk Creek, outletting in area of todays Lehighton, which streamside trail was the easiest decent for the mule trains to reach the river about twelve miles from the Summit Hill and Lansford mines.By 1820 the navigations had fixed the worst of the barging issues, a road from the mines was systematically being improved easing the teamsters problems and the ventures began to make substantial money; by 1822 the two companies were combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company and both the navigational works and the mule road were re-routed so they reached Mauch Chunk, the mule road high enough to <b>dump</b> coal by <b>chutes</b> into barges on the towns quay.
