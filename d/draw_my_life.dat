6000|$|Archie {{passed by}} {{his friends in}} the High Street with {{incoherent}} words and gestures. He saw Holyrood in a dream, remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded; he {{had a vision of}} the old radiant stories, of Queen Mary and Prince Charlie, of the hooded stag, of the splendour and crime, the velvet and bright iron of the past; and dismissed them with a cry of pain. He lay and moaned in the Hunter’s Bog, and the heavens were dark above him and the grass of the field an offence. “This is my father,” he said. “I <b>draw</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> from him; the flesh upon my bones is his, the bread I am fed with is the wages of these horrors.” He recalled his mother, and ground his forehead in the earth. He thought of flight, and where was he to flee to? of other lives, but was there any life worth living in this den of savage and jeering animals? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen Spike is {{a capital}} willian!" [...] exclaimed Jack, smelling at a ladle filled with his soup--"a capital willian, I call him. To think, at his time of life, {{of such a}} {{handsome}} and pleasant young thing as this Rose Budd; and then {{to try to get}} her by underhand means, and by making a fool of her silly old aunt. It 's wonderful what fools some old aunts be! Quite wonderful! If I was as great a simpleton as this Mrs. Budd, I'd never cross my threshhold. Yes, Stephen Spike is a prodigious willian, as his best friend must own! Well, I gave him a thump on the head that he'll not forget this v'y'ge. To think of carryin' off that pretty Rose Budd in his very arms, in so indecent a manner! Yet, the man has his good p'ints, if a body could only forget his bad ones. He's a first-rate seaman. How he worked the brig till he doubled the reef, a'ter she got into open water; and how he made her walk off afore the wind, with stun'sails alow and aloft, as soon as ever he could make 'em <b>draw!</b> <b>My</b> <b>life</b> for it, he 'll tire the legs of Uncle Sam's man, afore he can fetch up with him. For running away, when hard chased, Stephen Spike has n't his equal on 'arth. But, he's a great willian--a prodigious willian! I cannot say I actually wish him hanged; but I would rather have him hanged than see him get pretty Rose in his power. What has he to do with girls of nineteen? If the rascal is one year old, he's fifty-six. I hope the sloop-of-war will find her match, and I think she will. The Molly's a great traveller, and not to be outdone easily. 'T would be a thousand pities so lovely a craft should be cut off in the flower of her days, as it might be, and I do hope she'll lead that bloody sloop on some sunken rock.|$|E

40|$|The {{character}} of Amel, {{in the science}} fiction novel The Courtesan Prince, is an enactment of the author’s struggle to understand identity {{as it relates to}} gender, human nature and medically-induced changes in personality. As the author of the novel, I <b>draw</b> on <b>my</b> <b>life</b> experience as a primary source, with reference to the works which influenced me, in order to establish the targets of my interest and show why identity is crucial to my motivation as a writer. How Amel embodies both my hopes and fears for humanity is captured by the concept of “naked virtuality”, which I use to translate <b>my</b> real <b>life</b> concerns into the virtual world of science fiction narrative. This technique is explored in the greatest detail with regard to isolating the concept of sexual abuse from assumptions about gender, but also touches on questions about human nature and constancy of identity despite a traumatic personality adjustment through medical intervention. In conclusion, I suggest future applications of naked virtuality in other contexts...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the flux of cultural transition, emergent identities, and pluralism within a community. It explores a changing point of view beyond traditions and is informed by the ontology of “becoming rather than being”, to paraphrase William H. Hastie. This {{research is}} a response to the phenomenon of recent immigration to the town of Dungannon in Northern Ireland as a consequence of globalization and postmodern politics. Biographical narrative enquiry is the primary research methodology used as I <b>draw</b> upon <b>my</b> <b>life</b> experience to reflect on the condition of being an immigrant. This research project aims to initiate a dialogue of identity generally and specifically within the community of Dungannon. The agency of immigration within a traditionally homeostatic environment informs this inquiry. Through a series of exhibited works this research will question the validity of cultural community borders. I focus on the arbitrary nature of the “false closures” (Hall, 1987) that form identity and delineate borders between identities, and the realization that borders are points of contact as well as points of separation. The research is practice-led and is concerned with what is beyond the border...|$|R
40|$|The {{shifting}} {{landscape of}} digital environments today situates rhetorical scholars within complex intersections. Converging concepts in narrative, genre, multimodal composition, and social media beckon scholars {{to examine the}} fluctuating power dynamics of the Internet. With this in mind, this thesis explores the rise of narratives in blogs, YouTube as a platform for new media, and the <b>Draw</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> tag on YouTube. By comparing <b>Draw</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> to previous definitions of blogs, this thesis argues that <b>Draw</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> is its own genre and a tool for users to solidify their identities and experiences using multimedia. Using Kat Blaque’s <b>Draw</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> video {{as a case study}} compared to other submissions in the tag, this thesis also seeks to understand how Blaque’s narrative challenges the power dynamics in contemporary visuals through her submission. As a transgender woman, Blaque retains significant authority over her identity through her submission by guiding her audience’s perceptions. Her video represents a powerful way for voices who are traditionally marginalized to use multimedia to share and preserve their identities and personal histories...|$|E
2500|$|Songs in A Minor is a neo soul {{album with}} {{classical}} piano references and arpeggios. Keys incorporates classical piano with R, soul and jazz into the album's music. With influences of classical piano, classic soul and East Coast hip hop, Keys described the album as a [...] "fusion of my classical training, meshed with what I grew {{up listening to}} [...] things I've been exposed to and <b>drawn</b> from and <b>my</b> <b>life</b> experiences". Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as [...] "old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals". USA Todays Steve Jones wrote that Keys [...] "taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk". John Mulvey of Yahoo! Music called the album [...] "a gorgeous and ambitious melding of classic soul structures and values to hyper-modern production technique".|$|R

40|$|In {{explaining}} {{connections between}} art and politics in my arpilleras (appliquÈ pictures), I discuss themes <b>drawn</b> from <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>my</b> relatives 2 ̆ 7 and other Peruvians 2 ̆ 7 lives, and the experiences of fellow immigrants in the United States. In Alcamenca (Ayacucho, Peru), where I was born, we inherit from our ancestors the arts of spinning, weaving and sewing. In our isolated town, we lived from raising animals, agriculture, and textile production, and by barter except at the weekly market. As a child I wanted to leave, when people returned from the city for fiestas, with new clothes and jewelry. Later we did follow our relatives to those cities. In my town the sky is big and free for everyone, but in huge cities such as Lima, neither the space nor the sky above is yours, the houses are very close together, and pollution darkens the sky. We struggled to learn Spanish (coming from a Quechua-speaking community) and adapt to big city life - transportation, street vending, getting robbed. We dreamed of having our own home, building shanty towns of cardboard houses without running w·ter, and suffering from illness and malnutrition. I also show the national elections, with carnaval-like campaigns, as the media carries endless promises and lies. In my community as well, the parties offer tractors although there isn 2 ̆ 7 t even a highway, computers without electricity, and cell phones with no towers. Peru 2 ̆ 7 s many economic, political, and social problems pushed us to seek new horizons in neighboring countries, Europe, and for me the U. S. Here, I continue to develop my art, using new themes such as migrants 2 ̆ 7 struggles for legal status...|$|R

60|$|I had {{a curious}} revulsion of feeling that morning of our meeting. (Of all places {{for such a}} clandestine {{encounter}} she had chosen the bridge opposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of self pity, and eager for the comfort of Isabel's presence. But the ill-written scrawl {{in which she had}} replied had been full of the suggestion of her own weakness and misery. And when I saw her, my own selfish sorrows were altogether swept away by a wave of pitiful tenderness. Something had happened to her that I did not understand. She was manifestly ill. She came towards me wearily, she who had always borne herself so bravely; her shoulders seemed bent, and her eyes were tired, and her face white and <b>drawn.</b> All <b>my</b> <b>life</b> has been a narrow self-centred life; no brothers, no sisters or children or weak things had ever yet made any intimate appeal to me, and suddenly--I verily believe {{for the first time in}} my life!--I felt a great passion of protective ownership; I felt that here was something that I could die to shelter, something that meant more than joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid creation to me, a new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some sealed fountain was opened in my breast. I knew that I could love Isabel broken, Isabel beaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could love any sweet or delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't care any more for anything in the world but Isabel, and that I should protect her. I trembled as I came near her, and could scarcely speak to her for the emotion that filled me....|$|R
