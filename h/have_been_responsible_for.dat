He became a legend {{even when he was}} alive, and that legend is {{partially}} responsible for creating the image of the gallant gentleman capomafia (Mafia boss). He is widely considered to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad. However, he was never convicted of the crime.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the deaths of about 1.9million people worldwide. It is estimated that 10,000people per year perish due to tropical cyclones.

5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} the film would win {{most of its}} Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. Variety reported that block voting by screen extras deprived Citizen Kane of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the film receiving no technical awards.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} and riboswitches {{are thought}} to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly-related organisms. It has been proposed that, in the RNA world, RNA thermosensors would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> temperature-dependent regulation of other RNA molecules. RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could hint at a previously more widespread importance in an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} as {{to the effects of}} Pauline on Mexico, but during the passage of the hurricane over Magdalena Bay, a boat disappeared with its five occupants. Despite a large-scale search for the boat or any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Parker's {{perseverance}} {{despite everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may not}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions {{have the freedom to}} be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding who might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly {{the same group}} that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks {{can become}} {{aggressive}} {{in the presence}} of food and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a number of attacks on people. This species is of importance to both commercial and recreational fisheries across many parts of its range, with its meat, skin, fins, and liver oil used. It has been assessed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, {{on the basis of its}} low reproductive rate and high value to fishers.|$|E
5|$|Relief efforts began almost immediately, and {{hospitals}} quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving from across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, but were impeded by a blizzard. Construction of temporary shelters {{to house the}} many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found Mont-Blanc to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame. There are several memorials {{to the victims of}} the explosion in the North End.|$|E

5|$|The EEHVs {{are members}} of the Proboscivirus genus, a novel clade most closely related to the {{mammalian}} betaherpesviruses that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide, especially in young calves. There are currently six known species/types of the probosciviruses, and the most commonly encountered and most pathogenic form EEHV1 also has two chimeric subtypes, 1A and 1B., as well as numerous distinct strains.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center briefly {{assessed}} {{a minimal}} {{threat to the}} Lesser Antilles, with one forecaster noting a 5% probability for the cyclone to produce tropical storm winds on Barbuda. However, Karen stayed in the open Atlantic Ocean and never affected any land area. No incidents of damage or casualties were reported. No ship reports of tropical storm-force or stronger were received. Some of the vorticity from Karen's remnants may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{the development of the}} short-lived Tropical Depression Fifteen on October 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{most active}} volcanoes are Kelud and Merapi on Java island which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{thousands}} of {{deaths in the}} region. Since AD 1000, Kelut has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), while Mount Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Mount Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity.|$|E
