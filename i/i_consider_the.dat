25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were {{deprived}} by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E

500|$|This pessimistic view of {{the future}} was, not surprisingly, poorly received: [...] "Reviews, whether in liberal or {{conservative}} magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive." [...] Barbauld, stunned by the reaction, retreated from the public eye. Even when Britain {{was on the verge}} of winning the war, Barbauld could not be joyous. She wrote to a friend, [...] "I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte, when <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion." ...|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1850s, Evans and Foster visited Scotland {{to create}} {{sketches}} {{for a series}} of guide books, which Evans printed. He later engraved Foster's illustrations for Lady of the Lake, and Foster's illustrations for The Poetical Works of George Herbert (1856), printed in Edinburgh. Of the George Herbert engravings he states: [...] "these illustrations <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> best that I ever engraved". By 1856 Evans had [...] "perfected a process of colour printing from wood blocks", and achieved a reputation as the preeminent wood engraver and best colour printer in London.|$|E

Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind.

[...] He replied: [...] "All of the publicity in the world doesn't help you win. [...] I don't feel slighted because Archie is in our conference. [...] I feel I'm just as good as he is." [...] Bell later recalled: [...] "Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest, and <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> second game a personal victory.

500|$|The Baltic Project {{was only}} one {{justification}} for the ships. [...] Admiral Fisher {{wrote in a letter}} to the DNC on 16 March 1915: [...] "I've told the First Lord that the more that <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> qualities of your design of the Big Light Battle Cruisers, the more that I am impressed by its exceeding excellence and simplicity—all the three vital requisites of gunpower, speed and draught so well balanced!" [...] In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher's belief in the paramount importance of speed over everything else. Fisher's adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912–13 Naval Estimates. In the letter, dated April 1912, Fisher stated: [...] "There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT INCREASE IN SPEED ... your speed must vastly exceed [...] your possible enemy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ethelbert Hitchcock — Wolfe's {{contact in}} London who handles {{enquiries}} {{to be made}} in Europe. Although he is usually identified by only his surname, in The Rubber Band (chapter 10) Archie refers to him as Ethelbert Hitchcock, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> all-time low for a name for a snoop, even in England." [...] Wolfe also identifies him by that full name when speaking to FBI investigator Stahl in Over My Dead Body (chapter 15). Some years later, in The Black Mountain (chapter 4), it is Geoffrey Hitchcock who meets Wolfe and Archie at the airport.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of pressurisation, the Mk VIII {{differed}} little from the Mk VII. Some early production models had extended wingtips but the majority were fitted with the standard version; according to Supermarine's Chief Test pilot Jeffrey Quill [...] "When I am asked which mark of Spitfire <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> best from the flying point of view, I usually reply 'The Mark VIII with standard wingtips.' I hated the extended wingtips...They were of no practical value to the Mark VIII and simply reduced the aileron response and the rate of roll." [...] There were three sub-variants for low altitude (LF Mk VIII), medium altitude (F Mk VIII) and high altitude (HF Mk VIII) which were powered respectively by the Merlin 66, Merlin 63 and Merlin 70 engines.|$|E

[...] His first point was that [...] "The landing operation must under no circumstances fail. A failure could leave political consequences, which would go far beyond the military ones." [...] He believed that the Luftwaffe could meet its essential objectives, but if the Kriegsmarine could not meet the operational requirements of the Army for an attack on a broad front with two divisions landed within four days, followed promptly by three further divisions irrespective of weather, [...] "then <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> landing to be an act of desperation, which would have to be risked in a desperate situation, but which we have no reason whatsoever to undertake at this moment." ...|$|E
