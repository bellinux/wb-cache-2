40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how the strength of protection for geographical indications (GIs) affects the GI industry 2 ̆ 7 s promotion incentives, equilibrium market outcomes, and the distribution of welfare. Geographical indication producers engage in informative advertising by associating their true quality premium (relative to a substitute product) with a specific label emphasizing the GI 2 ̆ 7 s geographic origin. The extent to which the names/words of the GI label can be used and/or imitated by competing products—which depends on the strength of GI protection—determines how informative the GI promotion messages can be. Consumers’ heterogeneous preferences (vis-à-vis the GI quality premium) are modeled in a vertically differentiated framework. Both the GI industry and the substitute product industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality substitute good have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the substitute good 2 ̆ 7 s producers prefer <b>intermediate</b> levels of <b>protection</b> (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers’ incentives to promote are preserved).

The protection of more than 60 backbone amide protons in uniformly 15 N-labeled H 124 L SNase was monitored {{as a function of}} refolding time by heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. As found in previous studies of staphylococcal nuclease, partial protection was observed for a subset of amide protons even at the earliest folding time point (10 msec).

As a result, they are of relatively small power and should be connected without commutating apparata to low and medium voltage radial power lines. The protection of this power line loses accuracy. To what extent current or distant protection is impaired, depends on many factors. The negative impact of DG is characterized by setting ratio (SR) : the relation of current or impedance setting with DG to these quantities without DG. SR depends primarily on DG fault quotients – the fault current of separate DG divided by total fault current of main source and all DG connected to this radial line.

40|$|Aposematic {{species have}} evolved {{conspicuous}} warning signals, such as bright colors and striking patterns, to deter predators. Some edible and harmless species {{take advantage of}} this deterrent effect by mimicking their appearance. Mimicry is a great example of how natural selection produces remarkable adaptations. However, while some species evolve a very close similarity to their models to effectively avoid attacks, others are successful in doing so despite an incomplete similarity, i. e. imperfect mimicry. In some cases, it is surprising how such a crude disguise can fool predators. Why and how imperfect mimicry can persist has been much discussed and considered as a problem for the theory of natural selection. It is therefore of great interest to understand what makes it possible. Predator psychology {{is an important factor in}} the evolution of aposematism and mimicry. In the past decades it has been suggested that certain components of prey appearance are more important to predators than others during prey assessment. We developed this idea by incorporating concepts from associative learning, and presented a new approach to explain imperfect mimicry. Our general hypothesis is that prey traits have different salience to predators. Certain traits are perceived as highly salient and are thus used primarily in the discrimination and generalization of prey, while traits with low salience are overshadowed and not used in the assessment. The salience of a trait can depend on how conspicuous or discriminable it is in the particular context, and can vary due to for example previous predator experience. We tested our ideas with wild blue tits and domestic chickens as predators, and artificial and semi-natural prey stimuli. In paper I we found that the trait that was perceived as most salient (color) was the one used to discriminate and generalize between prey. Mimics of that specific trait were highly avoided, despite differences in the other traits. We also found that salience is relative and context dependent (paper II). In a context where two traits were perceived as similarly salient, mimicry of a single trait offered <b>intermediate</b> <b>protection,</b> while mimicry of both offered high protection. In another context, the traits were perceived differently salient, and mimicry of one trait was enough for high protection. In paper III we tested a proposed scenario for the initiation of mimicry evolution in the edible butterfly mimic Papilio polyxenes asterius to its noxious model Battus philenor. The results showed that a partial similarity with the model in the salient black wing color offered <b>intermediate</b> <b>protection</b> from attacks, despite a general dissimilarity. This thesis investigates the major questions of imperfect mimicry: the initial step of mimicry evolution, the persistence of imperfect mimicry, and variation in mimic-model similarity. We conclude that mimicry evolution can begin in a non-mimetic species that acquires similarity to a model species in a high-salience trait. When multiple traits have similar salience, multi-trait mimicry is needed for higher protection. Mimicry can remain imperfect if the differences are in traits with low salience, and therefore under low or no selection pressure to change. To complete the picture, we showed that predators can have a biased generalization toward a more pronounced version of a salient trait (paper IV). The evolution of aposematism could therefore be explained by gradual enhancement of salient traits.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The study population comprised 22, 434 men and 38, 469 women {{who participated in the}} Adventist Health Study- 2 conducted in 2002 – 2006. We collected self-reported demographic, anthropometric, medical history, and lifestyle data from Seventh-Day Adventist church members across North America. The type of vegetarian diet was categorized based on a food-frequency questionnaire. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % CIs using multivariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS — Mean BMI was lowest in vegans (23. 6 kg/m 2) and incrementally higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians (25. 7 kg/m 2), pesco-vegetarians (26. 3 kg/m 2), semi-vegetarians (27. 3 kg/m 2), and nonvegetarians (28. 8 kg/m 2). Prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased from 2. 9 % in vegans to 7. 6 % in nonvegetarians; the prevalence was intermediate in participants consuming lacto-ovo (3. 2 %), pesco (4. 8 %), or semi-vegetarian (6. 1 %) diets. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, physical activity, television watching, sleep habits, alcohol use, and BMI, vegans (OR 0. 51 [95 % CI 0. 40 – 0. 66]), lacto-ovo vegetarians (0. 54 [0. 49 – 0. 60]), pesco-vegetarians (0. 70 [0. 61 – 0. 80]), and semi-vegetarians (0. 76 [0. 65 – 0. 90]) had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. CONCLUSIONS — The 5 -unit BMI difference between vegans and nonvegetarians indicates a substantial potential of vegetarianism to protect against obesity.

40|$|Acute lower {{respiratory}} tract infections are a persistent and pervasive public health burden, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hospitalization rates due to pneumonia fall dramatically during early childhood, remain low during early adult years, and then increase steadily around middle age. The low-susceptibility period of early adulthood is likely due to frequent respiratory exposures to diverse pneumococcal serotypes resulting in serotype-independent heterotypic immunity. We hypothesize that resolution of repeated respiratory pneumococcal infections establish capsule-independent, lung-resident adaptive immunity that protects against subsequent unrelated pneumococcal pneumonia. In our model of naturally acquired heterotypic immunity, mice are infected with diverse serotypes of pneumococci in the {{respiratory tract}}, given time to recover, and then challenged by pulmonary infection with a highly virulent serotype 3 pneumococcus (Sp 3). Prior exposures to unrelated pneumococci resulted in multi-log reductions in Sp 3 bacterial lung burdens and long-term sterilizing immunity. The enhanced lung defense during pneumonia included more Th 17 cells in the lung and significantly elevated IL- 17 A as well as neutrophils in the airspaces. Depletion of CD 4 + cells resulted in less effective antibacterial defense. Upon ex vivo stimulation with pneumococcus lung-resident CD 4 + cells produced multiple protective cytokines including IL- 17 A, IFN-γ, IL- 22, IL- 2, and TNF-α. In protected lungs, there were increased numbers of CD 4 + resident memory T (TRM) cells, confined to the anatomic region of the initial infections. Heterotypic protection was also confined {{to the site of}} previous pneumococcal infections. Previously-exposed mice challenged in their contralateral lobes were not protected. RNAseq analysis of heterotypic lungs 24 h after Sp 3 infection revealed an enrichment of lymphocyte-related pathways including immunoglobulin and other B cell-related genes. B cell-deficient µMT-/- mice exposed to pneumococci had <b>intermediate</b> <b>protection</b> against Sp 3 pneumonia, better than naïve mice but less effective than fully immunocompetent peers. Plasma from mice previously exposed to pneumococci was sufficient to protect naïve mice against Sp 3 pneumonia. We conclude that mechanisms of naturally-acquired heterotypic protection against pneumococcus involve both lung-resident cell-mediated and humoral immunity and importantly this protection can be compartmentalized within the lung. Advancing our understanding of these mechanisms will guide future vaccine development and treatment strategies for lung disease...|$|E
40|$|The elusive {{function}} of PrPC hampers {{the understanding of}} the molecular mechanism at the basis of prion diseases, and the development of suitable therapeutic protocols. Use of cell model systems, and genetically modified animals, have nevertheless suggested a number of potential roles for the protein, ranging from cell survival to differentiation. Because we now know that muscle is involved in PrPC pathophysiology, we have considered intact heart paradigms for the in situ study of the cell-protecting {{function of}} PrPC. Isolated muscle organs retain the cell native environment and are also more suitable to experimental designs than whole animals. Accordingly, by taking advantage of mice expressing different PrPC amounts (WT, KO and overexpressors(OE)), the protection of PrPC against cell oxidative injuries was investigated in isolated hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion protocols that involve oxidative stress. In line with the putative capability of PrPC to antagonize oxidative injury and cell death mechanisms, our prediction was that hearts from adult PrPC-KO mice manifest an overt phenotype after ischemic challenge, resulting in exacerbation of heart oxidative damage. Conversely, PrPC overexpressing mice should demonstrate a higher resistance over ROS production. Myocardial viability was assessed by lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the coronary effluent, while quantification, by immunoblot assays, of myocardial damage was based on myofibrillar protein oxidation. We found that in PrPC-OE hearts 15 min-reperfusion after 40 min of no-flow ischemia was associated with a lower LDH release, compared to hearts from KO and WT mice. We then reasoned that absence of PrPC should increase the effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC), in contrast to the less evident protection in hearts from PrPC-OE mice, i. e. PrPC acts as an antioxidant. Indeed, our data on hearts subjected to IPC nicely fits with this prediction, given that IPC led to a strong decrease of damage in PrPC-KO hearts, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>protection</b> in WT hearts, and no significant effect in PrPC-OE hearts. We also applied protocols of non-ischemic oxidative injury, by subjecting isolated hearts to perfusion with hydrogen peroxide. Such treatment was associated with a significantly larger LDH release in PrPC-KO hearts, compared to hearts from WT and OE mice. The protection by PrPC over ROS damage was also evident from the myofibrillar (tropomyosin) oxidation pattern of the hearts isolated from the different animals, under the used experimental protocols. This data thus supports both the value of the in situ muscle paradigm for studying the physiologic function of PrPC, and the role of PrPC against oxidative insults...|$|E

The scheme is intended for MV overhead lines for which the autoreclosure function is applied to enhance reliability of supply in case of <b>intermediate</b> (vanishing) faults. <b>Protection</b> stabilisation {{is required for the}} feeders supplying a part of network with numerous loaded MV/LV transformers that may face inrush conditions after reenergising the line.

The new FL protection developed takes both current and voltage signals for further processing and final decision is issued as a result of aggregation of partial decision support coefficients. Application of signal fuzzification and fuzzy settings enables obtaining a relay with increased sensitivity, reliability and much faster than commonly available solutions.

Classically activated mouse macrophages acquire antimicrobial activity that is largely dependent on the production of reactive nitrogen <b>intermediates.</b> However, <b>protection</b> against important intracellular pathogens can {{take place in the}} absence of IFN-γ and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS 2). Using Toxoplasma gondii as a model, we investigated if CD 40 signaling generates mouse macrophages with effector function against an intracellular pathogen despite the absence of priming with IFN-γ and lack of production of reactive nitrogen intermediates. CD 40 -stimulated macrophages acquired anti-T. gondii activity that was not inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody but was ablated by the neutralization of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, while the induction of anti-T. gondii activity in response to CD 40 stimulation was unimpaired in macrophages from IFN-γ−/− mice, macrophages from TNF receptor 1 / 2 −/− mice failed to respond to CD 40 engagement. In contrast to IFN-γ-lipopolysaccharide, CD 40 stimulation did not induce NOS 2 expression and did not trigger production of reactive nitrogen intermediates. Neither NG-monomethyl-l-arginine nor diphenyleneiodonium chloride affected the induction of anti-T. gondii activity in response to CD 40. Finally, macrophages from NOS 2 −/− mice acquired anti-T. gondii activity in response to CD 40 stimulation that was similar to that of macrophages from wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that CD 40 induces the antimicrobial activity of macrophages against an intracellular pathogen despite the lack of two central features of classically activated macrophages: priming with IFN-γ and production of reactive nitrogen intermediates...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new Robust Optimization method {{for the energy}} {{offering}} problem of a price-taker generating company that wants to build offering curves for its generation units, {{in order to maximize}} its profit while taking into account the uncertainty of market price. Our investigations have been motivated by a critique to another Robust Optimization method proposed in [Baringo and Conejo, 2011], which entails the solution of a sequence of robust optimization problems imposing full protection and defined over a sequence of nested subintervals of market prices: this method presents a number of issues that may severely limit its application and computational efficiency in practice and that may expose a company to the risk of presenting offering curves resulting into suboptimal or even infeasible accepted offers. To tackle all such issues, our method provides for solving one single robust counterpart, considering an <b>intermediate</b> level of <b>protection</b> between null and full protection, and to make energy offers at zero price, practically eliminating the risk of non-acceptance. Computational results on instances provided by our industrial partners show that our new method is able to grant a great improvement in profit. Comment: Fabio D'Andreagiovanni is First Autho...|$|R

While inflation differentials in a monetary union can be benign, reflecting a catch-up process, or an adjustment mechanism to asymmetric shocks or different business cycles, they may also indicate distortions related to inefficiencies in domestic product and labor markets that amplify or make more persistent the impact of shocks on inflation. The paper examines the determinants of inflation differentials in the euro area, with emphasis on the role of country specific labor and product market institutions. The analysis uses a traditional backwardlooking Phillips curve equation and augments it to explore the role of collective bargaining systems, union density, employment protection, and product market regulation.

30|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} on the specific underlying sources of the inflation differentials among the euro area countries, although {{there may be a}} consensus {{about the fact that they}} are rooted on structural or institutional factors—see for instance Jaumotte and Morsy (2012) and Beck et al. (2009). In this respect, Jaumotte and Morsy (2012), for a panel of 10 euro area countries (period 1983 – 2007), conclude that in order to reduce the persistent inflation differentials the following labor elements have to be reformed: high employment <b>protection,</b> <b>intermediate</b> coordination of collective bargaining and high union density. In this line, de Haan (2010) highlights that most empirical research suggests that EMU has not spurred labor market reform. However, Beck et al. (2009) do not emphasize the labor factors for the regional euro area inflation differentials. In their opinion, those differentials are mainly accounted for by the costs of the non-wage input factors, the degree of competition and the economic structure of the regions. In other words, the observed long-run differences are chiefly caused by inefficiencies in factor markets and region-specific structural characteristics. They also remark that there is considerable heterogeneity in the economic structure of euro area regions such that even symmetric impulses—such as a monetary policy shock—can have heterogeneous effects.|$|R
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an endemic {{health threat}} in {{underdeveloped}} nations. Despite the significant effort extended to vaccine trials using ETEC colonization factors, these approaches have generally not been especially effective in mediating cross-protective immunity. We used quantitative proteomics to identify 24 proteins that differed in abundance in membrane protein preparations derived from wild-type vs. a type II secretion system mutant of ETEC. We expressed and purified {{a subset of}} these proteins and identified nine antigens that generated significant immune responses in mice. Sera from mice immunized with either the MltA-interacting protein MipA, the periplasmic chaperone seventeen kilodalton protein, Skp, or a long-chain fatty acid outer membrane transporter, ETEC_ 2479, reduced the adherence of multiple ETEC strains differing in colonization factor expression to human intestinal epithelial cells. In intranasal challenge assays of mice, immunization with ETEC_ 2479 protected 88 % of mice from an otherwise lethal challenge with ETEC H 10407. Immunization with either Skp or MipA provided an <b>intermediate</b> degree of <b>protection,</b> 68 and 64 %, respectively. Protection was significantly correlated with the induction of a secretory immunoglobulin A response. This study has identified several proteins that are conserved among heterologous ETEC strains and may thus potentially improve cross-protective efficacy if incorporated into future vaccine designs...|$|R
40|$|Hosts {{are often}} {{infected}} by multiple parasite species, yet the ecological and evolutionary {{implications of the}} interactions between hosts and coinfecting parasites are largely unknown. Most theoretical models of evolution among coinfecting parasites focus {{on the evolution of}} virulence, but parasites may also evolve to protect their hosts by reducing susceptibility (i. e. conferring resistance) to other parasites or reducing the virulence of coinfecting parasites (i. e. conferring tolerance). Here, we analyse the eco-evolutionary dynamics of parasite-conferred resistance and tolerance using coinfection models. We show that both parasite-conferred resistance and tolerance can evolve {{for a wide range of}} underlying trade-offs. The shape and strength of the trade-off qualitatively affects the outcome causing shifts between the minimisation or maximisation of <b>protection,</b> <b>intermediate</b> stable strategies, evolutionary branching, and bistability. Furthermore, we find that a protected dimorphism can readily evolve for parasite-conferred resistance, but find no evidence of evolutionary branching for parasite-conferred tolerance, in general agreement with previous work on host evolution. These results provide novel insights into the evolution of parasite-conferred resistance and tolerance, and suggest clues to the underlying trade-offs in recent experimental work on microbe-mediated protection. More generally, our results highlight the context dependence of host-parasite relationships in complex communities...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} {{subject is}} to determine the effectiveness of conservation areas, where different management categories are being applied, to maintain effective sexual reproduction in plants and their interactions with animal groups. To evaluate this issue, we compared the phenology, reproductive success, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation of the legume tree Senna multijuga in two differently managed protected areas in Southeastern Brazil: the Itatiaia National Park and the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari, from December 2007 to December 2008. Vegetative and reproductive phenodinamycs were registered monthly in 80 individuals; other evaluations included 104 observation hours for pollination (March-May 2008) in 51 inflorescences; besides, fruit counts, fecundity and seed predation. Sexual reproduction of S. multijuga depends on the transfer of pollen by large bees (Bombus, Centris, Epicharis and Xylocopa), as the species is self-incompatible. Bruchidae species of the genus Acanthoscelides and Sennius predate seeds. Vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics differed among sites. Our results indicated that ecological interactions were lower at the protected area, but the reproductive processes in S. multijuga were not ruptured or critically degraded. This reinforces the idea that landscape areas with <b>intermediate</b> levels of <b>protection,</b> such as environmental protection areas, are suitable as buffer zones, and thus, relevant to the conservation of ecological processes when associated with more strictly protected areas.

40|$|Hosts {{are often}} {{infected}} {{by a variety}} of different parasites, leading to competition for hosts and coevolution between parasite species. There is increasing evidence that some vertically transmitted parasitic symbionts may protect their hosts from further infection and that this protection may be an important reason for their persistence in nature. Here, we examine theoretically when protection is likely to evolve and its selective effects on other parasites. Our key result is that protection is most likely to evolve in response to horizontally transmitted parasites that cause a significant reduction in host fecundity. The preponderance of sterilizing horizontally transmitted parasites found in arthropods may therefore explain the evolution of protection seen by their symbionts. We also find that protection is more likely to evolve in response to highly transmissible parasites that cause intermediate, rather than high, virulence (increased death rate when infected). Furthermore, <b>intermediate</b> levels of <b>protection</b> select for faster, more virulent horizontally transmitted parasites, suggesting that protective symbionts may lead to the evolution of more virulent parasites in nature. When we allow for coevolution between the symbiont and the parasite, more protection is likely to evolve in the vertically transmitted symbionts of longer lived hosts. Therefore, if protection is found to be common in nature, {{it has the potential to}} be a major selective force on host–parasite interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAim {{to compare}} the outcome of {{patients}} whose abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ruptured following endoluminal repair with those whose AAA ruptured prior to treatment. Patients over a 4 -year period 434 patients underwent treatment for AAA with conventional open (n= 253) and endoluminal repair (n= 181). Of those having open repair, 216 patients had elective operations while 41 had operations for ruptured AAA. Four patients with ruptured AAA had undergone endoluminal repair previously (Group I) while the remaining 37 patients ruptured de novo (Group II). The patients in both groups were similar in age and sex but differed clinically. All four patients in Group I had major medical co-morbidities versus 56 % in Group II (p< 0. 05). All patients in group I had a known endoleak following endoluminal repair. All patients underwent open repair. Results the proportion of patients presenting with hypotension in Group I (1 / 4) was significantly less than in Group II (30 / 37). The difference in 30 -day mortality for Group I (0 %) compared with that for Group II (43 %) was significant. The four patients in Group I remain alive and well at follow-up 22 months after operation. The outcome for Group I was better than Group II despite the higher incidence of medical co-morbidities. Conclusion endoluminal AAA repair complicated by a persistent endoleak does not protect from rupture, {{which may not be}} accompanied by such major haemodynamic changes and high mortality as rupture de novo. Further long-term results in more patients are required to confirm this <b>intermediate</b> level of <b>protection...</b>|$|R
