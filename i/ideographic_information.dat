40|$|In {{the current}} debate about {{evidence}} based education comparisons between countries are in focus. Learning and teaching are influenced by a control oriented paradigm at a far distance from the persons concerned, e. g. pupils, students and teachers. In education other perspectives are called for in order to catch the complexity of educational processes. Nomothetic information about learners needs to be complemented by <b>ideographic</b> <b>information.</b> The aim of the article is to argue for some alternative ways of knowledge contribution based on {{the voices of the}} individual in special educational settings in relation to the rights to education for all. Narrative approaches have a methodological potential of openness and participation where the researcher is engaged in a dialectic interaction between two subjects. Making room for the voice of the Other and finding a view different from one’s own is suggested as a powerful knowledge contribution in educational research which only can be provided by the persons concerned. One conclusion is that the narrative approaches advocated for here have a potential that is seldom given justice in the present era of documentation and measuring...|$|E

40|$|Electronically {{available}} {{multilingual information}} {{can be divided into}} two major categories: (1) alphabetic language information (English-like alphabetic languages) and (2) <b>ideographic</b> language <b>information</b> (Chinese-like <b>ideographic</b> languages). The <b>information</b> available in non-English alphabetic languages as well as in ideographic languages (especially, in Japanese and Chinese) is growing at an incredibly high rate in recent years. Due to the ideographic nature of Japanese and Chinese, complicated with the existence of several encoding standards in use, efficient processing (representation, indexing, retrieval, etc.) of such information became a tedious task. In this paper, we propose a Han Character (Kanji) oriented Interlingua model of indexing and retrieving Japanese and Chinese information. We report the results of mono- and cross- language information retrieval on a Kanji space where documents and queries are represented in terms of Kanji oriented vectors. We also employ a dimensionality reduction technique to compute a Kanji Conceptual Space (KCS) from the initial Kanji space, which can facilitate conceptual retrieval of both mono- and cross- language information for these languages. Similar indexing approaches for multiple European languages through term association (e. g., latent semantic indexing) or through conceptual mapping (using lexical ontology such as, WordNet) are being intensively explored. The Interlingua approach investigated here with Japanese and Chinese languages, and the term (or concept) association model investigated with the European languages are similar; and these approaches can be easily integrated. Therefore, the proposed Interlingua model can pave the way for handling multilingual information access and retrieval efficiently and uniformly...|$|R

There is no statistically significant difference between the racially prejudiced attitudes held by black faculty members, as measured by their scores on the Anti-White Scale, and the racially prejudiced attitudes held by white faculty members, as measured by their scores on the Anti-Black Scale. 2. There are no statistically significant differences between the prejudiced scores of the black and white faculty members, as measured by the Anti-White Scale and the Anti-Black Scale, respectively, when these scores are stratified by sex, age, region reared, undergraduate school region, graduate school region, employed years at Atlanta University, formal race/ ethnic relations education, highest degree earned, father 2 ̆ 7 s or guardian 2 ̆ 7 s occupation, religious service attendance per month, political party orientation, pre-Atlanta University cross-racial contact, and Atlanta University cross-racial contact. 3. There are no statistically significant differences in the cross-racial contacts, as measured by the Cross-Racial Contact Scale, experienced by the black faculty members and the white faculty members before securing employment at Atlanta University and the cross-racial contacts experi enced by the black faculty members and white faculty members after securing employment at Atlanta University. One hundred ten full-time black and white faculty members, who worked at Atlanta University during 1973 - 197 **, completed a 68 -item Social Atti tude Questionnaire. The survey instrument was comprised of 16 factual items designed to elicit <b>ideographic</b> <b>information</b> for stratifying the obtained sample; Steckler 2 ̆ 7 s 34 -item Social Attitude Scale: Anti-Black/ Anti-White (SAS: A-B/A-W) and, two 9 -item cross-racial contact scales. Essentially, analysis of variance procedures were applied to question naire responses to test for significance of differences among means on each of the three major hypotheses. The criterion of statistical sig nificance was the. 05 level. The reliability, Coefficient Alpha was determined for the SAS: A-B/A-W (. 897 and. 9 ^ 1, respectively) and the Pre- and Atlanta University Cross-Racial Contact Scales (black. 813, white. 772; black. 769, white. 8 kS) by the computer program, TD. Faculty responses were stratified by race. Frequencies and per centages were derived to ascertain each racial group 2 ̆ 7 s responses to each questionnaire item of pertinence to the group. The SAS: A-B and A-W raw attitude scores and their corresponding T-scores were generated for the white and black subjects, respectively. Cross-racial contact quotients were derived. While stratified according to race, the black and white groups 1 mean responses to the subscales SAS: A-W and A-B, respectively, were assessed for significant differences among means. Further, responses of the subjects were stratified according to the aforespecified inde pendent variables; and, group means on all variables were subjected to analysis of variance procedures. 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the racially prejudiced attitudes that the black faculty members harbored toward whites and the white faculty members harbored toward blacks (p 2.
