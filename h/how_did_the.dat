25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> ones we now possess come to us. The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E

500|$|Humber was {{promoted}} to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give an extra day of rest to pitchers Pérez, Maine, and Pedro Martínez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6–2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9–6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, [...] "How did it come to this? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started {{in the major leagues}} until last night?" [...] He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA.|$|E

2500|$|To {{amplify the}} {{context within which}} {{polygyny}} occupies an Islamic relevance, one should look to the current debates surrounding polygyny in Islam, and more broadly, polygamy, and the implications that emerged from their contextual transition from the jahiliyya to the Islamic era.

[...] McFall found the discussion on the iconography of the 1970s and 1980s wargames to be [...] "path-breaking" [...] and noted that the authors convinced her of the [...] "existence of a community of 'buffs' who have made a fetish of the German army as super-efficient and super-heroic".

2500|$|As a discipline, {{art history}} is {{distinguished}} from art criticism, which {{is concerned with}} establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or [...] "philosophy of art", which {{is concerned with the}} fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the diploma thesis was {{to find out how}} an athletic club in Radotín functioned and was transformed mainly over the period from 1963 to 2010. The diploma thesis provides deeper findings about the relationship of local and all-national trends in sport as well as the institutional framework of sport in ČSSR and ČR. Nine research questions were defined to restrict the otherwise very wide problem area: Is there any similarity in the development of athletics at the local and all-national level? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> performance of athletes change in an athletic club? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> content of data registered in training diaries change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> catchment area for an athletic club change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> competition of an athletic club represented by other sports clubs or leisure time interest groups change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> hinterland and the equipment of an athletic club change? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> approach of schools in the catchment area of an athletic club change? How has the institutional framework of approach to sport (athletics) changed after 1989 ? The questions were answered using quantitative and qualitative data.
