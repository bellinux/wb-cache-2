2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted headlight <b>dip</b> <b>switch,</b> and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (low beam) {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) beams of a headlamp emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the foot-operated dimmer switch or <b>dip</b> <b>switch</b> was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver's side with high beam on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a foot-operated dimmer switch were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1954 [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] system automated the selection of high and low beams.|$|E

50|$|<b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in ISA architecture of PC expansion cards to select IRQs and memory addresses. Before {{the advent of}} cheaper, battery-backed RAM, <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> were also often used on arcade games in the 1980s and early 1990s to enter game settings such as difficulty {{or the number of}} credits per coin. <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> were very commonly used to set security codes on garage door openers as well as on some early cordless phones. This design, which used up to 12 switches in a group, was used to avoid RF interference from other nearby door opener remotes or other devices. Current garage door openers use rolling code systems for better security.|$|R

50|$|An {{intermediate}} {{stage of the}} garage door opener market between {{the second and third}} stages eliminated the DIP switches and used remotes preprogrammed to one out of roughly 3.5 billion unique codes. This system was backward compatible with the <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> remote codes, and each remote code (either with DIP switches or with a unique preprogrammed code) can be added into the receiver's memory by pressing the learn button on the opener, and can be deleted from the receiver's memory by holding it. While the code transmitted by the remote was still fixed, it was not changeable by the user (except if using legacy <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> remotes) and thus was much more difficult to duplicate unless two remotes shared the same code (which was very unlikely since the odds of two remotes sharing the same code was 1 out of roughly 3.5 billion except if legacy <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> remotes were used). This approach was an improvement over the fixed <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> codes, but was soon rendered obsolete when rolling code (which generates a new code on each press) devices became available.|$|E

50|$|<b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> {{are still}} {{used in some}} remote {{controls}} to prevent interference; for example, to control a ceiling fan (and its light fixture) that was retrofitted to a single-circuit junction box. The <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> set a different radio frequency for each transmitter/receiver pair, so that multiple units can be installed in different rooms of the same house, or different units of the same apartment building, without unintentionally controlling each other.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of <b>DIP</b> <b>switches.</b> Some of the most common are the rotary, slide, and rocker types.|$|R
50|$|Recently (since {{the late}} 1990s), <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> have become less common in {{consumer}} electronics. Reasons include {{the trend toward}} smaller products, the demand for easier configuration through software menus, and the falling price of non-volatile memory. However, <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> are still widely used in industrial equipment because they are inexpensive and easy to incorporate into circuit designs, and because they allow settings to be checked at a glance without powering the system on.|$|R

50|$|While Single-Player mode {{comprises}} {{between one}} and seven games, Two-Player mode consists of a single head-to-head game between two human players. While the length of Single-Player games is fixed by <b>dip</b> <b>switches,</b> the length of Two-Player games is determined by <b>dip</b> <b>switches</b> but also the number of credits the players buy. (Initial game time and time per extra credit are set independently through PCB <b>dip</b> <b>switches.)</b> Typical Two-Player game time is typically {{on the order of}} 5 minutes, but can be as little as 1-2 minutes. As the upper limit is based on pay-per-play, there is no upper limit although games longer than 30 minutes are uncommon. As with other games such as Gauntlet, upon reaching zero time the machine prompts players to insert additional credit(s), giving them the option of prolonging the current game.|$|R

50|$|DIPs are {{commonly}} used for integrated circuits (ICs). Other devices in DIP packages include resistor networks, <b>DIP</b> <b>switches,</b> LED segmented and bargraph displays, and electromechanical relays.|$|R
50|$|The <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> with sliding levers {{was granted}} US Patent 4012608 in 1976. It {{was applied for}} 1974 and was used in 1977 in an ATARI Flipper game.|$|E
50|$|The <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> package {{also has}} socket pins or {{mounting}} leads {{to provide an}} electrical path from the switch contacts to the circuit board. Although circuits can use the electrical contacts directly, it is more common to convert them into high and low signals. In this case, the circuit board also needs interface circuitry for the <b>DIP</b> <b>switch,</b> consisting {{of a series of}} pull-up or pull-down resistors, a buffer, decode logic, and other components. Typically, the device's firmware reads the DIP switches when the device is powered on.|$|E
