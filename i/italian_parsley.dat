50|$|Mao Sugiyama (born March 31, 1990) is a Japanese {{performance}} artist and activist from Tokyo, Japan who infamously had his genitals and nipples surgically removed on March 31, 2012 (his 22nd birthday) {{in order to}} promote asexuality and gender equality. Sugiyama originally intended to consume the genitals; however, he later decided to stage a public event where he cooked and served the genitals with button mushrooms and <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley</b> to the public for 100,000 yen. Although around 70 people turned up to the event, only five people actually ate the genitalia whilst the other guests dined on crocodile and beef. He and three other people who helped organise the event were later charged by Japanese authorities for indecent exposure which if they are convicted could mean two years in jail and around a 32,000 yen fine.|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{effects of}} {{different}} amendments on a naturally contaminated soil with arsenic were studied. Several soil characteristics were analysed and the behaviour of two vegetables (tomato and <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley),</b> {{in terms of}} arsenic absorption and translocation, was examined. The results indicate differences associated with the availability of arsenic in the soil {{in the presence of}} amendments: iron oxides (3 g kg- 1) tend to reduce arsenic availability and organic matter and calcium phosphates seem to induce the opposite effect. Though both plant species have been affected by arsenic toxicity, the response relatively to plant development and growth and to arsenic translocation was different. Tomato plants presented greater growth when organic matter was used as amendment in terms of height, leaf length, relative chlorophyll content, dry weight and fruit production. By the contrary, the <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley</b> growth presented the best growth when calcium phosphate was added to the contaminated soil. Though none of the plant species was considered as arsenic accumulators, the <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley</b> tends to translocate more arsenic to their leaves than tomato plants...|$|E

The results indicate differences associated with the availability of arsenic in the soil {{in the presence of}} amendments: Fe had no influence on arsenic availability compared with the unamended soil, while MO and PCa increased the avalability of arsenic...|$|E
40|$|Estudou-se o efeito de correctivos (óxido de ferro, Fe; matéria orgânica, MO; fosfato de cálcio, PCa), aplicados a um solo da área mineira de Penedono contaminado com As, no crescimento de tomateiro e salsa. Usa­ram-se, como controlos, este solo sem cor­rectivos e um solo não contaminado. Duran­te o crescimento mediu-se a altura das plan­tas, comprimento foliar e teor relativo de clorofila. Na colheita final determinaram-se os pesos frescos e secos. Os correctivos influenciaram a disponibi­lidade de As no solo, relativamente ao ori­ginal: Fe manteve-a enquanto MO e PCa a aumentaram. Ambas as espécies foram afec­tadas pelo arsénio, porém a resposta aos tra­tamentos foi diferente. A altura, compri­mento dos folíolos, teor de clorofila, peso seco e número de frutos dos tomateiros foi significativamente {{superior}} em MO do que em Fe e controlo. O correctivo MO apresen­tou resultados promissores relativamente ao crescimento e produtividade do tomateiro. Contudo, o PCa (12 g kg- 1) foi o melhor cor­rectivo para o crescimento da salsa. Three amendments (iron oxides, Fe; or­ganic matter, MO; calcium phosphate, PCa) {{were applied}} to a naturally contaminated soil with arsenic and their effect on the growth of tomato plants and <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley</b> was studied.

40|$|International audienceAntimutagenic {{activities}} of pure commercial chemicals and food supplements {{were compared with}} that of herb extracts using a method based on the umu test system for screening natural antimutagens. Of the 55 products investigated, 22 were commercial products, 12 were food supplements and 21 were aqueous and ethylic herb infusions. All commercial products showed antimtagenic properties. BHT was shown to be a very strong antimutagen. All food supplements showed medium or neutral antimutagenic properties, except for echinaforce and coenzyme-Q 10 which behaved as mutagenic products. All herbs showed antimutagenic properties except <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley</b> that had mutagenic activity. With regard to the metabolites, those from commercial products showed antimutagenic properties, except those from BHA and especially Biochanin A that showed high mutagenic activity. All metabolites from food supplements showed antimutagenic properties, except those from Fluxarola that showed antimutagenic properties. Metabolites from most herb extracts showed antimtagenic properties and those from thyme showed very strong antimutagenic activities, while those from camomile, rosemary and tarragon showed mutagenic activities, and those from celeriac and sage showed very strong mutagenic activities...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{processing}} and storage parameters on the survival of Salmonella on fresh <b>Italian</b> <b>parsley,</b> parsley bunches were dipped for 3 or 15 min in suspensions that were preequilibrated to 5, 25, or 358 C and inoculated with Salmonella transformed to express enhanced green fluorescent protein. Loosely attached and/or associated, strongly attached and/or as-sociated, and internalized and/or entrapped Salmonella cells were enumerated over 0, 1, and 7 days of storage at 258 C and over 0, 1, 7, 14, and 30 days of storage at 48 C using surface-plating procedures. Leaf sections obtained from samples after 0, 1, and 7 days of storage were examined using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Temperature of the dip suspension {{had little effect on}} the attachment and survival of Salmonella cells on parsley. Regardless of the temperature or duration of dip, Salmonella was internalized. Immersion for longer times resulted in higher numbers of attached and internalized cells. Micro-scopic observations supported these results and revealed Salmonella cells near the stomata and within cracks in the cuticle. Storage temperature had the greatest impact on the survival of Salmonella cells on parsley. When stored at 258 C, parsley had a shelf life of 7 days, and Salmonella populations significantly increased over the 7 days of storage. For parsley stored at 48 C, numbers of Salmonella cells decreased over days 0, 1, and 7. After 7 days of storage, there were no viable internalized Salmonella cells detected. Storage temperature represents an important control point for the safety of fresh parsley. Fresh produce is an important source of enteric path...|$|E
