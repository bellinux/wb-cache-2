5|$|In Coats Grove, Michigan, {{teenager}} Bobby Rich is berated by {{his stepfather}} Phil for not finishing his lawn {{work outside the}} house. Bobby runs into a nearby orchard and Phil gives chase. When Bobby's mother, Patti, follows them into the orchard, she discovers Phil's body partially buried, seemingly drowned in mud. Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> terror.|$|E
60|$|She {{opened her}} <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> {{a very good}} {{imitation}} of complete amazement.|$|E
60|$|She took it, {{staring at}} me with <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> wonder, and then she opened it mechanically.|$|E
60|$|Bertha {{did not say}} anything, {{but looked}} at him <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> open <b>with</b> surprise.|$|R
60|$|Heyst {{came out}} with an abrupt burst of sound which made her open her steady <b>eyes</b> <b>wider,</b> <b>with</b> an effect of immense surprise. It was a purely {{mechanical}} effect, because she was neither surprised nor puzzled. In fact, she could understand him better then than at any moment since she first set eyes on him.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} Ashe helplessly. Their <b>eyes</b> met--hers <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> perplexity, his bright {{with the light}} of comprehension.|$|R
60|$|He smiled his twisted smile, and Maud, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> horror, was {{compelled}} to turn away her head.|$|E
60|$|On being {{relieved}} {{from this}} involuntary embrace, Alric {{stepped back and}} opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> surprise, while Erling roared with laughter.|$|E
60|$|Kaplan {{looked up}} at him, his face white, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> terror. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came.|$|E
60|$|And {{now they}} came into a room so {{comfortable}} and even splendid that Twinkle's <b>eyes</b> opened <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> amazement.|$|R
60|$|Barney's <b>eyes</b> went <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> incredulity. Here was {{a pretty}} pass, indeed! The princess came close to him and seized his arm.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Thompson, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> open <b>with</b> surprise, jerked Mr. Boxer in the ribs, but Mr. Boxer, whose {{figure was}} a sore point with him, made no response.|$|R
60|$|His fair little {{daughter}} {{did not take}} the information quite so composedly: she fixed on me a pair of <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> wonder--almost with dismay.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{hurried into}} the bower. The next moment Judith hurried out into the hall, her fair face blanched, her fair <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> terror.|$|E
6000|$|DOWN {{the stone}} stairs Girls with their large <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> tragedy Lift looks of shocked and momentous emotion [...] up at me. And I smile.|$|E
6000|$|The girl's <b>eyes</b> went <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> horror. She turned {{upon her}} captor. [...] "Do these frightful creatures intend to devour me?" [...] she cried.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} the two {{stood looking at}} one another. The girl's <b>eyes</b> were <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> incredulity, with hope, with fear. She {{was the first to}} break the silence.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>eyes</b> {{stretched}} <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> surprise as {{she looked}} at him. But she said nothing. The same strange and wide, perhaps insatiable child-like curiosity was in her eyes as she watched him. He dressed very quickly. And her <b>eyes</b> were <b>wide,</b> and she said no single word.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Antoinette {{stopped in}} the middle of the floor, facing the candle, her hands clasped, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> fear. We started, Helene and I, as we looked at her.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{opened his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> {{surprise}} as this enormous amount was spoken of, {{and he almost}} forgot his grief in the visions of wealth that floated through his brain.|$|E
60|$|The {{boatswain}} {{was quite}} taken aback. He opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> surprise, and putting {{his head to}} one side, gazed earnestly and long at the boy {{as if he had been}} a rare old painting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he say so?" [...] {{said little}} Lucy, her hazel <b>eyes</b> opening <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> anxiety. [...] "I {{never heard him}} say {{anything}} of that kind; I thought he approved {{of what we were}} doing." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{there was a}} knock at the door, and the little maid came in <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> open <b>with</b> alarm, for she had heard of the afternoon's battle, to say that the constable wished to speak to Mrs. Walsham.|$|R
60|$|As {{the man and}} the boy stood {{staring at}} each other, it would have been {{difficult}} to say which opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>widest</b> <b>with</b> amazement. At first Heywood fancied the urchin was a wild beast of some sort on two legs, but a second glance convinced him that he was a real boy. The next thought that occurred to the artist was, that he would try to sketch him, so he clapped his hand to his pocket, pulled out his book and pencil, and forthwith began to draw.|$|R
60|$|He {{had gone}} {{about a hundred}} yards into the wood, when he heard voices and laughter--then a loud shriek. He hurried forward. In another minute, Grace rushed up to him, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> terror and indignation.|$|E
60|$|Tottie {{opened her}} large <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> astonishment, then laid {{one of her}} dirty little fingers on her rosy lips and looked imploringly at her visitor. Thus admonished, he spoke, without knowing why in a subdued voice.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur Berkeley {{opened his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> unspeakable amazement. 'What, YOU here,' he exclaimed, coming forward {{suddenly}} {{to shake hands}} with Hilda; 'why, I saw you only a couple of hours since at the Le Bretons' at Holloway.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{caught her}} wrist {{and turned her}} face towards him. Her <b>eyes</b> were <b>wide</b> open <b>with</b> amazement.|$|R
6000|$|... "She'll go {{down inside}} an hour--that is certain, and Savine will lose {{thousands}} of dollars," [...] said Summers, whose <b>eyes</b> were <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> apprehension. [...] "I'm rattled completely. Can't {{you think of}} anything that might be done?" ...|$|R
60|$|Eva {{had come}} {{gradually}} nearer and nearer to her father, {{as he told}} the story,--her small lips apart, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> and earnest <b>with</b> absorbing interest.|$|R
60|$|In {{the very}} front row, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> fear, sat this poor little child between her parents, {{who listened to}} the Minister with much satisfaction, and a little way back sat Beatrice, who {{had come out of}} curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tomassov {{opened his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> admiration at this, {{as though her}} lips had been {{dropping}} real pearls. The sentiment, however, was not uttered for the primitive Russian youth but for the exquisitely accomplished man of the world, De Castel.|$|E
60|$|The {{voice was}} small, to be sure, but it reached Trot's ears and startled her greatly. She looked intently at the grasshopper, her <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> fear at first; then she knelt down and, noticing the wooden leg, {{she began to}} weep sorrowfully.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} {{his mother and his}} brother and they looked at him; ghastly were the faces of all three, their <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> and staring <b>with</b> horror.|$|R
6000|$|Both Peter and Jumper {{opened their}} <b>eyes</b> very <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> surprise. [...] "Also," [...] {{continued}} Old Mother Nature, [...] "you forgot {{to mention the}} fact that Jumper never hides in hollow logs and holes in the ground as you do. Why don't you, Jumper?" ...|$|R
60|$|The other {{merchants in}} the {{newspaper}} and the bootblacking business, neglecting everything else, discussed the very remarkable state of affairs {{brought about by the}} boy from Saranac, until the partners had succeeded in rolling up profits that made Carrots's <b>eyes</b> open <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> surprise.|$|R
