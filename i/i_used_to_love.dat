500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song's [...] "hyper-personal lyrics" [...] were [...] "immediate and affecting". Immediately following its release, Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track [...] "Song of the Week" [...] in October, further adding that [...] "he song's spiritual sibling {{is another of}} Stefani's best works: 1996's No Doubt classic 'Don't Speak'," [...] but noting that [...] "this time around, coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove, the pain feels dizzyingly fresh." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised {{the fact that the}} singer was [...] "stepping away from the pumped-up vibes of previous tracks like 'Spark The Fire' & 'Baby Don’t Lie', also noting that [...] "eartache is immediately relatable (just ask Adele) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe." [...] Alex Kritselis of Bustle called it [...] "a fantastic 'comeback single' — a tremendous improvement over 'Baby Don't Lie'," [...] praising that [...] "when she repeatedly sings, 'I don't know why <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you,' during the climax, you feel it." [...] Music Times Carolyn Menyes agreed, noting that [...] "we haven't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days. After a series of less-than-stellar singles, it's safe to say Stefani is back." [...] In a later review of the parent album, Menyes stated she was [...] "impressed with the vulnerability [...] displayed", comparing it to Stefani's previous singles [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Ex-Girlfriend". Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels Like is evident on tracks like [...] "Used to Love You".|$|E
500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't know why I cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught you how to love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ryan Tedder {{spoke on}} his and Hudson's {{collaboration}} to MTV. Tedder explained, [...] "I did the title cut {{for her new}} album, I Remember Me. I produced and wrote that with her and it's, honestly, probably the most emotional song I've ever been involved with in my entire career... So I sit down and she's like, 'I hear we're going to work together,' and I'm like, 'Yes, we are,' Tedder recalled. She sends me an e-mail with a diary entry dated right after her family was... and it was, literally, her thoughts immediately after that happened. It started with the phrase, 'I remember me. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> smile. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> know <b>love.</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> laugh. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> hear things.' Tedder revealed that Hudson's private entry was 'about four or five paragraphs' and revolved around her initial response to the stunning loss. She said, 'You're the one to write the song. I want you to put music and melody to these words,' and so I pulled as much as I could from it and tried {{to turn it around}} and what we ended up with is 'I Remember Me,' which is the name of her album".|$|R

[...] Characterizing it as the album's epitome, Jason Ankeny of Allmusic said that opening song [...] "Vacuum Boots" [...] sets up the album's [...] "gritty, swaggering R&B-influenced rock, delivered with remarkable assurance and attitude." [...] "B.S.A." [...] is an electric blues song which [...] "swaggers like mad."

5000|$|Laine was {{the first}} and biggest of a new breed of singers who rose to {{prominence}} in the post-World War II era. This new, raw, emotionally charged style seemed at the time to signal the end of the previous era's singing styles and was, indeed, a harbinger of the rock 'n' roll music that was to come. As music historian Jonny Whiteside wrote:In the Hollywood clubs, a new breed of performers laid down a baffling hip array of new sounds…Most important of all these, though, was Frankie Laine, a big lad with 'steel tonsils' who belted out torch blues while stomping his size twelve foot in joints like Billy Berg's, Club Hangover and the Bandbox…Laine's intense vocal style owed nothing to Crosby, Sinatra, or Dick Haymes. Instead he drew from Billy Eckstine, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Rushing, and with it Laine had sown the seeds from which an entire new perception and audience would grow…Frank Sinatra represented perhaps the highest flowering of a quarter century tradition of crooning but suddenly found himself an anachronism. First Frankie Laine, then Tony Bennett, and now Johnnie (Ray), dubbed 'the Belters' and 'the Exciters,' came along with a brash vibrancy and vulgar beat that made the old bandstand routine which Frank meticulously perfected seem almost invalid.In the words of Jazz critic Richard Grudens:Frank's style was very innovative, which was why he had such difficulty with early acceptance. He would bend notes and sing about the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, which was different from the smooth balladeer of his time.His 1946 recording of [...] "That's My Desire" [...] remains a landmark record signaling the end of both the dominance of the big bands and the crooning styles favored by contemporary Dick Haymes and others. Often called the first of the blue-eyed soul singers, Laine's style cleared the way for many artists who arose in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including Kay Starr, Tony Bennett, and Johnnie Ray.I think that Frank probably was one of the forerunner of…blues, of…rock 'n' roll. A lot of singers who sing with a passionate demeanor—Frank was and is definitely that. <b>I</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> mimic him with 'That's…my…desire.' And then later Johnnie Ray came along that made all of those kind of movements, but Frank had already done them. - Patti PageThroughout the 1950s, Laine enjoyed a second career singing the title songs over the opening credits of Hollywood films and television shows, including Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, 3:10 to Yuma, Bullwhip, and Rawhide. His rendition of the title song for Mel Brooks's 1974 hit movie Blazing Saddles won an Oscar nomination for Best Song, and on television, Laine's featured recording of [...] "Rawhide" [...] for the series of the same name became a popular theme song.You can't categorize him. He's one of those singers that's not in one track. And yet and still I think that his records had more excitement and life into it. And I think that was his big selling point, that he was so full of energy. You know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy. — Herb Jeffries ...|$|R
