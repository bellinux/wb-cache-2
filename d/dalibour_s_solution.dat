The in vitro measurements were immersion tests of fishing-line specimens immersed in Nor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> at 37 °C.

40|$|It {{has been}} the general {{practice}} to employ culture methods in discerning whether Ascaris eggs are alive or dead. Although culture methods are most reliable, they are not without shortcomings- -the time required in going through the procedures is very long. The discovery of some reliable and simple methods, therefore, has eagerly been awaited. However {{little research has been}} done on this subject and no better methods have ever been developed. Sudan III staining method is one of the methods developed so far, but its reliability is doubted by many researchers. In an effort to devise a new staining method, the author carried out a series of experiments; sudan III staining method was first checked on the attempts were made to enhance the ability of eggs to stain by pre-treating them with acid and alkali, and finally a number of dyes, especially fatty dyes, were experimented on. As a result of these experiments, the author has developed anew staining method using Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> and has proved that it is superior to sudan III staing method. Further experiments were carried out in order to investigate into the mechanism of staining. A comparative study of this method with the staining method using fluoroscopic dye, which had recently been developed, was also performed. The results of the experiments are summarized as follows: 1. The eggs killed by heating stained well by sudan III staining method, but the eggs killed by other means did not stain well. Attemts were made to enhance the ability to stain by applying various pre-treatment but without success. 2. The live eggs stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> are not decolorized by alcohol, but the dead eggs stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> are decolorized by alcohol. It would thus be possible to discern by this method whether eggs are dead or alive. Although it has no absolute value, this method is superior to sudan III staining method and is availabe for experimental purposes. 3. It seems that the permeability of the egg-shell plays an important part in Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> staining method. Although results vary with the change in the methods used for killing eggs, it seems that the permeability of shells of eggs are enhanced when they are dead, thereby promoting decolorization. 4.
