50|$|A dog camp is an {{alternative}} to a traditional <b>dog</b> <b>boarding</b> facility known as a kennel. They are a relatively recent phenomenon, emerging in select areas of the United States, Canada and Britain, and are {{a response to the}} growing realization that there are fewer public spaces for dogs to run free without leashes.

Because dogs are highly social animals, the dog group environment offered by camps provides a less stressful experience than a <b>boarding</b> facility where <b>dogs</b> spend the majority of time in a kennel. Some of the activities at a dog camp include running, fetching balls or frisbees, digging, chasing other dogs, tug of war, paw ball (soccer) and just hanging out amongst playmates.|$|R
