50|$|The Solo add-on pack (released in April 2008 and {{available}} for download via the PlayStation Store) adds several extra gameplay modes. Endless Mode pits the player against a continuous onslaught {{of rocks and}} enemies, gradually speeding up the action over time. Survival Mode challenges the player to {{last as long as}} possible while the playfield is filled with indestructible objects. Bomber Mode challenges players to score as many points as they can using only bombs and a single life - primary weapons and the boost ability are <b>disabled.</b> <b>Time</b> Attack mode challenges the player to complete a planet's worth of rocks and enemies in the shortest time possible - losing a life in this mode incurs a 3-minute penalty. The PSP version also received its own version of the Solo add-on pack, with only the Endless, Survival and Bomber modes, along with two new soundtracks. The Japanese version of the PSP game already comes with this pack.|$|E

40|$|RTOS based {{embedded}} systems {{are designed with}} priority based multiple tasks. Inter task communication and data corruptions are major constraints in multi-tasking RTOS system. This study we describe about the solution for these issues with an example Real-time Liquid level control system. Message queue and Mail box are used to perform inter task communication to improve the task execution time and performance of the system. Critical section scheduling is used to eliminate the data corruption. In this application process value monitoring is considered as critical. In critical section the interrupt <b>disable</b> <b>time</b> {{is the most important}} specification of a real time kernel. RTOS is used to keep the interrupt <b>disable</b> <b>time</b> to a minimum. The algorithm is studied with respect to task execution time and response of the interrupts. The study also presents the comparative analysis of the system with critical section and without critical section based on the performance metrics...|$|R

This paper uses data from four national datasets to investigate trends in disability rates and examine socio-demographic characteristics associated with disability. Results show a decrease in the overall disability prevalence rate.
