Collecting bark {{pieces on the}} surface of ground stripped by the animals for confirming the stripping season was continued {{at the end of each}} month till August 1994. The bark of upper part of trees was removed and the exposed sap- wood was gnawed. Damage rate (number of damaged trees/ total number of trees) on the cypress was 34. 5 % in the branches pruned area, and 15. 8 % in the un-pruned area, respectively.
