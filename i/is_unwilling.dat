50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> {{to share a}} meal with a person living with AIDS, 18% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> {{to sleep in the}} same room as with someone with AIDS, and 6% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> to talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R

5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E

They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree.

5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> to do.|$|R

25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus <b>is</b> <b>unwilling</b> or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”).|$|E
