40|$|Large, regional-scale marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) and MPA networks face different challenges in governance systems than locally managed or community-based MPAs. An emerging theme in large-scale MPA management is {{the prevalence of}} governance structures that rely on institutional collaboration, presenting new challenges as agencies with differing mandates and cultures work together to implement ecosystem-based management. We analyzed qualitative interview data to investigate multi-level social interactions and institutional responses to the surprise establishment of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (monument) in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). The <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the monument represents a new model in US MPA management, requiring two federal agencies and the State of Hawai‘i to collaboratively manage the NWHI. We elucidate the principal barriers to institutional cotrusteeship, characterize institutional transformations that have occurred among the partner agencies in the transition to collaborative management, and evaluate the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the monument {{as a model for}} MPAs. The lessons learned from the NWHI <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> are critical as large-scale MPAs requiring multiple-agency management become a prevalent feature on the global seascape...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{concept of}} risk {{governance}} is successfully put upon {{the scientific and}} political agenda. However, this debate remains on a rather conceptual level, while empirical studies on ‘how to actually do it’ are still rare. Therefore, this paper aims {{to contribute to a}} further elaboration of the concept, taking the newly emerging discourses on complexity and their impact on the institutional dynamics of the Flemish environmental health risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> as a starting point. Methodology. A thorough discourse analysis is undertaken using document analysis and in-depth interviews. In order to evaluate the performance of the risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement,</b> an evaluation framework is developed based on literature review. Findings. The Flemish environmental health risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> succeeds in increasing the exchange information: 1) between the local, Flemish, federal and European governmental level; 2) between scientists and policymakers; 3) between environmental and public health civil servants; 4) between the general public and the experts or policymakers. Nevertheless, the analysis also provides insights into some shortcomings and recommendations to ameliorate this arrangement. The contents’ recommendations regard: 1) a formalized procedure for appropriate uncertainty management, 2) the integration of environmental health objectives in all relevant policy domains, and 3) further research and a socio-political debate about environmental health indicators. At the organizational level, a point of interest relates to the strategies facilitating co-production of knowledge and multi-actor governance. Originality/value of paper.

Under this programme, farmers are financially rewarded - by both public and private bodies - for their nature and landscape management and development activities.

40|$|Because {{seas and}} coastlines are shared between states, the {{formulation}} {{and implementation of}} marine spatial planning (MSP) should be transboundary by nature. The main argument {{of this paper is}} that MSP should be organized as a transboundary policy-making process, but this is hampered by the conceptual and institutional fragmentation MSP is facing. Based on an analysis of four transboundary planning processes in different European seas, the paper gives insight into the possibilities to develop and implement transboundary marine spatial planning (TMSP). To overcome the conceptual and institutional challenges, TMSP should be developed as a reflexive <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement,</b> in which the actors involved are able to change {{the rules of the game}} and to challenge the existing (national-oriented) MSP discourses. The paper develops four forms of reflexivity (unreflectiveness; performative reflectiveness; structural reflectiveness; and reflexivity) to assess TMSP processes and to formulate conditions which are crucial to develop TMSP as a reflexive marine <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} uses the {{analytical}} framework of multi-level governance (MLG) {{to investigate the}} implementation of EU’s participatory rural development (RD) policy LEADER (Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l'Économie Rurale" meaning "Links between the rural economy and development actions”) in Estonia, a country outside of the mainstream academic debates on MLG and LEADER. It provides insight into the restrictions on autonomy faced by the local action groups (LAGs), the local level implementers of the RD policy measure, at the doorstep of the 2014 - 2020 programming period of EU structural funds. Even though LEADER is well-known for its bottom-up approach and finding solutions to local needs based on local resources and potential, it is actually very much influenced by the MLG framework within which it operates {{as well as the}} rules regulating its implementation, which in practice makes the local level constrained in what it is and what it is not allowed to do. The thesis investigates why the implementation of RD policies may diverge from the originally devised policy at the European level. Based on MLG theory all the levels included in the LEADER <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> – the European (the European Commission), the national (the Managing Authority and the Paying Agency) and the local (the LAGs) – are expected to {{have a role to play}} in shaping the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The study first ascertains the degree of autonomy the EU level has intended to grant to the local level for policy implementation. As the second step it compares the actual implementation of the LEADER programme in Estonia to the EU level intentions and identifies a gap in-between. The study identifies that the restrictions which are causing the constraints faced by the LAGs have been introduced by the national level, not the EU level, and that these national level restrictions are undue. Thus the research finally establishes that the sub-national level has less autonomy in implementing LEADER than the EU level had initially intended because of the way the national level is involved in the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> and the additional restrictions it has introduced. This confirms the hypothesis that the involvement of the national level plays the decisive role in determining the eventual form of the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} effect of limited {{liability}} on corporate architecture. Corporate architecture refers {{to the use of}} governance instruments within the firm to control the behavior of employees. Four general instruments are defined that form the basis of the firm as a <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement.</b> These four are decision control rights, reward schemes, information systems and conflict resolution rules. Limited liability influences the way in which an incorporated group of firms employs each of these instruments. An efficient use of the governance instruments in such a group implies that lower hierarchical levels, incorporated in subsidiaries, will have more discretionary decision rights, higher powered incentives and less information requirements than a group that does not organize its business risks in incorporated subsidiaries. Corporate groups thus differ in their <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> from firms that have not organized in corporate groups. Alternatives that restrict limited liability have {{the effect of}} centralizing rights, flattening reward schemes and increasing investment in information systems. If corporate groups have attuned their architecture optimally, then restricting limited liability generates additional coordination costs. ...|$|R

40|$|Power sharing {{regimes in}} {{resource}} management, including co-governance and co-management schemes, are now common across New Zealand. These schemes bring together iwi and the Crown to facilitate various environmental objectives. These arrangements often utilise the tenants of tikanga Māori, {{in particular the}} concept of kaitiakitanga, and are generally provided for outside of the Resource Management Act 1991. This thesis shows how two iwi, Ngāi Tahu of the South Island, and Ngāi Tūhoe of Te Urewera in the central North Island, are utilising such schemes to promote the interests of their people. It explains that Ngāi Tahu have built up co-governance in a patchwork manner, utilising the provisions of their settlement to build three distinct co-management arrangements in Canterbury. The thesis shows that Ngāi Tahu have yet to gain full co-governance capacity, but may well have a future role {{at the table in}} regional Canterbury governance from 2016 onwards. In comparison, Ngāi Tūhoe have been granted a different kind of <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> that arguably goes beyond co-governance. This <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> is based off the fact that legal personality has been granted to Te Urewera, and will allow Ngāi Tūhoe to promote the interests of their people in a unique way.

However, that there are pitfalls associated with such resource management power sharing schemes that {{must be taken into account}} when planning for future arrangements...|$|R
