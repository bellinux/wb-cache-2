500|$|Barry and Oliver {{devise a}} plan to deliver Kendra and Carter as a ruse to {{get close enough to}} Savage to destroy the staff. The plan goes horribly wrong; Kendra's powers fail and Savage quickly overcomes the element of {{surprise}} and kills both her and Carter before using the staff to destroy Central City. Barry escapes and runs fast enough to go back in time to the point of the original negotiation before everyone else dies. Barry informs Oliver of his time travel and the mistakes that led to defeat.

According to the British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, no trace has yet been found of the tomb of Shoshenq I; the sole funerary object linked to Shoshenq I is a canopic chest of unknown {{provenance}} that was donated to the Ägyptisches Museum, Berlin (ÄMB 11000) by Julius Isaac in 1891. This may indicate his tomb was looted in antiquity, but this hypothesis is unproven. Egyptologists differ over the location of Shoshenq I's burial and speculate {{that he may have}} been buried somewhere in Tanis—perhaps in one of the anonymous royal tombs here—or in Bubastis. However, Troy Sagrillo in a [...] (2005) paper observes that [...] "there are only a bare handful of inscribed blocks from Tanis that might name the king (i.e., Shoshenq I) and none of these come from an in situ building complex contemporary with his reign."

2500|$|Although {{the story}} of a {{frustrated}} passion for Baron von Bleichröder has gained traction in newspapers and history books, at least one book described an entirely different story. [...] In Secrets of Dethroned Royalty by Princess Catherine Radziwill (1920), it is explained that Sophie, required by her family's financial circumstances to live in the university town of Heidelberg instead of the metropolis of Weimar, had fallen deeply in love with a young man (identified only as [...] "Count T.") of excellent but poor family. [...] The two young people planned to elope and to conceal their plans, the princess pretended to carry on a romance instead with one of her sweetheart's friends, Baron von Bleichröder, [...] "who consented with alacrity to play the part ... for he was flattered by the request to appear before the world as a suitor for the hand of a Princess of Weimar." [...] However, Prince William and Princess Gerta intended on another match (presumably more prosperous) for their daughter, and they persuaded Count T to leave Heidelberg. [...] Count T secretly arranged to continue to exchange love letters with Sophie using Bleichröder as intermediary. [...] However after the passage of time the Count, living <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>city,</b> found an heiress to his liking, and married her. [...] Apparently he had not bothered to notify Sophie of these changes in his feelings and she discovered these developments only by reading of his marriage in a newspaper; she was so distraught that she killed herself that night. [...] It was widely but erroneously believed that she was driven to suicide by the presumed opposition of her parents to Bleichröder, who, for his part, did not attempt to correct that impression [...] "with evident satisfaction [...] the prestige he derived from his position as the man for whose sake a Royal Princess had shot herself. [...] This awful catastrophe ... was for the Hebrew banker's son, merely a triumph of vanity, and he was glad to allow the world to think she had died for him." [...] This version has not received any currency, although a different story, to the effect that the Princess had previously been carrying on a doomed romance with a Lt. Edler Herr von Putlitz, has circulated. [...] The romance was doomed because although von Putlitz came from a family as aristocratic as that of the Princess, he was just as poor as her father. However, Lt. von Putlitz had died (possibly by suicide) in 1908.|$|E

60|$|On that hint I made an {{experiment}} <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>city.</b> There were three men of position, and importance, and affluence, each keenly {{interested in the}} development of their land, each asserting that what the land needed was white immigrants.
