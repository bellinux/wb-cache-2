50|$|According to estimates, 50% of the {{electricity}} generated in Argentina depends on gas-powered plants. The national energy matrix has no <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> and by 2004 it was functioning {{at the top of}} its capacity. At this point, barely emerging from the seasonal low demand caused by summer, a large number of industrial facilities and power plants started suffering intermittent cuts in their supply of natural gas. Between February and May the cuts amounted to an average of 9.5 million m³ a day, about 13% of industrial demand, {{and by the end of}} May they grew to a maximum of 22 million m³. The most seriously affected regions were the capital, certain regions of the province of Buenos Aires, and the province of La Pampa.|$|E

5000|$|Oats {{made up a}} {{considerable}} minority of the produced grain but stood very low in status and was commonly used as animal feed, especially for horses.

Pasta had been a common food since the middle of the medieval period, and gained in popularity during the early modern period (notably in Naples, where it was not often seen until the late 18th century), but it was not yet usual to use the hard variety of durum wheat or semolina to make dried pasta until the Industrial era. Rice became established in many places, especially Italy and Spain, during the period, but was regarded as a low-status food; the well-off might occasionally have rice pudding but otherwise ignored it.|$|E

40|$|Marketers of {{programs}} {{that are designed to}} help consumers reach long-term goals (e. g., lose weight) face twin challenges of making the program attractive enough to encourage consumer signup while still motivating them to reach their desirable long-term goals. I examine how incorporating <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves,</b> pre-defined slack with a small cost, within goals influences consumers’ preferences and performance. Overall, I find that consumers not only prefer goals with <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> (e. g., a goal of going to the gym 7 days of the week with 2 “emergency skip” days) to goals without <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> but also perform better with them. In Chapter One, I demonstrate when and why people prefer goals with <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves.</b> Further, in Chapter One, I also reveal that consumers perform better with goals with <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> than with goals without <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> and other flexible goals because they try to resist using their emergency reserve in order to avoid incurring the cost (psychological, opportunity, or future) for using it, leading them to try harder to reach a more difficult reference point/goal. In Chapter Two, I demonstrate that consumers persist more after a subgoal failure with goals with <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> than goals without emergency reserves; I find that the emergency reserve alleviate the negative consequences of goal violation by transforming a sense of subgoal failure into subgoal progress, leading consumers to feel more committed to their goal, and thus increasing their likelihood of persisting at their goals. By offering <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves,</b> marketers can not only attract consumers to sign-up initially but also help them reach these desirable long-term goals they have been struggling to achieve...|$|E

30|$|Governments and {{manufacturers}} that produce batteries, generators, {{and other supplies}} and equipment needed in times of crises must determine appropriate stock levels to support a potential initial response operation (Lodree Jr. and Taskin [16]) since holding large amounts of inventory is impractical due to high demand uncertainty, highly variable production times, and high holding costs. In particular, {{a certain amount of}} spare production capacity should be reserved to meet continuous demand, once emergency demand exceeds on-hand inventory. Li et al. [17] indicated that production capacity reserve is useful for the resources whose ordinary consumption is small in peacetime but demand is large in emergency. Nevertheless, disasters are so uncertain that many manufacturers tend to underestimate emergency demand in order to gain more profits in peacetime. In other words, it is unreasonable for manufacturers to take the risks of profit loss by themselves without any incentive from the government while executing <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves.</b> Therefore, the current study will attempt to address this problem by designing a win-win strategy which can increase a relevant manufacturers’ desire to participate in reserve work for emergency resources.|$|E

40|$|Social {{protection}} {{has emerged}} as a key development and humanitarian policy issue in the last decade. There have also been major food price shocks in many countries in the last 5 years. Interest in social protection and food systems is converging, and donor agencies and governments are looking at how different social protection instruments might better support the different components of food systems and maintain their resilience in the face of major shocks. This synthesis report is {{one of a series of}} papers developed for GIZ, which explore the impacts of different social protection instruments on resilient food systems, including cash transfers, public works programmes and insurance, as well as broader initiatives that contribute to reducing poverty and vulnerability, such as integrated livelihoods programmes, <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> and structured demand. The synthesis reviews the main findings from each paper, draws out patterns in the effects of the instruments, explores the main issues that emerge across all the papers and identifies what this means for those designing programmes to build resilience in food systems.

40|$|Using a {{political}} economy perspective, this paper establishes the {{strong relationship between}} rice and politics and explains recent developments in the Philippine rice landscape. Results of the analysis show {{that the price of}} rice has been a significant determinant in election results since the 1950 s, with the exception of 1998, where despite stable prices, the candidate from the incumbent administration failed to win the presidential elections. In addition, reliance by the Philippine government primarily on price instruments to achieve its rice objectives and to protect farmer and consumer interests has not resulted in any substantial improvements in rice production. In fact, the shift to rice protection since the 1980 s has failed to stabilize domestic rice prices and has effectively penalized the poorer households. This has been traced largely to the failure of the National Food Authority to provide timely, accurate, and appropriate intervention in the country 9 ̆ 2 s rice market. If the Philippines is to achieve sustained, stable rice supply at low prices {{and at the same time}} promote rice consumer and producer welfare, the adoption of a private-focused, market-based regulatory regime without a rice trading parastatal (but with rice <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves,</b> not for price stabilization) remains as a long-term objective...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} analysis of cost-effective dispatching of <b>emergency</b> <b>reserves</b> with a specific focus on supply and demand side options. On the demand side options {{the focus is the}} demand market participation product. On the supply side options the use of hydro and gas specifically the open cycle gas turbines are studied. In capacity constraint systems, supplying the demand with the current generation mix needs to be met. With a diminishing reserve margin and increase in demand yearly this challenge increases. The South African scenario is reported in this paper. As demand grows the ability to meet that demand remains a focus; a responsibility that remains a priority for the system operator. In times of surplus or shortage generation with adequate or diminishing reserve margins the focus on dispatching optimally and economically is an important aspect. Currently the South African Interconnected Power System is constrained; at times there is more demand than supply. The reserve categories are the ancillary requirements and are different for all power systems. Reserves are to cater for disturbances on the power system to ensure a healthy frequency is maintained. Reserve categories according to the ancillary requirements are: instantaneous, regulating, ten minute, supplemental and emergency. This dissertation focuses on emergency reserve...|$|E
