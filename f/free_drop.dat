The express area is located near the short stay car park while a free service is within the mid stay. A fee is charged for the express service. Terminal Road North and its <b>free</b> <b>drop</b> off area directly outside the terminal was closed shortly after MAG took over the airport in 2013. Since 2004, Stansted also offers a range of hotel accommodation including Holiday Inn Express, Premier Inn and Radisson Blu hotels and the recently opened Hampton by Hilton, the last two of which are both within two minutes of the Terminal building via an undercover walkway. There are regular bus service transfers between the Terminal building and Stansted's car parks and hotels.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods {{for getting the}} divers to the wreck. The {{preferred}} method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage {{is less likely to}} damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important {{to get back to the}} shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as [...] "parachuting in" [...] or [...] "free drop". The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. [...] Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions.

40|$|To ensure {{structural}} integrity during normal conditions of transport (NCT), Federal regulations in 10 CFR 71. 71 {{require that the}} nuclear material package designs be evaluated {{for the effects of}} <b>free</b> <b>drops.</b> The vessel stress acceptance criteria for these drops are given in Regulatory Guide 7. 6 and ASME Section III Code. During initial phases of the package design, the effects of the NCT <b>free</b> <b>drops</b> can be evaluated by simplified analytical solutions which will ensure that the safety margins specified in R.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} undulation {{instability of}} phase boundaries of smectics C is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The driving mechanism {{is more efficient}} than that of Herring's instability of crystal surfaces, due to the coupling of a periodic distortion of the c-director with the interfacial undulation. The instability is studied experimentally in various geometries: <b>free</b> <b>drops,</b> capillaries and sandwiched cells. In {{the presence of a}} thermal gradient G, the undulation period is shown to scale as G- 1 / 3, as predicted theoretically. The existence of a threshold reflattening the interface in the presence of strong thermal gradients is investigated. Upon varying the thickness of the smectic, a sequence of instabilities occurs which produces first the interfacial undulations, then focal conic defects as in the textural instability of the smectic-A–isotropic interface. In <b>free</b> <b>drops,</b> the undulation instability yields a richer phenomenology: arborescent patterns, splayed islands, spirals, trefoils, and eventually rows and triangular networks of focal conics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>drops</b> and bubbles are weakly {{nonlinear}} {{mechanical systems}} that are relatively simple to characterize experimentally in 1 -G {{as well as in}} microgravity. The understanding of the details of their motion contributes to the fundamental study of nonlinear phenomena and to the measurement of the thermophysical properties of freely levitated melts. The goal of this Glovebox-based experimental investigation is the low-gravity assessment of the capabilities of a modular apparatus based on ultrasonic resonators and on the pseudo- extinction optical method. The required experimental task is the accurate measurements of the large-amplitude dynamics of <b>free</b> <b>drops</b> and bubbles in the absence of large biasing influences such as gravity and levitation fields. A single-axis levitator used for the positioning of drops in air, and an ultrasonic water-filled resonator for the trapping of air bubbles have been evaluated in low-gravity and in 1 -G. The basic feasibility of drop positioning and shape oscillations measurements has been verified by using a laptop-interfaced automated data acquisition and the optical extinction technique. The major purpose of the investigation was to identify the salient technical issues associated with the development of a full-scale Microgravity experiment on single drop and bubble dynamics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Free</b> fall <b>drop</b> {{testing is}} an {{important}} part of the development of commercial electronic components and devices. In the process of optimizing the quality of their entire product range, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB have decided to review their <b>free</b> fall <b>drop</b> test equipment with the goal of increasing the precision, repeatability, and time efficiency of their drop test applications. In regard to the <b>free</b> fall <b>drop</b> test principle a robot system with management software, named Doris Drop Test System, is developed to meet these goals. As the amount of related work for this application is as minimal as the timeframes for this project, the development process is empirical and entrepreneurial with engineering skills as the governing line of work. Combining the competence from fields such as mechanics, electronics and product development, reaching the goals is successful enabling the identifying of two different drop methods – Impact Position and Drop Position. Increasing the repeatability from approximately 10 % to 85 % enables anyone at any time to perform the exact mobile phone drop test. By reaching a precision of up to 100 %, performing <b>free</b> fall <b>drop</b> tests aiming for testing specific mobile phone parts, optimizes the development process by faster detection of mechanical weaknesses. Achieving these results in parallel with increasing the throughput by shortening the testing time, has proven the success of the Doris Drop Test System. ...|$|R
