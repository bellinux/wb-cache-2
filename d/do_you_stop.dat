500|$|The developers' {{theory is}} that the {{international}} attention gained through large developments and having the world's tallest building will incur gentrification of the country and even be a financial success in the long run. Rory Olcayto, deputy editor of The Architects’ Journal, said [...] "The race to build the highest skyscraper is quite futile – where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop?</b> These buildings are a symbol of an old-fashioned way of thinking,” while architect Adrian Smith, the designer of the tower, states, [...] "...this tower symbolizes the Kingdom as an important global business and cultural leader, and demonstrates the strength and creative vision of its people. It represents new growth and high-performance technology fused into one powerful iconic form." [...] However, Bob Sinn, principal engineer at Thornton Tomasetti, stated that the practical challenges of building supertall buildings are greater than the structural challenges.|$|E

5000|$|The affair {{concluded}} with a Twitter argument when Nenshi responded to Levant's questioning. Levant questioned Nenshi about the ethics of city funds going to Pembina, if Pembina staff had worked on or donated to Nenshi's political campaigns. Nenshi responded by asking Levant rhetorically 'when <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> beating your wife?' ...|$|R

2500|$|During the campaign, a {{controversy}} arose when Barbour chose {{to speak at}} the Blackhawk Rally, a fundraiser for the Blackhawk [...] "council school" [...] in Blackhawk, Mississippi. Such [...] "council schools", also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as [...] "academies", were established by the White Citizens' Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the Civil Rights Movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that [...] "Once you start down the slippery slope of saying, 'That person can't be for me,' then where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop?</b> ... I don't care who has my picture. My picture's in the public domain." [...] Barbour's Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk rallies.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{go into the}} {{reserved}} seats," [...] rejoined her husband, turning from her {{with a look of}} disgust. [...] "There's plenty of room. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have missed}} you so, John. We have wanted you so much. Lucy and Kate and Deby {{were so bad}} yesterday, and they did cry so for you. We were all so hungry. We don't mind so much, when you are here {{to talk to us}} and tell us stories. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> away, John, when we wanted you so?" ...|$|R
50|$|With an {{alarming}} immediacy, the opening track {{of his latest}} EP Colours, <b>Do</b> What <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>stops</b> <b>you</b> in your tracks. The droning synths bellow a thick cloud of black smoke everywhere, leaving you deprived of all senses bar your ears, the beat is incredibly simple but highly hypnotic, and Halls vocals are more of an incantation than anything else, its a powerful piece.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> and how {{are your}} family? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> out at the door for? You're one of Mr. Blyth's guests, and have as much right inside {{as any of the}} rest of us. Stand there, and listen, and look about you, and inform your mind. This is an age of progress, gardener; your class is coming uppermost, and time it did too. Go on, Blyth." [...] And again the Dowager Countess took a pinch of snuff, looking contemptuously at the lady who had spoken of the [...] "mixture of people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] replied Nerle; [...] "it {{is always}} best to hope." [...] And then he inquired: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here, {{in the middle}} of the path?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far, so good," [...] James said. [...] "Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here, while I crawl {{forward to}} the water. The first thing to {{discover}} is whether they have a sentinel stationed anywhere {{near the bottom of}} this path." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beshrew my fingers, then, if {{they did}} so," [...] replied the stranger. [...] "I would your whole country lay there, along with you; and Heaven's curse blight the hand that helped to raise them!--Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> my way?" [...] he added, fiercely.|$|E
6000|$|MINNIE. Why wouldn't I {{have a good}} time? That's {{what you}} were having,--a good time with me,--wasn't it? And say, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>stop</b> to think what one day of a working girl's life was like? ...|$|R
6000|$|She stopped, {{remembering that}} the man was a stranger; and then resumed in a {{different}} tone, [...] "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> really <b>stop</b> the hunt? Are you {{one of the people who}} don't believe in sport?" ...|$|R
3000|$|... 7 To {{obtain the}} {{information}} on planned retirement, the HRS makes the following query: “Now I want to ask about your retirement plans. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> plan to <b>stop</b> working altogether or reduce work hours at a particular date or age, have you not given it much thought, or what?” This question is followed by, “At what age <b>do</b> <b>you</b> plan to <b>stop</b> working?” if the respondent plans to stop work altogether. When the respondent has no plans or has not given it much thought, the interviewer asks: “At what age <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> will <b>stop</b> working?” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{one must}} stay behind {{to look after}} our things. The new-comers who camped beside us to-day {{are not used to}} mining life, and don't {{sufficiently}} know the terrors of Lynch law. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop,</b> Maxton. Now then, the rest of you, come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here, lad? Give {{the word}} for gettin' under way, so the {{commodore}} may see {{we know how to}} obey in sailorman fashion, an' if there's any talkin' to be done we'll have plenty of time for tongue waggin' while runnin' down the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop?</b> You {{had almost}} feared that Versailles had been wasted upon me. That I should permit the court-ship {{of me to}} be {{conducted}} like that of any village wench. It was stupid of you. I am being sought in proper form, at my uncle's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try the {{experiment}} of telling her friends. Let them know it's {{a question of}} money, and they will overcome her scruples, if you can't. But {{that is not what}} I had to say to <b>you.</b> How long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> propose <b>stopping</b> here this time?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) {{characterized}} Senator Schumer's questioning {{as of the}} [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> beating your wife?"

Senator Cornyn said that the word [...] "abortion" [...] {{is not in the}} Constitution; Alito said, [...] "The word that appears in the Constitution is liberty." [...] He further claimed that [...] "There is no express reference to privacy in the Constitution.

6000|$|Now who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>stopped</b> at {{the booth}} for {{a chat with}} Miss Jinny? Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?

6000|$|... "Now, Sally, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> {{here and}} take care of Charlie," [...] said Young, leading the little girl to a soft grassy mound, as far back {{from the edge of the}} cliff as possible.

6000|$|... "I shall {{keep them}} from firing the pile as long as I can. The count has two double-barrelled guns. I don't want to use them, if I can help it; but they shall not get in here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop,</b> and help next door. There can be no {{fighting}} here yet for, if they do burn the door, {{it will be a}} long time before they can get in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In other words, a tree {{sticks in}} the mud from year's end to year's end," [...] {{answered}} Treherne. [...] "So <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> in your consulting room from ten to eleven every day.

6000|$|... "Of course; of course. He is an American; that accounts. Still, {{it was the}} Induna; but I can quite {{understand}} that the customs of our cousins across the water differ in these particulars from ours.

5000|$|Vernon {{said that}} for the first few years after {{starting}} standup, he would write letters to his hero Charlie Chaplin, although he never got a reply or any acknowledgement of his letter-writing. After Vernon became famous and was making TV appearances, he eventually stopped writing Chaplin. During an appearance in Las Vegas, management told him that Charlie Chaplin would be in the audience that night; Jackie asked if he could meet Chaplin. He was told that Chaplin was eating dinner right then in the restaurant. Vernon walked up to Chaplin's table, and as he started to introduce himself, Chaplin interrupted him, saying, [...] "Of course, Jackie Vernon. Tell me: why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> writing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Saxton laughed harshly. [...] "Under the circumstances, I {{guess there}} is. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know who's <b>stopping</b> him cutting all the props he wants {{right behind the}} mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} well, young woman," [...] said the Rector, a good deal surprised, and unable to {{conjecture}} whether to impute Jeanie's language to simplicity or impertinence; [...] "this may be all very well--but let me {{bring it to a}} point. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> this young man's mouth, and prevent his communicating to his father and his best friend, an explanation (since he says he has one) of circumstances which seem in themselves not a little suspicious?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is haying time; {{a bright}} day; all is cheerful; the birds sing; men, women, and {{children}} are busy in the field. Up we go, zigzag; it grows steeper and steeper. Now right below me is a field, where men are literally working almost on a perpendicular wall, cutting hay; now we are so high that the houses in the valley look like chips. Here we stand in a place two thousand feet above the valley. There is no shield or screen. The horse stands on the very edge; the guide stops, lets go his bridle, and composedly commences an oration on the scene below. [...] "0, for mercy's sake, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here?"

6000|$|And the Notary {{might ask}} in his turn: [...] "Do {{you believe that}} the Christians either of the Greek or of the Western Church will be damned, {{according}} as the truth may be respecting the procession of the Holy Ghost? or that either the Sacramentary or the Lutheran? or again, the Consubstantiationist, or the Transubstantiationist? If not, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> here? Whence this sudden palsy in the limbs of your charity? Again, does this eternal damnation of the individual depend on the supposed importance of the article denied? Or on the moral state of the individual, on the inward source of this denial? And lastly, who authorized either you, or the pseudo-Athanasius, to interpret Catholic faith by belief, arising out of the apparent predominance of the grounds for, over those against, the truth of the positions asserted; much more, by belief as a mere passive acquiescence of the understanding? Were all damned who died during the period when 'totus fere mundus factus est Arianus', as one of the Fathers admits? Alas! alas! how long will it be ere Christians take the plain middle road between intolerance and indifference, by adopting the literal sense and Scriptural import of heresy, that is, wilful error, or belief originating in some perversion of the will; and of heretics, (for such there are, nay, even orthodox heretics), that is, men wilfully unconscious of their own wilfulness, in their limpet-like adhesion to a favourite tenet?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Newman (along with Holzman) {{responded to}} this ongoing {{controversy}} in a 2003 interview with John Söderlund, editor of New Therapist, in a special issue devoted to mind control. In her introduction to the responses, Holzman claimed that the editor's questions [...] "have that 'When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> beating your wife?' quality":These kinds of attacks are ludicrous {{in the way that}} the charge of being a witch was in centuries past. A cult is a made-up thing for which (like the made-up witch) there is no falsifiability. An entire mythology can thus be created, complete with attributes and activities that cannot be proven or disproven. Indeed, that's the virtue of such made-up things. They paint a picture that holds you captive.|$|R
