This article explores such a moral grievance through a case study of the under- 10  m fishery in Sussex, England, where <b>discarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) {{has become a}} highly charged issue, skippers blaming it on unjust quota allocations. The moral claim to a greater quota allocation is analysed using two conceptions of distributive justice, entitlement and desert. The conclusion reached is that the under- 10  m fleet's entitlement arguments for a higher quota are weaker than their desert arguments, but that entitlement arguments weigh more heavily than desert arguments with government when it allocates quota.

40|$|Much of the {{research}} that concerns the impacts of management measures in the eastern Baltic cod fishery has focused on fish stock rather than understanding fishermen's attitudes towards regulations. Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although {{they are the ones}} whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased <b>discarding</b> <b>of</b> juvenile <b>cod.</b> Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective landings control system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery.

Estimating discard rates from length frequency distributions (LFDs) in commercial catches may complement information from observer trips. The accuracy of estimates depends greatly on careful investigation <b>of</b> the <b>discard</b> variability. Here, the impact of three essential factors was quantified for beam-trawl fisheries in the southern North Sea: (i) market prices, (ii) landings per trip (LPT) limitations, and (iii) selectivity of the commercial fishing gear. Observed discard rates for cod, plaice, sole, and whiting were compared with estimates based on length frequency data, taking account of the variability attributable to LPT limitations and market price. Observed <b>discard</b> estimates <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> and whiting differed significantly from LFD-derived estimates because of highgrading. The results indicate that LFD-derived discard estimates are only reliable if the crucial driving factors are quantified. LFDs can be collected from research vessels or by fishers in partnership with scientists. Based upon many of these LFDs and the discard-variability factors identified in observer programmes, discard rates can be estimated better...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} factors {{affecting}} the mortality <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> Atlantic <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua). Last update: July 16, 2011 Previous {{assessments of the}} Gulf <b>of</b> Maine Atlantic <b>cod</b> (Gadus morhua) stock have included estimates <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> from the commercial and recreational fisheries. These estimates have assumed {{that there was no}} survival <b>of</b> fish <b>discarded</b> at sea. The topic <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> mortality and evaluation of appropriate mortality rates was included as a term of reference for the most recent Gulf <b>of</b> Maine <b>cod</b> assessment (NEFSC, 2012). Ultimately, the assessment concluded “…that the published studies probably overestimated survival, although it was difficult to characterize the extent of the bias. The discard mortality rates to be used in SARC 53 for Gulf <b>of</b> Maine <b>cod</b> are 100 % for all gears. ” There is a growing body of literature suggesting that there may be some survival <b>of</b> fish <b>discarded</b> at sea with the survival contingent on multiple factors including gear type, fish size, depth, season, soak duration and overall handling care. Incorporating the results from experimental studies into absolute estimates of fisheries removals is difficult due to the number of factors, the high degree of interactions effects and the uncertainty in the general population. This paper provides an overview of the scientific literature relevant to the survival <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>cod</b> <b>discarded</b> in the commercial fishery. While recreational catch is an important component of total catches <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> in United States waters, no known information exists on the survival <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> <b>discarded</b> in the recreational fishery...|$|R
40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (<b>discards,</b> bycatch <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives.

40|$|The cod {{stock in}} the Western Baltic Sea is {{assessed}} to be overfished regarding the definitions of the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002. Thus, the European Fisheries Council enforced a multi-annual management plan in 2007. Our medium term simulations over the future 10 years assume similar stock productivity {{as compared with the}} past four decades and indicate that the goals of the management plan can be achieved through TAC and consistent effort regulations. Taking account of the uncertainty in the recruitment patterns, the target average fishing mortality of age groups 3 ¿ 6 years of F = 0. 6 per year as defined in the management plan is indicated to exceed sustainable levels consistent with high long term yields and low risk of depletion. The stipulated constraint of the annual TAC variations of ± 15 % will dominate future fisheries management and implies a high recovery potential of the stock through continued reductions in fishing mortality. The scientific assessment of sustainable levels of exploitation and consideration in the plan is strongly advised, taking account of uncertainties attributed to environmental and biological effects. We recommend our study to be complemented with economic impact assessments including effects on by-catch species, which have been disregarded in this study. It is further demonstrated, that the goals of the management plan can alternatively be achieved by mesh size adaptations. An alternative technical option of mesh size increases to realize the required reductions in fishing mortality provides avoidance <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> undersized fish after a few years by means of improved selectivity, another important element of the Common Fisheries Policy. However, it is emphasized that technical regulations since 1990 failed to affect the by-catch and <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> juvenile <b>cod.</b> In any way, the meaningful implementation of the multiannual management plan through stringent control and enforcement appears critical.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{to operate a}} catch-quota scheme on Dutch commercial fishing vessels was investigated in a pilot study on the commercial fishery on cod (Gadus Morhua). The project started {{at the end of}} 2010 and was fully operational, with five Dutch registered vessels, in 2011. To be able to implement a catch quota management system, monitoring and reporting of the total catches is an essential element. This might be done by using electronic monitoring (EM). The participating vessels received up to 30 % additional cod quota under the condition that all cod caught was recorded (including discards) and being deducted from this quota. To verify catches, each vessel was equipped with an electronic monitoring system, involving closed circuit television (cctv) and monitoring sensors. The basic principle of monitoring the catch-quota scheme was to check, using EM video recordings, whether the entire total catches <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> (i. e. landings and discards) was taken onboard and whether it was fully accounted for by the fishers in their logbooks. EM was used to randomly cross-check the logbooks catch entries with EM footage. The two main objectives of this study are: 1) Evaluate the ability of EM to verify reported cod catches and 2) To explore a possible <b>discard</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> or other changes of fishing behavior under a catch quota regime. Provided that all electronic monitoring equipment is up and running and footage is recorded from the right positions onboard the vessels, then, according to the results of this pilot study, EM is able to verify reported cod catches. However, the results do not demonstrate a reduction <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> nor a behavioral change among participants {{as a response to the}} catch-quota regime. Note that this result is based on a very low sample size only. Results of this study demonstrate the potential of EM as a valuable monitoring and possible enforcement tool that might be used to successfully implement innovative management schemes like a catch-quota regime...|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} climate dependent multispecies {{model for}} stock interactions and harvesting of herring, capelin and cod in the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea region has been developed. The concept presupposes that good recruitment <b>of</b> herring and <b>cod</b> {{is linked to}} warm ocean climate, which may occur with frequencies of 8 to 10 years. Strong herring year classes overlap the distribution of capelin larvae in 3 - 4 years causing mass mortality of the capelin fry, and depletion of the capelin stock. At that time the herring is about to leave the Barents Sea, and lack of food in subsequent years reduces the potential yield <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> Immature cod is the main predator on mature capelin and cannibalism {{is an important factor}} in reducing the abundance <b>of</b> juvenile <b>cod</b> when the capelin stock is rebuilding. The model is used in a study of the effects of different fishery management strategies on stocks and yield. Results show that optimum yield <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> is obtained by high fishing mortality on immature cod from the end of a warm period until the spawning stock of capelin is rebuilt In subsequent years the fishing mortality should be reduced until a new warm period occur. This harvesting strategy <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> gives an optimum biomass production of capelin and an optimum potential yield <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> for a spawning stock limit of 200 thousand tonnes. The results are in accordance with the catch history <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> Prior to the 1970 's, the effort of the fishery in the Barents Sea followed to a large extent the abundance <b>of</b> immature <b>cod,</b> resulting in large catches when the stock was abundant.

Each of these species is modeled as conventional single specie models, where the specie interactions {{are related to the}} climate, and taken care of as mortality (predation) and food (growth) related to availability of prey. The model is coded and implemented by use of the dynamic simulation tool "Powersim' 7 Studio 7 ", and the parameters are determined by tuning against relevant data from the period 1982 to 2005. The model simulates reasonably well the observed coherence between climate, fish stocks and catches in the actual period. The capeliu is the most important feed for the cod. The most important specie interactions conceming the yield <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> is the influence of immature herring on the recruitment of capelin and the predation <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> <b>of</b> mature capelin and its own cod fry. Strong age groups of herring reduce the recruitment of capelin which reduce the growth <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> and delays the maturation <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> Declining availability <b>of</b> capelin increases the cannibalism <b>of</b> <b>cod,</b> depending on the volume of recruits {{and the size of the}} older age groups <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> These relations, in combination with climate variability and changes, are determinant for the dynamics of the system.
