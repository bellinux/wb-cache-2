MATERIAL AND METHODS: 4 D CT of a sphere inside a dynamic thorax phantom was acquired. The 4 D CT was reconstructed according to the phase- and amplitude-sorting algorithms. The phantom was moved by reproducing amplitude, frequency, and a mix of amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>variations.</b> Artefact analysis was performed for Mid-Ventilation and ITV-based strategies on the images reconstructed by phase- and amplitude-sorting algorithms. The target volume deviation was assessed by comparing the target volume acquired during irregular motion to the volume acquired during regular motion. RESULTS: The amplitude-sorting algorithm shows reduced artefacts for only amplitude variations while the phase-sorting algorithm for only <b>frequency</b> <b>variations.</b> For amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>variations,</b> both algorithms perform similarly. Most of the artefacts are blurring and incomplete structures. We found larger artefacts and volume differences for the Mid-Ventilation with respect to the ITV strategy, resulting in a higher relative difference of the surface distortion value which ranges between maximum 14. 6 % and minimum 4. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: The amplitude- is superior to the phase-sorting algorithm in the reduction of motion artefacts for amplitude variations while phase-sorting for <b>frequency</b> <b>variations.</b> A proper choice of 4 D CT sorting algorithm is important in order to reduce motion artefacts, especially if Mid-Ventilation strategy is used...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} most successful approach for power-line (PL) interference removal from ECG, called subtraction procedure, is based on linear segment detection in the signal and hardware synchronised analogue-to-digital conversion to cope with the PL <b>frequency</b> <b>variations.</b> However, this is not feasible for battery supplied devices and some computer-aided ECG systems. Recent improvements of the procedure apply software measurement of the <b>frequency</b> <b>variations</b> that allow a re-sampling of the contaminated signal with the rated PL frequency followed by interference removal and back re-sampling for restoration of the original time intervals. This study deals with a more accurate software frequency measurement and introduces a notch filtration as alternative to the procedure when no linear segments are encountered for long time, e. g. in cases of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia. The result obtained with large PL <b>frequency</b> <b>variations</b> demonstrate very small errors, usually in the range of ± 20 μV for the subtraction procedure and ± 60 μV for the notch filtration, the last values strongly depending on the frequency contents of the QRS complexes...|$|R

An important factor for humans and animals to detect in order to survive is the idea of involvement which can be indicated through change and intensity (Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Vocal characteristics such as amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>variation</b> indicate change while speech rate can indicate intensity (Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Those with a high speech rate talk faster and as such are usually perceived as more dominant (Aronvitch; Buller and Aune; Buller and Burgoon; Harrigan et al..; Scherer et al.., as cited in Tusing and Dillard, 2000). Interruptions, vocal control, loudness, pitch, verbosity, speech rate and message length were found to predict perceptions of dominance.|$|E
