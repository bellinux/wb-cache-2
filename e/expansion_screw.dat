It usually takes {{a week or two}} for one to adjust to eating and speaking after first receiving the rapid palatal expander. This process requires patients to turn the <b>expansion</b> <b>screw</b> themselves to tighten up the expander.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} {{experiments}} were to study bone reactions at implants (i) with different surface topography, and (ii) subjected to static lateral loads of different magnitude, duration and with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. In study I, 120 implants were inserted in the tibia of 12 rabbits. Removal torque tests (RMT) were performed after 4, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Ground sections of the "bone bed" were prepared for histological analysis. In studies II-V a dog model was used. Three months after extraction of mandibular premolars, implants with different surface topography were inserted in the bone. Crowns connected in pairs with orthodontic <b>expansion</b> <b>screws,</b> were fitted 12 weeks later to the implants. A static lateral load was induced by <b>expansion</b> <b>screws.</b> In study II, 4 different degrees of expansion were examined, while in study III the bone reactions to load at implants with turned and titanium-plasma-sprayed (TPS) surfaces were evaluated. In study IV the influence of duration of the lateral static load was analyzed and in study V peri-implantitis with or without static load, was investigated. It was found that an increased surface roughness resulted in an increased implant anchorage assessed by RMT (Study I). Laterally loaded implants exhibited a higher peri-implant bone density and a larger fraction of mineralized bone-to-implant contact than implants not exposed to lateral load (Study II). The values describing (i) marginal bone level, (ii) amount of bone-to-implant contact at the bone/implant interface and (iii) peri-implant bone density following 24 weeks of static lateral load were larger at implant sites with a TPS surface than at sites with a turned surface (Study III). It was also demonstrated that sites subjected to 10 or 46 weeks of lateral load had similar (i) distribution of bone labels, (ii) peri-implant bone density and (iii) amount of bone-to-implant contact (Study IV). The peri-implant bone density {{and the amount of}} mineralized bone-to-implant contact fraction were larger in the interface zone than in zones 1 to 2 mm lateral of the implant surface (Study II-V).

30|$|Expansion arches cost {{substantially}} less than distraction osteogenesis appliances. The four-point fixation of the <b>expansion</b> <b>screw</b> can provide sufficient guidance stability {{for the two}} halves of the maxilla during expansion.

This technique is contraindicated in patients in whom the palatal vault is too low, potentially leading to root tip injury and sinus perforation after screw insertion.|$|E
40|$|Expansive pedicle screws {{significantly}} improve fixation {{strength in}} osteoporotic spines. However, the previous literature does not adequately address {{the effects of}} the number of lengthwise slits and the extent of <b>screw</b> <b>expansion</b> on the strength of the bone/screw inter-face when expansive screws are used with or without cement augmentation. Herein, four designs for expansive pedicle screws with different numbers of lengthwise slits and different <b>screw</b> <b>expansion</b> levels were evaluated. Synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a comparative platform for each screw design. The prepared speci-mens were then tested for axial pullout failure. Regardless of screw design, screws with cement augmentation demonstrated significantly higher pullout strength than pedicle screws without cement augmentation (p 0. 05). Taken together, our results show that pedicle screws combined with cement augmentation may greatly increase screw fixation regardless of screws with or without expansion. An increase in both the number of slits and the extent of <b>screw</b> <b>expansion</b> had little impact on the screw-anchoring strength. Cement augmentation is the most influential factor for improving screw pullout strength...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: An {{appliance}} {{to correct}} unilateral Class II molar relationship was described, the clinical and laboratory {{procedures for the}} construction of the appliance was explained. The clinical application for the unilateral molar distalization was illustrated by a case report. Other methods of distalization were reviewed and compared with the present appliance. The advantages and disadvantages of the appliance were presented. Method and Materials: The appliance is attached to the maxillary dentition through the bands of the maxillary molars and premolars. The anchor molar and premolar bands are connected to each other by 0. 9 mm stainless steel wire that was soldered to the lingual surface of the bands. The wire from the anchor teeth was then soldered to the wire of the <b>expansion</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>expansion</b> <b>screw</b> was also soldered to the molar band that need distalization. An acrylic button was added to the wire crossing the palatal slope above the rougae for more anchorage Results: The clinical application showed a unilateral class II molar and canine relationships were corrected by the appliance. The posttreatment panoramic radiograoph showed that the roots of the teeth were fairly parallel, and the maxillary left lateral incisor was positioned into the arch. The supporting tissues appeared healthy. The postreatment cephalometric radiograph and superimposed tracing showed no significant changes in the skeletal measurements after treatment, as expected, with no orthopedic treatment.

For the evaluation of mechanical properties, the screws for RME were adjusted using the same maxillary dental model. An Instron 3365 testing machine with a load cell of 5 kN recorded the forces released by the screws at different amounts of activation (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 quarters of a turn). Each type of screw was tested 10 times. Comparisons between the forces released by the different types of screws at different amounts of activation were carried out by means of analysis of Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc test di Tukey (P < 0. 05). Results: The results of this study showed that all 3 expansion devices were able to develop forces that could produce a separation of the palatine processes. The Hyrax and A 2620 expanders developed force values over 20 kg and the Palatal Split screws about 16 kg.

Foil thickness and heat behavior, strain values, using special strain gauges and esthetics were taken into account. A 4 week recall was scheduled in order to observe the treatment progress regarding PETG appliances. Measurements were performed to determine to optimal foil thickness. RESULTS Dental alignment and expansion were observed in all cases. Regarding behavior to heat, the 1 mm foil presented only a small reduction in thickness compared to other foils and the strain values seem to be higher for the thinner aligners.

OBJECTIVE: This study describes the clinical case of monozygotic twins with unilateral cleft lip and palate {{at the age of}} mixed dentition, who were treated using the same rapid maxillary expansion protocol, but with two different screws (conventional and fan-type <b>expansion</b> <b>screw).</b> Results were evaluated using plaster models, intraoral and extraoral photographs, and Cone-Beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans obtained before the beginning of the treatment, (T 1). METHODS: The patients were followed up for 6 months after maxillary expansion, when the same tests requested at T 1 were obtained again for review (T 2). T 1 and T 2 results were compared using lateral cephalometric tracings and measurements of the intercanine and intermolar distances in the plaster models using a digital caliper. RESULTS: The two types of expansion screws corrected the transverse discrepancy in patients with cleft lip and palate. The shape of the upper arches improved at 10 days after activation. CONCLUSION: CBCT scans provide detailed information about craniofacial, maxillary and mandibular changes resulting from rapid maxillary expansion.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the evidence on}} three-dimensional immediate effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) treatment on growing patients as assessed by computed tomography/cone beam computed tomography (CT/CBCT) imaging. Materials and Methods: The published literature was searched through the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library electronic databases from January 1966 to December 2012. The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized controlled trials, prospective controlled studies, and prospective case-series. Two reviewers extracted the data independently and assessed {{the quality of the}} studies. Results: The search strategy resulted in 73 abstracts or full-text articles, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. When treating posterior crossbites with a RME device, the existing evidence points out that the midpalatal suture opening is around 20 %- 50 % of the total <b>screw</b> <b>expansion.</b> There seems to be no consistent evidence on whether the midpalatal sutural opening is parallel or triangular. The effect on the nasal cavity dimensions after RME seems to be apparent and indicates an enlargement between 17 % and 33 % of the total <b>screw</b> <b>expansion.</b> Circummaxillary sutures, particularly the zygomaticomaxillary and frontomaxillary sutures and also spheno-occipital synchondrosis, appear to be affected by the maxillary expansion. Overall, however, the changes were small and the evidence not conclusive. Conclusions: CT imaging proved to be a useful tool for assessment of treatment effects in all three dimensions.

The optical drive, however, can be accessed far more easily, requiring only 11 screws and one standoff to be removed. Later on, some users transplanted a 1024&times;768 LCD from the more recent white iBook into a clamshell iBook. This is only possible with the [...] "FireWire" [...] and [...] "FireWire SE" [...] models, as they have 8 MB of video RAM; the older ones only have 4 MB.|$|R
