5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina is a U.S. state {{located on}} the Atlantic Seaboard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Tropical cyclones—storms {{characterized}} by a large low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state. According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5% of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones have affected the state.|$|E

The eight-floor structure was built over, through, and around the original three-story library while it was still in use.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} widespread rainfall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{accompanied by}} gale-force winds along the coast, and ships reported severe conditions at sea. High tides occurred around St. Augustine, Florida, washing over the South Street Causeway. Winds {{from the storm}} dispersed large amounts of dead grass from marshes in the area. No significant damage was reported due to thorough warnings before the cyclone. A 2005 reanalysis of the storm made some minor changes to its listing in the official hurricane database, setting back the time of formation and raising the peak intensity.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} hurricane warnings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, resulting in the evacuation of tourists on Labor Day Weekend. Able produced heavy rainfall from Florida through New England, which caused widespread flooding. The city struck by the hurricane was heavily damaged and briefly isolated due to downed power and telephone lines. Overall damage in the United States totaled $2.75million (1952USD, $ USD), mostly from crop damage in South Carolina. Further north, Able produced flooding and gusty winds, which washed out {{a portion of the}} Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians {{are found}} mainly in {{lowlands}} in the tropics, but alligators also live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States and the Yangtze River in China. They are largely carnivorous, the various species feeding on {{animals such as}} fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, and mammals; some species like the Indian gharial are specialised feeders, while others like the saltwater crocodile have generalised diets. Crocodilians are typically solitary and territorial, though cooperative feeding does occur. During breeding, dominant males try to monopolise available females. Females lay eggs in holes or in mounds and, unlike most other reptiles, care for their hatched young.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{from the}} remnant {{low-pressure}} area of Bonnie led to heavy rains {{in several states}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Rainfall was generally minor in most areas, however in Arkansas, rains totaled up to 11.75in (254mm) at the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Several roads were washed out in Ouachita County near Elliott. A number of roads and bridges were also washed out in Union County, with damage totaling $200,000. U.S. Route 79 was closed between Magnolia and Stephens because of standing water. Three or four families evacuated near the Ouachita-Union County line after the Smackover Creek overflowed its banks and flooded 20homes. There was also a small area of heavy rains totaling up to 5in (127mm) along the border of Tennessee and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that women pretend orgasm {{as part of a}} broader strategy of mate retention. We obtained self-report data from 453 heterosexual women (mean age 21. 8 years) in a long-term relationship (mean length 32. 8 months) drawn from universities and surrounding communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>Unites</b> States. <b>The</b> results indicated that (1) women who perceived higher risk of partner infidelity were more likely to report pretending orgasm, (2) women who reported greater likelihood of pretending orgasm also reported performing more mate retention behaviors, and (3) women’s perceptions of partner infidelity risk mediated the relationship between pretending orgasm and the performance of cost-inflicting mate retention behaviors, such as Intersexual Negative Inducements (“Flirted with someone in front of my partner”) and Intrasexual Negative Inducements (“Yelled at a woman who looked at my partner”). Thus, pretending orgasm may be part of a broader strategy of mate retention performed by women who perceive higher risk of partner infidelity. Key words: pretending orgasm, infidelity risk, mate retention...|$|R
