The base {{experimental}} conditions for {{these factors are}} 900  °C, 10  wt% and 1.3 respectively. When {{one of the factors}} is investigated, the rest remains unchanged. The variation range of bed temperature is from 780 to 950  °C. The MSW blend ratio is from 0 to 30  wt% and the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> is from 1.2 to 1.8.

40|$|International audienceIn {{wood chip}} boilers, CO {{emissions}} {{can be reduced}} by improving the control over the combustion process. To minimize emissions and optimize efficiency, the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> the primary and secondary air distribution systems, and the fuel feed rates must be adjusted to maintain stable combustion. An extensive series of wood combustion tests was performed in a grate automatic 180 kWth boiler. The level of influence exerted by wood parameters, such as the origin, particle size, and moisture content, and combustion parameters, such as the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> air distribution, and boiler load, were studied. The most important characteristic of wood with regard to CO emissions is the moisture content. The combustion tests with both types of wood chips and sawdust show that the CO emissions and <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> decline when the fuel power increases. The direct relationship between the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> {{and the level of}} power facilitates the optimization that minimizes the CO emissions. The control system must be based on a fluctuating O- 2 concentration in the exhaust gas by varying the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> relative to the power demand. The <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> needed to implement the optimal conditions should be between 2. 0 and 2. 5 at 100 kWth, between 1. 9 and 2. 1 at 135 kWth, and between 1. 7 and 1. 9 at nominal power...|$|E
40|$|During the {{operation}} of certain older types of annular shaft kilns used for lime burning, one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio.</b> Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio,</b> the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> {{during the process of}} lime burning in an annular shaft kiln are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for lime burning is reduced...|$|R

It is clarified by analysis of the two-zone model that the large reduction in NO_x due to timing retard is mainly caused by decreases in both combustion temperature and combustion pressure, and the small reduction in NO_x occurring when the nozzle-hole diameter is decreased, is due to a small decrease in combustion pressure resulting from a decrease in the heat release rate during premixed combustion...|$|E

These additives convert KCl to an alkali sulphate and a more efficient sulphation is normally achieved for ammonium sulphate compared to sulphur. The presence of SO 3 is thus of greater importance than that of SO 2. Oxygen and volatile combustibles could also {{have an effect on the}} sulphation of gaseous KCl. This paper is based on results obtained during co-combustion of wood chips and straw pellets in a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. Ammonium sulphate was injected at three positions in the boiler i. e. in the upper part of the combustion chamber, in the cyclone inlet, and in the cyclone. The sulphation of KCl was investigated at three <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratios</b> (lambda = 1. 1, 1. 2 and 1. 4). Several measurement tools were applied including IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous alkali chlorides), deposit probes (chemical composition in deposits collected) and gas analysis. The position for injection of ammonium sulphate had a great impact on the sulphation efficiency for gaseous KCl at the different <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratios.</b> There was also an effect of oxygen on the sulphation efficiency when injecting ammonium sulphate in the cyclone.

40|$|Biomass boiler houses {{face some}} typical {{problems}} and a task {{of this work}} is to recognize these problems, {{to find out the}} causes and solutions how to decrease its influence for boiler house operation. Main tasks of the first tests were to perform operating parameters measurements when feeding furnace with average moisture content fuel and dry fuel, to calculate boiler efficiency and to analyze boiler behavior combusting various moisture content fuel. Different grate movements cycles ratio values was noticed. This ration influence in fuel layer thickness on grate, and the higher the ratio, the thicker fuel layer is. Primary air pressure dependence on fuel layer thickness confirms this statement. Different movement of first and second grate part causes fuel layer to fracture. As fuel moisture increases, grate movements cycles ratio should be increased as well. Biomass combustion from bottom to top was noticed. Thin hot coal layer covers the grate and primary air works as catalyst. Hot flue gas dries wet fuel as it flows thru it. Possibilities to improve combustion process were determined. Increasing primary air amount would speed up fuel drying process. Combustion air-preheating acts as catalyst not only for drying, but also for ignition and intensification of combustion process. Recirculation flue gas flow will dry fuel more quickly if it will not be mixed with primary air. Mixing hot flue gas with cold air, mixture temperature drops below water vapor saturation temperature and excess moisture condensates. Increasing grate movements cycle’s ratio improves combustion of wet fuel, however primary air flows has to be redistributed as well. There was no need to change any settings to combust biomass with 54 % moisture content, existing regime card was enough. Feeding wet fuel causes boiler water outlet temperature to decrease, i. e. boiler load decreases. In order to increase boiler load, fuel feeding was increased manually. After increasing fuel amount, secondary and tertiary air fans speed increased automatically, causing higher <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio.</b> Tertiary <b>air</b> set value was decreased manually to maintain lower <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio.</b> Combustion process has stabilized after increasing primary air first and second fan load and decreasing third primary air fan load. Wet fuel contained high amount of conifers spikes, which has ~ 1, 8 % fuel nitrogen content, therefore higher nitrogen oxides emissions were measured. Fuel moisture content has a highest influence for thermal capacity of flue gas condensing economizer, moreover the higher moisture content is the more significant effect on economizer capacity it has. Flue gas temperature after economizer and <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> also has significant effect. To increase flue gas condensing economizer efficiency, <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> must be kept as low as possible.

40|$|Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) {{is one of}} the {{principal}} techniques used to control spark ignition NO X. A fraction of the exhaust gas is recycled through a control valve from the exhaust to the engine intake system. However, EGR has different effect on performance, combustion and emissions production that are difficult to distinguish such as increase of intake temperature, delay of Rate Of Heat Rrelease (ROHR), decrease of peak heat release, decrease in oxygen concentration etc. Therefore the impact of EGR on the aforementioned engine parameters (i. e., performance, combustion and exhaust emission) is not perfectly understood, especially under high EGR rates. An experimental study has been conducted to analyze various effects of EGR rates on the performance and emissions of the stratified charge piston direct injection compressed natural gas engine and to determine the stable operating limit of the engine at different <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratios</b> (= 0. 9, 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2) which represents rich, stoichiometric, slightly lean and moderately lean mixture respectively. The results showed that as the EGR is increased, the brake torque, brake specific fuel consumption decreased, while nitric oxide emissions (NO) reduced drastically at various fraction of EGR, just as Unburnt Hydro Carbon (UHC) increased. EGR has no significant effect on carbon monoxide (CO) emission. The addition of EGR also reduces cylinder’s gas temperature and pressure. It can be concluded that in introducing EGR in DI-CNG engines, there is a tradeoff between the engine’s performance and NO X emission, while it is difficult to realize stable combustion at high temperature...|$|R

The greatest popularity on the market gained engines of Volkswagen Company, named FSI and TFSI / TSI. Application of Common Rail systems allowed not only improving {{the characteristics of the}} engine by increasing the accuracy in dispensing fuel into individual cylinders. The most important gain is the possibility of second injection of the fuel to the cylinder after the intake valve is closed.

On the other hand it allows creating a stratified mixture, at low load of the engine it reduces fuel consumption and work at high <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratios</b> Ȝ.

On the one hand, you can replace engines naturally aspirated, with turbocharged with lower displacement, which leads to the improvement of the economics of such engine. On the other hand, after appropriate modifications to the design, you can add a charger to the naturally aspirated engine, retaining its capacity. Gains are then not only higher operating parameters, such as power and torque, but it also significantly improves the torque curve. It has big impact on the flexibility of the engine and th...|$|R
40|$|CFD {{analysis}} of {{heavy fuel oil}} combustion in a 6. 7 MW cylindrical vertically-red furnace has been carried out. The furnace supplies process heat in the Oil renery of the National oil company (INA) in Rijeka-Croatia. The motivation of the work was to improve {{the performance of the}} combustion process by changing fuel and burner parameters. The commercial CFD-code Fluent is used to model transport and reaction in the furnace. The chosen CFD models for heavy fuel oil spray combustion are compared with measurement data found in the literature and good agreement is achieved. The combustion process is investigated through the inuence of different parameters: <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio,</b> fuel oil droplet diameter, spray cone half-angle and burner swirl number. It is determined that the best performance of the combustion process is achieved for an <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 15. The droplet diameter should be neither too small nor too large: medium-sized droplets (~ 100 μm) mix well with air and reside in the furnace the right amount of time for complete burnout to occur. Small spray cone half-angles deteriorate mixing between air and fuel which is reected i...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:Helmholtz-type valveless {{self-excited}} pulse combustor; frequency characteristics; pressure characteristics; pulse combustion; {{theoretical model}} Abstract. The frequency and pressure {{characteristics of a}} Helmholtz-type valveless self-excited pulse combustor with continuous supply of fuel and air are investigated in this paper. A theoretical model of combustion is established. In the model, combustion is assumed {{to take place in}} a thin flame sheet separating the two zones, and the effects of the continuous gas-supply mode and heat transfer of the tailpipe on the operating characteristics are considered. From the mathematical model, the expressions of frequency and maximum pressure amplitude for the pulse combustor are derived. The results suggest that the frequency decreases with the increase of <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> and tailpipe length, and increases with the heat load. The pressure amplitude increases with the increase of the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> and heat load, and slightly declines with the increase of the tailpipe length. The experimental data show qualitative agreement with the calculated results...|$|E
40|$|A well-designed CFB {{combustor}} {{can burn}} coal with high efficiency and within acceptable levels of gaseous emission. In this study, the combustion efficiency of CFB combustor {{based on the}} losses has been defined and effects of operational parameters on combustion efficiency have been investigated by a dynamic 2 D model which has been developed in our previous studies. Investigations on combustion efficiency are carried out using the model {{to examine the effects}} of different operational parameters and coal properties on bed temperature and the overall CO, NOx and SO 2 emissions from pilot-scale CFB combustor. Investigations on combustion efficiency are carried out for a pilot-scale CFB combustor. The combustion efficiency changes between 53 and 80 % for various excess air ratios used in this study. By increasing <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> combustion efficiency decreases. Coal particle diameter value has more significant effect on combustion efficiency than to inlet bed pressure value for pilot-scale CFB combustor as <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. The present study also proves that CFB combustion allows clean and efficient combustion of coal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{ignition}} advance angle and <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> on the combustion and emissions characteristics were investigated on a CNG engine at idle conditions. The throttle valve was fully closed. When the parameters were changed, the stepper motor was adjusted automatically {{to control the}} engine speed at 800 r/min. When the θi is changed from 40 to 10 o BTDC, the maximum ITE and the maximum power are observed at λ= 1. 1. As λ increases, the maximum ITE is corresponding to a greater θi. The COVimep will be increased if the θi is too advanced or too small. When λ is more than 1. 3, the COVimep increases obviously. When λ= 1. 1, NOx emissions get the highest level.

40|$|Development of the {{swirling}} flame dynamics at thermo chemical conversion of biomass (wood pellets) {{has been investigated}} experimentally at a low swirl number of {{the swirling}} flame flow (S 1) is used to provide mixing of the axial flow of volatiles with an air swirl and to support the combustion of volatiles {{with the formation of}} a downstream reaction zone. It is shown that the development of combustion dynamics is influenced by the competitive processes of endothermic thermal decomposition of biomass and exothermal combustion of volatiles. The enhanced thermal decomposition of biomass by increasing the primary air supply and the axial flow of volatiles results in an intensive heat energy consumption with a correlating increase of the <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> {{at the bottom of the}} combustor and in ignition delay. This determines the incomplete combustion of the volatiles at the primary stage of flame formation and restricts the development of combustion dynamics. The combustion conditions can be improved by decreasing the secondary air supply and <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratio</b> at the bottom of the combustor, which leads to enhanced ignition with a faster and more complete combustion of volatiles...|$|R

Polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, kitchen waste, paper, textile, etc. were chosen to simulate the MSW. The effects of temperature, air staging, and moisture on the CO formation and emissions were analysed for both the grate drying bed combustion and the CFB combustion. In the grate drying bed, the low temperatures increased the carbon to CO conversion rate which also increased slightly with the moisture content. Industrial field tests in a commercial grate–CFB incinerator showed that the CO concentration at the grate drying bed exit was very high and decreased along furnace height. The carbon to CO conversion rates were 0 – 20 % for the grate drying bed which exceeded the range of 0. 8 – 16 % measured in a grate drying bed exit of the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests. In the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests, at <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from 1. 5 – 2. 0 or more, the CO emissions decreased to a low and stable level, whose corresponding carbon to CO conversion rates were far lower than 0 – 10 %. The low CO emission {{is one of the}} factors enabling the polychlorinated dibenzodioxin/polychlorinated diben-zofuran emissions to satisfy the Chinese national regulations...|$|R
40|$|Sulphate {{containing}} additives, such as {{ammonium sulphate}} (AS, (NH 4) 2 SO 4), {{are used for}} sulphation of KCl during biomass combustion. Another aspect with injection of AS is that a significant NOx reduction is achieved {{but it may also}} have an impact on other flue gas components such as CO. The concentration of oxygen and the presence volatile combustibles could also {{have an effect on the}} flue gas chemistry involving KCl, NO and CO. This paper is based on results obtained from two measurement campaigns during co-combustion of wood chips and straw pellets in a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. In the first campaign, the NO reduction performance of AS, ammonia and urea was compared. In the second one, AS was injected at three positions in the boiler i. e. in the upper part of the combustion chamber, in the cyclone inlet, and in the cyclone. The impact of AS on the flue gas chemistry was investigated at three <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratios</b> (λ= 1. 1, 1. 2 and 1. 4). Several measurement tools including, IACM (on-line measurements of gaseous alkali chlorides) and gas analysis were applied. The position for injection of AS as well as the different <b>air</b> <b>excess</b> <b>ratios</b> had a great impact on the flue gas chemistry for especially KCl and NO...|$|R
