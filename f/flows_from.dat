5|$|Lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} {{in complex}} layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, {{all of which}} have lava flows; the last one also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of the cone was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Licancabur and <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Sairecabur. <b>Flows</b> <b>from</b> both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E

5|$|According to beliefs {{derived from}} fusui (feng shui), the fox's power over evil {{is such that}} a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil kimon, or energy, that <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, feature such statues, {{sometimes}} large numbers of them.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the northeastern}} {{portion of the}} {{peninsula}} is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers {{are located in the}} south. The Sibun River <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the Río Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The Río Nuevo <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest of the peninsula, the San Pedro River, the Candelaría River and the Mamantel River, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.|$|E
5|$|Older {{volcanic}} centres extend {{northwest of}} Ciomadul. With increasing distance they are 2.5–1.5 {{million years old}} Pilisca centre, the 2.8–2.2 million years old Cucu centre and the 4.3–3.6 million years old Luci-Lazu and Sumuleu-Ciuc volcanic centres. South of Ciomadul the Murgul shoshonites were erupted 2.3–1.5 million years ago; they represent cryptodomes. Andesite lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Pilisca underlie the Ciomadul deposits in some places.|$|E

60|$|So {{then the}} Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards the Point q {{found by the}} {{foregoing}} Rules. And if the incident Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards several points Q, the reflected or refracted Rays shall <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards so many other Points q found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> or towards the Point q is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point {{be on the same}} side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point q and the refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the reflected <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> q, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary happens when q is on the other side of the Surface.|$|R

The Pirron Yaloak has high {{nutrient}} loads due to dairy farming in its catchment.|$|R
5|$|Pyroclastic <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> an {{eruption}} would destroy much wildlife about the volcano. Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi Volcano could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could fall into the ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is largely}} {{missing from the}} Puna plateau {{in the area of}} Tuzgle, which has {{facilitated}} the mapping of lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Cerro Tuzgle. A steppe-like vegetation dominated by herbs grows on the slopes of Tuzgle, containing taxa like Festuca, Poa and Stipa as elsewhere on the Puna.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> the two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|E

50|$|A {{principal}} {{feature of}} the Chicago Portage water gap is that water can flow through it in either direction across the continental divide. It has <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> east to west, west to east, or not at all. There have been two long-term reversals, and short-term reversals still happen today. Initially, water <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> east to west starting about 10,000 years ago. About 3,000 years ago, this flow mostly stopped, and the Chicago Portage became a wind gap, except during floods when it <b>flowed</b> <b>from</b> west to east. In the year 1900, it was reversed to again <b>flow</b> continuously <b>from</b> east to west, except during floods when it can be reversed to <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> west to east.|$|R
50|$|The glacier {{gives rise}} to the Shigar River, which is a {{tributary}} of the Indus River. Several large tributary glaciers feed the main Baltoro Glacier, including the Godwin Austen Glacier, <b>flowing</b> south <b>from</b> K2; the Abruzzi and the various Gasherbrum Glaciers, <b>flowing</b> <b>from</b> the Gasherbrum group of peaks; the Vigne Glacier, <b>flowing</b> <b>from</b> Chogolisa, and the Yermandendu Glacier, <b>flowing</b> <b>from</b> Masherbrum. The confluence of the main Baltoro Glacier with the Godwin Austen Glacier is known as Concordia; this location and K2 base camp are popular trekking destinations.|$|R
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{is part of}} a {{limestone}} area {{running from}} the Mendip Hills in the south to the Cotswolds in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome cut through the limestone to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} {{had begun to}} take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|Gareloi is {{the northernmost}} volcano of the Delarof Group, a {{subgroup}} of the Aleutian Islands. It {{is composed of}} two craters, the older of which is covered by lava flows running to the northwest and southern coasts. The northern crater is small, with a feature suggesting dome collapse in its northwest flank. The southern flank, higher up and considerably larger, contains fumarolic activity. A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into the older caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> the volcano.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted {{as a challenge to}} the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> one side of the heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E

5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene flows. Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene flows to Sweden. Except for gene flows originating from France, and some limited gene flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava <b>flows</b> <b>from</b> summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows and debris avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E
50|$|The river has a karst character. It {{receives}} much of {{its water}} through subterranean <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the Reka River (Slovenia), but tracer {{studies have shown that}} other sinking rivers, Vipava, Soča, and Raša also contribute. From modelling results, the Timavo is believed to receive one third of its <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> the Reka and two-thirds of its <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> infiltration of precipitation into the Karst Plateau, {{and to a lesser extent}} from the other sinking river sources.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} modes of breathing, viz, <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> left nostril, <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> right nostril & <b>flow</b> <b>from</b> both the nostrils. The last mode is {{generally}} {{for a short}} duration when breathing switches {{from left to right}} & vice versa. Mode of breathing can be checked by examining air flow while exhaling. All our actions can be classified into three main categories; physical, mental and spiritual; which are respectively presided by the above three modes of breathing.|$|R
