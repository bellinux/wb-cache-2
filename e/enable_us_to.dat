25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals {{is that we}} are not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs that would <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E

25|$|About {{governance}} : Two approaches shall <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{tackle the}} problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions {{the efficiency of the}} systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher education will succeed only if it allows creating a common space of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.|$|E
25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> pass {{beyond the limits}} of the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

500|$|Tony {{left the}} soap on 12 December 2008, after his true nature was exposed. It was {{announced}} on 7 September 2009 {{that he would}} return to EastEnders to be put on trial. Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse."

500|$|Other critics {{offered a}} more {{positive}} impression of the piece. The Examiner celebrated Etty's having [...] "outdone his former self, {{and most of his}} contemporaries". A reviewer in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction said that [...] "few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production," [...] describing the figures as [...] "graceful and elegant". The Athenaeum thought it [...] "decidedly the most attractive picture in the whole Exhibition", noting that their review was delayed because in the opening week of the exhibition, [...] "the crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to get such a view of it as would <b>enable</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do it justice". Colburn's New Monthly Magazine considered it [...] "another instance of the rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection." [...] The most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by [...] John Taylor, who in September 1828 imagined that if Milton and Nicolas Poussin were both alive to see the painting, Milton would view it with [...] "proud delight", while Poussin would suffer an [...] "envious thorn" [...] with the realization that Etty's abilities had surpassed his own.|$|E
