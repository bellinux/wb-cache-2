40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work was the development of micro combustion calorimetry apparatus and methods to study organic compounds. A micro rotating bomb combustion calorimeter requiring only 10 mg to 30 mg samples for a precise determination of the energies of combustion of solid organic compounds was developed. The accuracy of the apparatus was tested by determining the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid in the crystalline state at 298. 15 K (Chapter 2). An attempt was made, to adapt the gravimetric method of carbon dioxide analysis, {{used to assess the}} completeness of the combustion reactions in macro combustion reactions in macro combustion calorimetry to the micro scale. This work required the design and construction of a new micro combustion bomb with two inlet valves, that can be adapted to the calorimetric apparatus referred to above and a CO_ 2 absorption line. Tests made with benzoic acid indicate that the procedure used in this Thesis needs improvement (Chapter 2). An apparatus for the determination of enthalpies of sublimation by the Knudsen <b>effusion</b> <b>method,</b> previously developed at the Instituto Superior Tecnico Thermochemistry Laboratory, was modified to extend the temperature range of the measurements up to ca. 500 K (Chapter 2).

40|$|Coupling the Knudsen <b>effusion</b> <b>method</b> {{with mass}} {{spectrometry}} {{has proven to}} be one of the most useful experimental techniques for studying the equilibrium between condensed phases and complex vapors. The Knudsen <b>effusion</b> <b>method</b> involves placing a condensed sample in a Knudsen cell, a small "enclosure", that is uniformly heated and held until equilibrium is attained between the condensed and vapor phases. The vapor is continuously sampled by effusion through a small orifice in the cell. A molecular beam is formed from the effusing vapor and directed into a mass spectrometer for identification and pressure measurement of the species in the vapor phase. Knudsen cell mass spectrometry (KCMS) has been used for nearly fifty years now and continues to be a leading technique for obtaining thermodynamic data. Indeed, much of the well-established vapor specie data in the JANAF tables has been obtained from this technique. This is due to the extreme versatility of the technique. All classes of materials can be studied and all constituents of the vapor phase can be measured over a wide range of pressures (approximately 10 (exp - 4) to 10 (exp - 11) bar) and temperatures (500 - 2800 K). The ability to selectively measure different vapor species makes KCMS a very powerful tool for the measurement of component activities in metallic and ceramic solutions. Today several groups are applying KCMS to measure thermodynamic functions in multicomponent metallic and ceramic systems. Thermodynamic functions, especially component activities, are extremely important in the development of CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) type thermodynamic descriptions. These descriptions, in turn, are useful for modeling materials processing and predicting reactions such as oxide formation and fiber/matrix interactions. The leading experimental methods for measuring activities are the Galvanic cell or electro-motive force (EMF) technique and the KCMS technique. Each has specific advantages, depending on material and conditions. The EMF technique is suitable for lower temperature measurements, provided a suitable cell can be constructed. KCMS is useful for higher temperature measurements in a system with volatile components. In this paper, we briefly review the KCMS technique and identify the major experimental issues that must be addressed for precise measurements. These issues include temperature measurements, cell material and cell design and absolute pressure calibration. The resolution of these issues are discussed together with some recent examples of measured thermodynamic data...|$|E

According to the scheme, at the fust reaction stage the Pdiketone HL,, and [LM(L- H) lads and [L 4 Mz(L- H) ],d, intermediate species are formed on the surface in the "low-temperature " stage of decomposition processes. In the next "high-temperature " stage these intermediate species are decomposed to produce ML 2, ML and (C&O), (C 5 H 60) 2 gas species and metal oxides on the surface.

A moderate correlation was observed between the amount of removed fluid and impedance change in the low frequency domain using the “Foot to Hand” vector (r=- 0. 7). Conclusion. Bioelectrical impedance changes in correlation with the thoracic fluid level. It was feasible to monitor significant fluid shifts and loss after thoracentesis in the “Transthoracic” vector by means of bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. The trial is registered with Registration Numbers IRB EK 206 / 11 and NCT 01778270...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBack groundPleural {{effusion}} {{remains a}} diagnostic challenge. A number of tumor markers might facilitate {{the identification of}} patients with malignancies. ObjectiveTo assess the value of Dikkopf- 1 concentrations in both serum and pleural fluid in the differentiation between malignant and non malignant pleural <b>effusions.</b> <b>Methods</b> 47 patients with pleural effusions {{were enrolled in the}} study. They were classified into two groups: group I: 24 patients with malignant effusions, group II: 23 patients with non malignant effusions. Thoracentesis with biochemical, cytological and bacteriological examination of pleural fluid and determination of Dikkopf- 1 level in serum and pleural fluid were done. ResultsSerum and pleural levels of DKK- 1 were significantly higher in the malignant group compared with the non-malignant group. At cut off point 3091 pg/ml serum DKK- 1 shows 100 % sensitivity and 91. 3 % specificity while at cut off point 4607 pg/ml pleural DKK- 1 levels showed 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. In the non malignant group, serum and pleural levels of DKK- 1 were significantly higher in TB patients compared to pneumonia and liver cirrhosis. ConclusionsMalignant effusions are associated with elevated serum and pleural DKK- 1 level but it cannot be used as sure marker for the diagnosis of malignancy since it rises in many other conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims. Medical thoracoscopy, {{also called}} pleuroscopy, has {{received}} {{renewed interest in}} the recent past for diagnostic as well as therapeutic uses. In this study, we describe our experience with thoracoscopy for undiagnosed pleural <b>effusions.</b> <b>Methods.</b> In a retrospective analysis of thoracoscopic procedures we performed between January 2007 and December 2008, yield of thoracoscopic pleural biopsy for achieving a diagnosis in undiagnosed pleural effusions, defined as pleural effusions with adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels less than 70 IU/L and negative pleural fluid cytology for malignancy on three occasions was evaluated. Complications of thoracoscopy were also analysed. Results. Overall diagnostic yield of thoracoscopic pleural biopsy was 74. 3 % in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. Pleural malignancy was diagnosed in 48. 6 % of patients. There was only one case of mesothelioma and the rest were due to pleural metastasis. Lung cancer and breast cancer were the most common sites of primary malignancy. Tuberculosis was diagnosed with pleural biopsy in 22. 8 % of patients. We had low complication rate after thoracoscopy. Only two cases of empyema were observed. Conclusion. Medical thoracoscopy is a safe procedure and has good diagnostic yield in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions.
