5|$|Able {{to return}} to Another world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, {{allowing}} him {{to return to}} his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, Another world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift <b>Kid</b> <b>from</b> her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger, visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past. The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to pull in a counterbalance from a different dimension. This was Dinopolis, a city of Dragonians—parallel universe descendants of Chrono Triggers Reptites. The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.|$|E

500|$|In {{literature}} Tunis' contributions {{have sometimes}} been direct. His baseball books, especially The <b>Kid</b> <b>from</b> Tomkinsville, {{have been cited}} as one source of inspiration for Bernard Malamud's book The Natural, about baseball star Roy Hobbs. Among other similarities, both Hobbs and Tucker started as pitchers but, thanks to accidents, ended up as outfielders and power-hitters. It has been suggested by Michele Schiavone in her study of Tunis' influence on Malamud and Roth that, as an early fan of the Dodgers, Malamud was familiar with Tunis' books and borrowed from them, [...] "consciously or not". Bruce Brooks' introduction to the 1987 edition of The <b>Kid</b> <b>from</b> Tomkinsville [...] says that Tunis [...] "obviously" [...] inspired Mark Harris, author of Bang the Drum Slowly. And in what D. G. Myers in Best Baseball Books Ever called [...] "one of the best pieces of (literary) criticism ever written", The <b>Kid</b> <b>from</b> Tomkinsville is referenced by Nathan Zuckerman, the main character in Philip Roth's novel American Pastoral. For Zuckerman, Tunis' book and pitcher Roy Tucker become what Schiavone called [...] "a template for Zuckerman's view of the Swede", and his realization of the [...] "tragic underside to the American Dream".|$|E
500|$|The casting directors, Patrick J. Rush and Alyson Silverberg, began {{selecting}} the principal cast {{eight to ten}} weeks before filming started.

Other central characters in the episode are Seth's parents—Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan)—and teenage next-door neighbor Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton).|$|E

However, Doby's second strike {{was the result of a}} foul ball, both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in addition, Gordon was standing on third base during Doby's at-bat.

Muhney was very pleased to be a series regular, comparing his status to becoming a family member in the show rather than [...] "someone who comes over for dinner occasionally." [...] Piz (Chris Lowell) was named after the director of the show's pilot episode, Mark Piznarski. He was created in order to give Veronica a male friend who was not upper class.

500|$|The {{television}} show was noted {{as a part}} of the mid-2000s films, television, and books that drove a resurgence of the public popularity of magic. Criss Angel Mindfreak was the first weekly magic {{television show}} to air in forty years. Daily Variety reviewed the premiere writing, [...] "The stunts alone are impressive. But what makes the show fascinating are the down-home touches in which we see the <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> New York, who first honed his magic skills at the age of 6. Keenly aware of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved. Viewers follow the illusionist as he contemplates new and more dangerous stunts, while his crew, including his often-fretful brothers, offer insight as to what, other than ego, drives someone in this profession." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} impressed by Smith's performances. Pete Paphides, writing for The Times, {{said that the}} songs were performed [...] "with power and restraint", while Johnny Davis, writing for The Observer, said [...] "ou can practically hear Katherine Jenkins weep as Faryl flawlessly executes Amazing Grace". Jason Birchmeier, writing for Allmusic, considered Smith's performance even more noteworthy because of her young age. However, though he considered Smith's voice impressive, Malcolm Mackenzie, writing for The London Paper, asked [...] "will we care when the <b>kid</b> <b>from</b> Kettering loses her precocious appeal?" [...] Reviewers also responded positively to Cohen's contribution to the album. Paphides claimed that his arrangements [...] "suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist", while Birchmeier claimed that the album was [...] "produced with fine precision".|$|E

[...] Though his papers only list Tucker as [...] "Number 36", they do say that, among others, [...] "Gabby" [...] Gus was based on Leo Durocher and Tucker's Rabbi was inspired by Luke Sewell. Kirkus gave it another starred review, saying it [...] "struck a new note". Tucker's story continues in 1941's World Series.|$|E
