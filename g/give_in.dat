5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in Some Like It Hot (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to <b>Give</b> <b>in</b> June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} <b>give,</b> <b>in</b> a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw.

5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. He decided that Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of exclusive rights to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine.

Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but <b>give</b> <b>in</b> when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build.

5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's Got to <b>Give</b> <b>in</b> which she swam naked in a {{swimming}} pool. To generate advance publicity, {{the press was}} invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to <b>give</b> <b>in,</b> but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburgian margraves {{had long}} sought to expand northwards, {{connecting}} land-locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea. The Treaty of Grimnitz (1529) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania upon {{the extinction of}} the local House of Pomerania, and would have come into effect {{by the death of}} Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. By the Treaty of Stettin (1630) however, Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden, who refused to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to the Brandenburgian claim. The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden, who determined the exact border in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder (Swedish Pomerania), while Brandenburg gained the eastern part (Farther Pomerania). Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome, and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of Pomerania was {{to become one of the}} main goals of his foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} did not <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to the ultimatum, and two days later, on 11 October 1899, the Second Anglo-Boer War (South African War) broke out. When the British army marched on Pretoria in May 1900, the government was forced to flee the capital. From that moment on, Reitz {{was responsible for the}} continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal, which occurred sixty-two times until March 1902. In May of that year, Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British, {{and he was one of}} the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{was to have}} a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist—he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered. Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris on November 15, 1917. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.|$|E
