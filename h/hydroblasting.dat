40|$|Waste-to-energy boiler fire-side fouling {{is a major}} {{operational}} {{issue for}} many facilities, including the Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility. The Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility is a 350 ton per day, mass burn waterwall facility that began operation in 1987. Fouling occurs throughout the convection sections with the highest differential pressure occurring across the generating bank. Flue gas differential pressures and temperatures have been tracked and analyzed at the facility for approximately ten years during various operating conditions. It has been determined {{that the rate of}} increase of the differential pressure across the generating bank is correlated with flue gas temperature and the extent of fouling. Several different cleaning methods have been used to clear the convection zone of ash deposits, including off-line <b>hydroblasting,</b> on-line <b>hydroblasting,</b> on-line explosives cleaning, sootblowers and sonic horns [...] Better understanding of the fouling trends and evaluation of cleaning methods has led the facility to use a combination of on-line <b>hydroblasting</b> and explosives cleaning and off-line <b>hydroblasting.</b> The facility is now able to operate one year between planned outages, compared to ten weeks during the initial operation of the facility. Additional savings have also been achieved by reducing induced draft fan load, and possibly a reduction in tube wastage...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Hydroblast</b> Research Cell at MSFC {{is both a}} {{research}} and a processing facility. The cell is used to investigate fundamental phenomena associated with waterjets {{as well as to}} clean hardware for various NASA and contractor projects. In the area of research, investigations are made regarding the use of high pressure waterjets to strip paint, grease, adhesive and thermal spray coatings from various substrates. Current industrial methods of cleaning often use ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) such as chlorinated solvents, and high pressure waterjet cleaning {{has proven to be a}} viable alternative. Standard methods of waterjet cleaning use hand held or robotically controlled nozzles. The nozzles used can be single-stream or multijet nozzles, and the multijet nozzles may be mounted in a rotating head or arranged in a fan-type shape. We consider in this paper the use of a rotating, multijet, high pressure water nozzle which is robotically controlled. This method enables rapid cleaning of a large area, but problems such as incomplete coverage (e. g. the formation of 'islands' of material not cleaned) and damage to the substrate from the waterjet have been observed. In addition, current stripping operations require the nozzle to be placed at a standoff distance of approximately 2 inches in order to achieve adequate performance. This close proximity of the nozzle to the target to be cleaned poses risks to the nozzle and the target in the event of robot error or the striking of unanticipated extrusions on the target surface as the nozzle sweeps past. Two key motivations of this research are to eliminate the formation of 'coating islands' and to increase the allowable standoff distance of the nozzle...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this project undertaken by the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) {{is to develop a}} recycling technology for reducing the volume of boiler <b>hydroblasting</b> wastewater at Naval Shipyards by up to 90 percent. Steam boiler tubes of a Navy ship undergoing regular overhaul are cleaned twice by <b>hydroblasting.</b> The first washing is performed before ship overhaul and the second washing after ship overhaul. The initial feasibility study, completed in FY 88, involved bench scale work at NCEL and pilot scale tests at Long Beach (LBNSY) and Norfolk ___ Naval Shipyards (NNSY). Full scale field tests were conducted at NNSY in FY 89. The 1 wastewater recycling process consisted of five steps: collecting, settling, filtering, ___w reconditioning, and reusing. All five steps were successfully demonstrated in the three 00 series of field tests. These tests were assisted by and coordinated with NNSY and-(. Naval Ship Systems Engineering Station (NAVSSES). The results show that the hy-Sr droblasting wastewater could be recycled nine times to achieve 90 percent reduction without any adverse effect. The recycling unit- is to be put alongside an existing hydroblast (watcrjet) unit. The same safety precautions for <b>hydroblasting</b> operations are applicable to and should be observed for recycling operations. A 90 percent reduction represents approximately $ 8 million/year savings on wastewater disposal costs. More significant economic benefit can be realized if the recycling technology is adopted for boiler tube cleaning done at Navy activities outside Naval Shipyards...|$|E

There are several methods available for removal of PCBs contaminated oil from the environment including solvent washing and <b>hydroblasting</b> followed by encapsulation in epoxy coatings, but these methods are ineffective for the removal of PCBs successfully. Alternatively, MICP is able to produce a coating to seal PCBs-contaminated areas. Indeed, MICP coated areas showed no leaching and a reduction in permeability of 1 – 5 orders or magnitude (Okwadha and Li 2011).|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{considerations}} {{have been}} developed {{on the influence of}} surface roughness on the adherence of a repairing systems on a concrete support : sandblasting, hammering, <b>hydroblasting,</b> acid attacks,… have been analysed by a lot of authors. This presentation gives a parametric interpretation of a sandblasted surface in comparison with a polished concrete. A stylus is walked along the surface to be analysed and the profile is continuously registered. The filtration of the electric signal is realised in order to separate waviness and roughness. The effect of the stylus/component profile contact on the validity of the measurement results is of prime importance. Profilometry and surfometry are mathematically described by statistical and amplitude parameters. The analysis of surfometry profiles let us to observe and quantify the shape regularity and the isotropic effect of sandblasting. The bearing ratio curves permit to quantify the volume of voids able to absorb the slurry or the repairing mortar applied on the support. The difference, between the two surface treatments is clearly quantified and related to adherence properties of some hydraulic binders. Peer reviewe...|$|E

A robot, mounted on a transportable platform, controls the waterjet angle, water pressure and flow rate. This technology, now known as ARMS, has found commercial applications in the removal of coatings from jet engine components. The system is significantly faster than manual procedures and uses only minimal labor. Because the amount of "substrate" lost is minimal, the life of the component is extended. The need for toxic chemicals is reduced, as is waste disposal and human protection equipment. Users of the ARMS work cell include Delta Air Lines and the Air Force, which later contracted with USBI for development of a Large Aircraft Paint Stripping system (LARPS). LARPS' advantages are similar to ARMS, and it has enormous potential in military and civil aircraft maintenance.

40|$|Characterization {{of copper}} and zinc {{concentrations}} in shipyard wash waters and removal coincident with treatment operations that are targeting tributyltin removal is presented. Copper and zinc were observed to be major components of shipyard wash waters ranging in concentration from 250 to 140, 000 ppb total copper and 600 to 72, 000 ppb total zinc. High concentrations {{were associated with}} the large amount of particulate material in the waters generated through wash down and <b>hydroblasting</b> of ship hulls. Batch coagulation/clarification in the laboratory was conducted from pH 6 to pH 10. Consistent with pH dependent solubility of a metal oxyhydroxide, copper and zinc removals were greater at higher pH with zinc more effectively removed than copper. Solubilization of organic matter from the particulate fraction that was observed at higher pH may include organo-copper complexes that increase solubility. Removal of both metals was observed to substantially occur by treatment with granular activated carbon. Removal is likely related to both particulate and dissolved metals removal, possibly through removal of metal-organic complexes of zinc and copper.
