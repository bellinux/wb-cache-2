Cohn {{argues that the}} tefillin should be perceived as an invented tradition aimed at counteracting {{the popularity of the}} Greek amulets with an “original” Jewish one. In fact, some more anthropologically inclined scholars like Joshua Trachtenberg, considered every ornament worn on the body (whatever its declared function) as initially serving the purpose of an amulet. In addition to this the early Rabbinic sources furnish more or less explicit examples of the apotropaic qualities of tefillin. For instance, Bamidbar R. 12:3 presents tefillin as capable of defeating “a thousand demons” emerging on “the left side,” rabbis Yohanan and Nahman used their sets to repel the fiends inhabiting privies in BT Berakhot 23a-b, whereas Elisha the Winged, who was scrupulous in performing this mitzvah, was miraculously saved from the Roman persecution in BT Shabbat 49a. Also, tefillin are believed to possess life-lengthening qualities, as suggested in BT Menahot 36b, 44a-b and in BT Shabbat 13a-b and they are often listed in one breath among various items which are considered amuletic in nature, {{as is the case in}} M <b>Kelim</b> 23:1, M Eruvin 10:1 or BT Eruvin 96b-97a.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known and most highly regarded, these kilims (or <b>kelims)</b> are {{traditionally}} distinguished by the areas, villages or cities {{in which they are}} produced, such as Konya, Malatya, Karapinar and Hotamis. Most Anatolian kilims are slit woven. Larger antique kilims were woven in two to three separate sections on small nomadic horizontal floor looms in three feet wide long strips, then carefully sewn together matching the patterns edges to create an ultimately wider rug. These pieces are still being produced in very limited quantities by nomadic tribes for their personal use and are commonly known as cicims.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{the major}} Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans. Spanish carpets, which {{sometimes}} interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include coats of arms, enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the Papal Palace, Avignon, and the industry continued after the Reconquista. [...] Armenian carpet-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought. The Berber carpets of North Africa have a distinct design tradition. Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, {{there was also a}} large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs. As well as pile carpets, <b>kelims</b> and other types of flat-weave or embroidered textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls. Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.|$|R

It contains thirty chapters, making it the longest tractate in the entire Mishnah. The Tosefta on Keilim consists of twenty-five chapters, divided into Bava Kama ("First Gate"), Bava Metzia ("Middle Gate"), and Bava Batra ("Final Gate") of Keilim. The tractate discusses the laws of ritual purity and impurity pertaining to all types of vessels.|$|E
5000|$|The rabbis of the Talmud {{were aware}} of occurrences of {{inclusio}} in the Bible, as shown by R. Yohanan's comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that [...] "Any psalm dear to David he opened with [...] "אשרי" [...] ('happy is he') and closed with [...] "אשרי" [...] ('happy is he'). Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At {{the end of the}} Mishnah tractate <b>Kelim,</b> R. Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: [...] "Happy are you, <b>Kelim,</b> in that you opened with regarding impurity and departed with regarding purity." [...] Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the שמע (Hear O Israel) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate's opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate's end. Tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (M. Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (M. Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} reasoning for {{the order}} of the tractates (according to Rambam) is as follows. <b>Kelim</b> is first as it introduces the levels of impurity, and dictates to which object the various impurities apply at all. Oholot follows because it outlines the most serious type of impurity. Negaim follows because it is next in severity and because, like a corpse, a metzorah transmits tent-impurity. Parah follows as it outlines the purification for the severe impurities already dealt with. The next stage is lesser impurities (Tohorot) and their method of purification which is immersion (Mikvaot). Niddah follows as it is also a lesser impurity but it has the extra feature of applying to only a portion of people (i.e. to women). Makshirin, Zavim and Tevul Tom follow Niddah based on Scriptural order. The next stage down is impurities that are Rabbinic only (Yadaim). Finally, Uktzin is last as it is restricted and has no Scriptural source, the laws being derived from the reasoning of the Sages.|$|E
5000|$|The Tillamook {{were the}} southernmost {{branch of the}} Coast Salish. They were {{separated}} from their more northern kinsmen by tribes speaking the Chinookian languages.

The latter name means the place of Elim, or in the Cathlamet dialect, the place of <b>Kelim.</b> The initial t of Tillamook is the plural article, the terminal ook the Chinook plural ending —uks." [...] Since there was one village {{in the area of}} Nehalem bay; the area was referred to as Nekelim (Ne Elim=singular). There were at least four villages on the south Tillamook bay according to Lewis and Clark; the south bay was called [...] "T-Elim-ook" [...] (the plural of Elim), meaning many villages of Elim. (The Chinook word for water was [...] "chuck" [...] and the Salish word for wetland is [...] "naslex". The popular translation of Tillamook as meaning [...] "land of many waters" [...] seems to be 20th-century fabrication used in the tourist industry.) ...|$|E

Meg. 71c). Shimon appears to have studied natural science as well, for some of his sayings betray a scientific knowledge of the nature of plants and animals, while others concern the anatomy of the human body and the means of avoiding or of curing disease (Ber. 25a, 40a; Shab. 78a, 128b; Yeb. 80b; Ket. 59b, 110b).

40|$|A story {{recorded}} from TS Ronrang in Balinong village: They {{belong to}} the Weti clan. The Kelims are not Ronrang {{but there are some}} Kelims in Kimching, in Juglei and in Mossangs. Then he told me a story: the latter part of which is recorded in audio; the beginning is as follows: It seems in a place called Wimpung, there was a clan called <b>Kelim</b> who were strong and brave and handsome. A girl from their Weti clan said she wanted to get married to a <b>Kelim</b> and so she went up to the king of the Kelims and said that I wish to get married into the family. The old man did not know whether she was mad or serious and decided to test how good a wife she would make. He asked her to pound some rice in a dheki but put an egg in the dheki before leaving. She carefully removed the egg from the dheki and put it away safely before pounding the rice as asked. Then there were two more tests after which she was allowed to get married. SDM-ass- 2011 - 01 - 11 - 07 -MB-Balinong-T-S-Rera-story. wav The second test was that they gave her some dhan to dry and pound but mixed it with a lot of rat-leavings. When she put the paddy out to dry the next day the girl saw all the rat-shit and carefully separated the shit from the grains, dried the grain and pounded it. One day the old man pretended to be going to the fields to work but actually hid to watch how the girl took care {{of the children in the}} house. He was most impressed by the way she lovingly took care of all of them. It made the old man very happy. In this manner 1 - 2 weeks went by in which the girl could get an impression of each of the 4 - 5 sons. One day the old man dressed up his idiot son in the best clothes and his best and favourite son in tatters. He then asked her to choose – she made no mistake and choose the best. This was enough proof for the old man and he told her that he would go to her parents and make a marriage proposal. But the Weti are rich and powerful people (who had sacrificed humans and bufflaoes) and the other girls in the village were very jealous of this girl who was going to marry a Weti man. So they would not allow her to draw clean water, nor would they allow her to join them to collect firewood. They generally harrassed her and ragged her and she was very upset and went to her mother and told her about her troubles. Her worst problem was to do with getting clean water for the family – the village girsl would firts take their water and then make it muddy before she could collect hers. The mother told her not to worry and gave her a crab and a banana plant and told her to go and find a moist and wet place and to plant to banana plant there and put the crab under it. From the next day and little pool of water formed there and it soon became a stream called the Wan-wi Kham-ki (Wan-wi is the name of the old lady, kham is water, and ki means to plant). It seems this little stream exists in Burma even now. His grandparents told him this story...|$|E
40|$|View of a {{military}} ceremony in a large courtyard surrounded by barracks. Soldiers are lined up in the right half of the yard in approximately ten rows, headed by officers, all standing to attention.

A second head covering is deposited on the ground under the table. The scene is being watched by various spectators, mostly officers, while a small group of women and children can also be discerned in the background. The yard is richly decorated for the occasion with garlands and colourful <b>kelim</b> rugs. The 'Knez Mihailo' Second Infantry Division of the Royal Serbian Army lost half of its fighters during the wars of 1912 to 1918. After its reformation as part of the Royal Yugoslav Army, it was given the honorary name 'Gvozdeni puk' (steel division) for its bravery and sacrifice during the Great War. The division’s commemoration day slava continued to be held on 19 April, the anniversary of the withdrawal of Ottoman forces in 1868, celebrated as 'Predaja gradova' (surrender of the fortresses). On this day, the Ottoman garrisons left the then Princedom of Serbia for good, symbolically handing over the keys of all fortresses on its territory to Serbian Prince Mihailo Obrenović, after whom the division was named. Serbia remained under formal Ottoman suzerainty until 1878 and was elevated to a kingdom in 1882. — The photograph was published in the newspaper Vreme on 26 April 1930, a day after the ceremony took place that year.
