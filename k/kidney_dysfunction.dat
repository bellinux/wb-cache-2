40|$|BACKGROUND Kidney {{function}} is accurately assessed by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). GFR is estimated with various biomarkers like inulin, creatinine and Cystatin C. Inulin is not synthesised {{in the human}} body. Creatinine is a variable parameter. But, Cystatin C is removed completely from the blood stream by glomerular filtration. Hence, Cystatin C level in the blood {{can be used to}} estimate GFR. MATERIALS AND METHODS One study group of 50 patients with renal failure and another control group of 50 normal persons were selected for Cystatin C estimation. Cystatin C was measured in a random sample of serum of both control group and study group by using Quantitative Cystatin C immunoturbidimetric assay. Mean values of Cystatin C were statistically analysed by using “t” test. GFR from Cystatin C value was measured by using a prediction equation. RESULTS Cystatin C levels in blood were significantly increased in patients of renal failure. GFR was estimated by Cystatin C levels. The elevated Cystatin C level was correlated with estimated GFR. CONCLUSION Cystatin C level in patients of <b>kidneys</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was statistically elevated. Similarly, the GFR estimated using serum Cystatin C was also statistically elevated. Hence, Cystatin C was a good biological marker to assess <b>kidneys</b> <b>dysfunction...</b>|$|R

5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunction</b> during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

Other causes {{that may lead to}} similar symptoms include ischemic renal failure (<b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunction</b> due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as thrombotic microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).|$|E

25|$|African trypanosomiasis {{symptoms}} {{occur in}} two stages. The first stage, {{known as the}} hemolymphatic phase, is characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching. Fever is intermittent, with attacks lasting from a day to a week, separated by intervals of {{a few days to}} a month or longer. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic systems by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. Winterbottom's sign, the tell-tale swollen lymph nodes along the back of the neck, may appear. Occasionally, a chancre (red sore) will develop at the location of the tsetse fly bite. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b>|$|R

25|$|In many {{patients}} with ADPKD, <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is not clinically apparent until forty or {{fifty years of}} life. There is, however, an increasing body of evidence that suggests the formation of renal cysts starts in utero. Cysts initially form as small dilations in renal tubules, which then expand to form fluid-filled cavities of different sizes. Factors suggested to lead to cystogenesis include a germline mutation {{in one of the}} polycystin gene alleles, a somatic second hit that leads to the loss of the normal allele, and a third hit, which can be anything that triggers cell proliferation, leading to the dilation of the tubules. In the progression of the disease, continued dilation of the tubules through increased cell proliferation, fluid secretion, and separation from the parental tubule lead to the formation of cysts.|$|E

500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunction</b> due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the nature}} of COPD, {{multiple}} comorbidities are associated with the symptoms and development of COPD including inflammation and heart and <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> This presents a unique challenge to the clinician in terms of maintaining the correct balance between raising pressures and delivering oxygen, while keeping hypercapnea and hypoxia to a minimum [33],[34]. The clinician needs to monitor multiple aspects of physiology simultaneously, and many adverse effects are not always immediately clear. Currently, MV is applied in a rather generic manner; however, the clinicians have recognized the need for accounting for inter-patient variation [35],[36]. VALI due to overstretching of lung parenchyma can be minimized by applying lower tidal volumes [37], but this needs to be achieved without allowing PaCO 2 and pH to rise to dangerous levels (permitted hypercapnea). Sophisticated computer simulation platforms that can accurately represent individual COPD patient characteristics could provide a powerful experimental tool for the development of improved treatment strategies for COPD that address many of the above issues.|$|R

[...] aHUS often presents with malaise and fatigue, as well as microangiopathic anemia. However, severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are unusual. [...] Laboratory tests may also reveal low levels of platelets (cells in the blood that aid in clotting), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage), decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells), anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (indicative of <b>kidney</b> <b>dysfunction),</b> and proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury). Patients with aHUS often present with an abrupt onset of systemic {{signs and symptoms}} such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, or coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, kidney, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression. For example, approximately 1 in 6 patients with aHUS initially will present with proteinuria or hematuria without acute kidney failure.

Here, we report the use of a sperm-specific promoter and interbreeding of transgenic and gene knockout mice for generating a mouse strain that expressed ACE only in sperm. The experimental mice maintained the kidney defects of ACE-/- mice, but unlike the knockout strain, the males were fertile.
