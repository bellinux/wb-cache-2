With the corresponding tool selected, fine adjustment of each set of objects in a score are possible either by clicking and dragging or by entering measurements in a dialog box. A more generalized selection tool is also available to select large measure regions for <b>editing</b> <b>key</b> and time signatures, or transposing, among other uses. This tool also {{provides the}} ability to reposition several classes of score object directly, and more recent versions of the software have implemented extensive contextual menuing via this tool.|$|E

40|$|The CRISPR/Cas 9 {{system is}} a highly {{effective}} tool for genome <b>editing.</b> <b>Key</b> to robust genome editing is the efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas 9 machinery. Viral delivery systems are efficient vehicles for the transduction of foreign genes but commonly used viral vectors suffer from a limited capacity in the genetic information they can carry. Baculovirus however is capable of carrying large exogenous DNA fragments. Here we investigate the use of baculoviral vectors as a delivery vehicle for CRISPR/Cas 9 based genome-editing tools. We demonstrate transduction of a panel of cell lines with Cas 9 and an sgRNA sequence, which results in efficient knockout of all four targeted subunits of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). We further show that introduction of a homology directed repair template into the same CRISPR/Cas 9 baculovirus facilitates introduction of specific point mutations and endogenous gene tags. Tagging of the CPC recruitment factor Haspin with the fluorescent reporter YFP allowed us to study its native localization as well as recruitment to the cohesin subunit Pds 5 B...|$|E
40|$|RNA editing is a posttranscriptional {{modification}} {{that can}} lead to a change in the encoded protein sequence of a gene. Although a few cases of mammalian coding RNA editing are known to be functionally important, the vast majority of over 2, 000 A-to-I editing sites that have been identified from the coding regions of the human genome are likely nonadaptive, representing tolerable promiscuous targeting of editing enzymes. Finding the potentially tiny fraction of beneficial editing sites from the sea of mostly nearly neutral editing is a difficult but important task. Here, we propose and provide evidence that evolutionarily conserved or “hardwired ” residues that experience high-level nonsynonymous RNA editing in a species are enriched with beneficial editing. This simple approach allows the prediction of sites where RNA editing is functionally important. We suggest that priority be given to these candidates in future characterizations of the functional and fitness consequences of RNA <b>editing.</b> <b>Key</b> words: editing level, evolution, human, nonsynonymous. RNA editing posttranscriptionally alters RNA sequences through insertion, deletion, or modification of nucleotides, with the exception of some common forms of RNA process-ing such as splicing, 50 -capping, and 30 -polyadenylation, whic...|$|E

5000|$|The {{keyboard}} had flat tops, {{similar to}} the HP 9800 series desktop computers rather than the curved contours now considered to be ergonomic. It featured three keypad areas: Alphabetic, numeric, {{and an array of}} cursor positioning and <b>editing</b> <b>keys</b> somewhat similar to modern PC keyboard layouts. There were also a number of smaller function and feature control keys arrayed in two rows above the normal keypad areas. The keyboard chassis was separate from the main body, connected via a thick cable. The keyboard used a bit-paired layout (similar to that on a teleprinter machine) rather than the typewriter-paired arrangement on DEC's VT100. Although large, users loved the keyboard because [...] "it had a key for everything".|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} {{guidelines to}} reduce potential bias, ensure consistent estimates, and simplify analysis, by correcting inconsistent {{data in a}} data set (i. e., edits) or substituting values for missing (i. e., imputation) or inconsistent data in a data set (i. e., <b>edits).</b> <b>KEY</b> TERMS: cross-sectional, cross-sectional imputations, cross-wave imputations, edit, freshened sample, imputation, item nonresponse, key variables, longitudinal, nonresponse bias, overall unit nonresponse, response rate, stage of data collection, unit nonresponse, and universe. STANDARD 4 - 1 - 1 : All data must be edited. Data editing is an iterative and interactive process that includes procedures for detecting and correcting errors in the data. Data editing is first done prior to imputation. Data editing must be repeated after the data are imputed, and again after the data are altered during disclosure risk analysis (without jeopardizing the disclosure protections).

5000|$|Prior to the Windows Registry, [...]INI files stored each program's {{settings}} as a text file, often {{located in}} a shared location that did not provide user-specific settings in a multi-user scenario. By contrast, the Windows Registry stores all application settings in one logical repository (but a number of discrete files) and in a standardized form. According to Microsoft, this offers several advantages over [...]INI files. Since file parsing is done much more efficiently with a binary format, it may be read from or written to more quickly than an INI file. As well, strongly typed data {{can be stored in}} the Registry, as opposed to the text information stored in [...]INI files. This is a benefit when <b>editing</b> <b>keys</b> manually using regedit.exe, the built-in Windows Registry Editor. Because user-based Registry settings are loaded from a user-specific path rather than from a read-only system location, the Registry allows multiple users to share the same machine, and also allows programs to work for less privileged users. Backup and restoration is also simplified as the Registry can be accessed over a network connection for remote management/support, including from scripts, using the standard set of APIs, as long as the Remote Registry service is running and firewall rules permit this.|$|R
