25|$|The nominal furnace loading has {{increased}} {{during the last}} ten years and will continue to increase. Changes in air design have increased furnace temperatures. This has enabled a significant increase in hearth solids loading (HSL) with only a modest design increase in hearth <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate (HHRR). The average flue gas flow decreases as less water vapor is present. So the vertical flue gas velocities can be reduced even with increasing temperatures in lower furnace.|$|E
25|$|UCP1 is {{a protein}} {{predominantly}} found in BAT. It acts to dissipate the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation, {{leading to the}} production of <b>heat.</b> <b>Release</b> of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves results in UCP1 activation and usually occurs after extended periods of cold exposure or in response to overfeeding. UCP1 activity is stimulated by long chain fatty acids that are produced subsequent to β-adrenergic receptor activation. UCP1 is proposed to function as a fatty acid proton symporter, although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In contrast, UCP1 is inhibited by ATP, ADP, and GTP.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous water {{represents}} {{a small but}} environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42°C (-44°F) to 4.24% when the dew point is 30°C (86°F). Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, {{is one of the}} most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red region of the light spectrum.|$|E

500|$|The {{vertical}} {{wind shear}} in a tropical cyclone's environment is very important. When the wind shear is weak, the storms {{that are part}} of the cyclone grow vertically, and the latent heat from condensation is released into the air directly above the storm, aiding in development. When there is stronger wind shear, this means that the storms become more slanted and the latent <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> is dispersed over a much larger area ...|$|E

In the presence of a heated catalyst, [...] will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately [...] Because of the large <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary, as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse (Isp) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating.|$|E

On the other hand, if the Rayleigh Index is negative, then thermoacoustic damping occurs. The Rayleigh Criterion implies that a thermoacoustic instability can be optimally controlled by having <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> oscillations 180 degrees out of phase with pressure oscillations at the same frequency.

As follows from thermodynamic laws, an exothermic reaction is favoured at lower temperatures. This is indeed represented in Fig.  8 b, where, at lower temperatures, the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> from the reaction is much more pronounced, than the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> at higher temperatures. Additionally, at lower temperatures, the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> is primarily from the splitting of water, {{which is much more}} exothermic than the corresponding CO 2 splitting reaction, which gains predominance at higher temperatures. However, the overall reaction continues to be exothermic. Indeed, the drop of exothermicity at higher temperatures impacts on the overall system efficiency and thermodynamics and has been subsequently discussed in the following sections.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a comprehensive approach}} for calculating buildings' energy contribution {{to the formation of}} urban heat island (UHI). For this purpose, the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> by building envelope and HVAC system has been taken into account, while longwave radiation to the sky has been excluded from the calculation, as it is not so relevant to the UHI effect. Several strategies to minimize the UHI phenomenon and their effects on the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> have been considered along the whole-year period. An existing educational building has been selected as case study. The selected building is considered representative {{for a wide range of}} tertiary buildings with an intermittent operation mode. Results have been obtained by dynamic simulation models, which have been validated with measured indoor air temperature data. Despite a moderate reduction of the energy contribution to the UHI effect during winter, which is commonly considered unfavorable, the effectiveness of cool coating application in reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> during summer has been clearly demonstrated.
