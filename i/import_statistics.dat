50|$|Paraguay is {{a member}} of the Common Market of the South (Mercado Común del Sur or Mercosur). Most of Paraguay’s trade takes place with Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina. In 2002 Paraguay {{conducted}} more than US$400 million in trade with Argentina and nearly US$800 million with Brazil. Paraguay is also a member of the Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American Integration Association, and Latin American Economic System and a signatory to the agreement creating the South American Community of Nations. In 2004 Paraguay signed an energy cooperation agreement with Venezuela to purchase oil and petroleum. Venezuela agreed to concessional financing that allowed Paraguay to pay over a 15-year period at a nominal interest rate. Imports totaled US$3.3 billion in 2004. Principal import commodities included automobiles, chemical products, consumer goods, tobacco, petroleum, and machinery. Brazil was the leading source of imports to Paraguay (24.3 percent), followed by the United States (22.3 percent), Argentina (16.2 percent), China (9.9 percent), and Hong Kong (5 percent). Experts note that <b>import</b> <b>statistics</b> are difficult to confirm for Paraguay because as much as half of all imports are illegally re-exported to Argentina or Brazil. Imports from Mercosur countries continue to rise, up to 57 percent in 2003. Paraguay’s export revenues totaled about US$2.9 billion in 2004. Agricultural commodities continue to drive Paraguay’s export totals. Soybeans are particularly vital, accounting for 35 percent of total export revenues in 2003. Other agricultural cash crops include cotton, sugarcane, cassava, sunflowers, wheat, and corn. Other significant exports include feed, meat, edible oils, electricity, wood, and leather. Even as Paraguayan export revenue has fluctuated, Brazil remained Paraguay’s principal export destination (27.8 percent in 2004), followed by Uruguay (15.9 percent), Italy (7.1 percent), Switzerland (5.6 percent), Argentina (4.3 percent), and the Netherlands (4.2 percent). In 2003 nearly 60 percent of Paraguayan exports went to Mercosur countries. Paraguay had a negative trade balance of about US$400 million in 2004. Higher earnings from soybeans and cotton could not offset the surge in imported consumer goods and petroleum products. After years of negative balances, Paraguay achieved a positive balance of payments totaling US$234 million in 2003. In 2004, however, the current account had an estimated deficit of US$35.1 million. Paraguay has a sustainable debt level according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). External debt totaled about US$3.4 billion in 2004, low compared to most Latin American countries. Continued reductions in Paraguay’s debt to gross domestic product ratio are expected in coming years. Paraguay paid US$412 million in debt service to the IMF in 2004. Foreign investment in Paraguay nearly disappeared in 2002. After direct foreign investment of US$84 million in 2001, only US$9 million in investment came from abroad in 2002. This drop was largely the result of the financial crisis in Argentina and the banking collapse in Paraguay. Direct foreign investment rebounded in 2003, reaching US$90.8 million for the year. Paraguay has depended on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank for economic development assistance. The World Bank has promised Paraguay assistance totaling US$325 million between 2003 and 2007. Projects currently underway in Paraguay aim to improve education, transportation, and rural development.|$|E

No validation studies of reported consumption of tobacco or alcohol have been published from circumpolar indigenous communities. Objective. The purpose of the study is to compare information on the consumption of tobacco and alcohol obtained from 3 population surveys in Greenland with <b>import</b> <b>statistics.</b> Design. Estimates of consumption of cigarettes and alcohol using several different survey instruments in cross-sectional population studies from 1993 &#x 2013; 1994, 1999 &#x 2013; 2001 and 2005 &#x 2013; 2010 were compared with <b>import</b> <b>statistics</b> from the same years. Results. For cigarettes, survey results accounted for virtually the total import. Alcohol consumption was significantly under-reported with reporting completeness ranging from 40 % to 51 % for different estimates of habitual weekly consumption in the 3 study periods. Including an estimate of binge drinking increased the estimated total consumption to 78 % of the import. Conclusion. Compared with <b>import</b> <b>statistics,</b> questionnaire-based population surveys capture the consumption of cigarettes well in Greenland. Consumption of alcohol is under-reported, but asking about binge episodes in addition to the usual intake considerably increased the reported intake in this population and made it more in agreement with <b>import</b> <b>statistics.</b> It is unknown to what extent these findings at the population level can be inferred to population subgroups...|$|E

It should be noted that Eqs. (6) and (7) are based on the following respective assumptions: a domestic region’s sector that uses more domestic inputs of a specific good may use more of the same type of imported good as well, and a domestic region’s final demand item that consumes more of a specific good produced domestically may use more of the same type of imported good as well.

Methods: Commodity-level <b>import</b> <b>statistics,</b> household survey data and interviews with medical device sellers {{were used to assess}} the spread of diagnostic devices. Published qualitative evidence, case studies of diagnostic service providers and cross-country analyses were used for analyzing the reasons underlying the spread of medical devices in India.

Results: High-end medical device inflows rose during the 1990 s with both supply- and demand-side factors influencing this trend. Although our results suggest that the overall quantity of advanced diagnostics in India is not excessive, there is some evidence of inefficiency in public facilities and possibly unethical practices in private diagnostic facilities. The unequal geographical distribution of MRI facilities, coupled with inefficient use of medical devices in public facilities suggests inequality in access.
