Due to severe environment in the construction site, the chassis hydraulic system has high failure rate in the loader. Based on the criticality matrix analysis, some fatal failure modes were traced, including the leakage of motor, the pollution of hydraulic oil, the suction air of pump. Through the reliability prediction analysis, the estimated reliability of the chassis hydraulic system is 0. 27, and mean time between failures of the system is 183 h, in addition, critical components in the system are also determined. The above result could be used as reference for the optimization designing...|$|E

According to above mentioned standard is foreseen 1, 4 vehicle’s stability factor, which is calculated with corresponding software before manufacture of complete vehicle and only on fully assembled vehicle structural strength, safety and stability practical tests are carried out. The tests consist of static and dynamic tests, during which the stability of complete vehicle is tested and functionality of hydraulic and elector-hydraulic valves is checked. Tested objects are vehicle’s with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loader</b> crane mounted on rear part without additional stabilizers in front and software calculated stability factor. Stability factors according to the software in front and rear part of vehicle is more than minimum parameter that is required and on the side parts was too low.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study done}} on swinging and processing whole tree, tree length and log length pieces in a smallwood Douglas-fir thinning. Two machines were evaluated, a 70 horsepower rubber tired skidder and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loader</b> mounted on a 6 x 4 live tandem truck. The study {{took place in the}} foothills of the Coast Range in western Oregon. The stand averaged 217 trees/acre and 15 ft 3 /tree. Skidder and loader swinging occurred on rock surfaced truck roads. Both the loader and skidder were analyzed using work sampling and detailed time study techniques. Regression analysis was used to develop an equation to predict delay free turn time for the skidder. The whole tree/tree length skidder operation produced 2. 74 cunits/scheduled hour at 16. 45 /cunit for a two man crew and 22. 61 /cunit for a three man crew. There was no difference in production rates. A comparable two man log length operation produced 3. 41 cunits/scheduled hour at 23. 51 /cunit. This higher cost included limbing and bucking done at the stump. The whole tree/tree length loader operation produced 3. 21 cunits/scheduled hour at 16. 15 /cunit.

40|$|Time {{equations}} {{are derived}} for felling with chainsaw, skidding with cable wheeled skidder, loading with grapple <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loader</b> and trucking of logs within a cut-to-length harvesting method. The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 In {{order to}} {{appraise}} timber, {{it is necessary}} to estimate logging costs with reasonable accuracy. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a rethod for estimating log loading costs in the Intermountain Region. Nine different log loaders were studied loading from cold decks on six USDA. Forest Service timber sales in the Intermountain Region. Regression analysis indicated that loading time per truck was a linear function of pieces per truck. It also indicated a significant difference in loading times between hydraulic loaders and cable loaders. Regression analysis of sample truck scale data for each sale indicated that both the number of pieces loaded per truck and the volume per truck were functions of average piece size. The results also suggested that timber species affected volume per truck. The time study regression equation and the sample truck scale regression equations were combined to obtain production equations for both cable and hydraulic loaders as a function of average piece size. Then estimated owning and operating costs for a typical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loader</b> were combined with the production equation to obtain a relationship for loading costs per unit volume a a function of average piece size and hours of annual use. These costs were compared with costs obtained using the USDP Forest Service andbook (Forest Service, 1977). Results of this comparison indicated that the USDA Forest Service appraised loading costs did not vary nearly as much with average piece size as did the cost estimated in this paper...|$|E
40|$|In this study, three {{different}} processing options for trees yarded whole at the roadside in a beech thinning operation, {{typical of the}} Italian Apennine mountain, were studied. Trees were delimbed, crosscut, and stacked, respectively, by a four- man crew equipped with chainsaws and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loader</b> (motor-manual control thesis), by a small stroke harvester head mounted on a light excavator, and by a dedicated 6 -wheel harvester. Under {{the conditions of the}} study, mechanized processing was less expensive than the motor-manual control thesis, regardless of the specific option. Cost reductions amounted to 27 percent and 38 percent, respectively, for the light processor and the heavy harvester. Annual usage is a crucial factor for the introduction of industrial mechanization: the heavy harvester is preferable to motor-manual processing only when the annual output exceeds 5, 000 metric tonnes (t) per year. When this figure grows above 13, 000 tonnes per year, it will profitably replace the light processor, not just for monetary gain, but for the inability of the lighter unit to cope with such a heavy workload. On the other hand, the light processor was always less expensive than the motor-manual control, while requiring an additional investment of only (US) $ 47, 000. Therefore, the acquisition of a light processor represents the most viable option, at least for immediate deployment. Its productivity closely matches that of the yarder, allowing for hot-deck (synchronic) operation. All of the options can efficiently process beech trees within the full range of diameters normally obtained from thinning operations, and up to a 30 cm diameter at breast height. As expected, productivity increases with tree size, and even more so for the mechanical units, which normally handle just one or a few trees at a time. Under the conditions of this study, both mechanized options have a potential for bringing processing cost near (US) $ 10 per tonne, which is half the cost of traditional motor- manual processing...|$|E

40|$|The {{position}} control of <b>hydraulic</b> front end <b>loader</b> while dealing with unknown external load disturbances {{is the focus}} of this paper. The simulation results obtained show that the type- 2 fuzzy controller is capable of minimizing the position error of a front end loader’s bucket under load variations. This kind of hydraulic system is highly nonlinear due to factors such as leakage and friction. There are uncertainties in this system due to temperature dependence of bulk modulus and fluid viscosity. Such uncertainties together with the load variations cause chattering of the bucket position. Simulation results show for positional error of boom cylinder while varying the load in the bucket and also 50 to 150 % of variation in the nominal value of bulk modulus...|$|R

40|$|Truck loading {{operation}} {{is an important}} task during timber production operations in forestry. In Turkey, approximately 50 million timbers/logs are being produced per year, and then they are loaded into the logging trucks. The timber/logs are transported over the forest roads {{with an average of}} one million roundtrips. However, the traditional loading methods using manpower are mostly performed while some part is done by using loading machines which can be very costly and risky. This study aims developing a combined loading system in which heavy logs are loaded into logging trucks by pulling them by a log-line powered by a portable crane within the chute system. The slope of the log-line from ground to logging truck varied between 1 % and 25 %. Within the each work cycle of {{loading operation}}, only one log was loaded by pulling with portable crane. The average loading time was found as 161. 8 seconds per cycle, in which 67 % of the time was spent on pulling the log into the logging truck. The results indicated that the average pulling speed with crane power was 840. 4 m/hr and productivity was calculated as 4. 94 m 3 /hr. The result on system speed and productivity indicated close relations with results from previous studies. The <b>hydraulic</b> grapple <b>loader</b> or cranes are widely used and common loading machines, but they cannot be efficiently used in forestry operations, especially ones having a low timber productivity rate or having low economic value timber. In these conditions, loading methods that are cost efficient and do not require higher production rate should be employed. Therefore, a combined loading system introduced in this study can be a feasible solution for loading operations in those cases. Furthermore, it is believed that this loading system integrated with a portable crane can be cost efficient and time saving solution, as well as ergonomic and safe method in the field...|$|R
50|$|The IS-7 heavy {{tank was}} {{developed}} in 1948. Weighing 68 tonnes, thickly armoured and armed with a 130 mm S-70 long-barrelled gun, {{it was the largest}} and heaviest member of the IS family. The armour was engineered in a similar fashion to the IS-3, with a pike nose on the upper glacis. When shot at frontally, the extreme angle that the pike nose presents results in a much higher likelihood of a ricochet. Thus, the armour protection could be enhanced without having to use excessive amounts of materials. However, if the pike nose was shot at a sideways angle, it would not have a relative thickness high enough to ricochet the shell. In spite of its weight, it was easy to drive due to numerous <b>hydraulic</b> assists. The <b>loaders</b> noted that the IS-7 was comfortable and that the autoloader was easy to use. It was also able to achieve a top speed of 60 km/h thanks to a 1050-horsepower engine giving it a power to weight ratio of 15.4 hp/tonne, a ratio superior to most contemporary medium tanks. Its armour was not only immune to the Jagdtiger's 12.8 cm Pak 44 but was even proof to its own 130mm. Due to the reasons unknown, most likely because of the considerable issues arising from its mass (bridges, rail transport - no Soviet/Russian tank accepted into service afterwards exceeded 55 t), the tank never reached the production lines.|$|R
