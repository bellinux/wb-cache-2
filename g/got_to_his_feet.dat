5|$|After a {{disqualification}} in the 500m race, he {{was leading}} the skaters in the 1000m race. During a turn around the final corner, Ohno, Ahn Hyun Soo, Li Jiajun and Mathieu Turcotte all fell {{in a series of}} collisions. The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was trailing behind at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally was wearing skates, made by Bradbury's own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury had given them to Ohno, expecting for Ohno to win wearing them.|$|E
25|$|Fighting at It's Showtime in Amsterdam, Leko beat Badr Hari by {{spinning}} back kick in {{a grudge}} fight. Hari had trash talked Leko {{prior to the}} bout, and there was bad blood going in. Leko finished him in round 1, via spinning back kick to the liver. The fight had lasted little more than 100 seconds, with Badr throwing Leko across the ring from a clinch. Leko <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> calmly, and after a teep, landed his trademark spin-kick and it finished the fight. Hari stayed down for several minutes after the fight was waved off, in considerable pain.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then got back into the ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, and almost as soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to try to stay in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E
60|$|Reinhart <b>got</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and left}} the office. He hurried {{down the hall and}} out of the Council building.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} lawyer {{laid down the}} dead man in his blood upon the road, and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own <b>feet</b> {{with a kind of}} stagger.|$|R
60|$|It was broad {{daylight}} before they awoke. The sergeant <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{but it was}} evident to Edgar that he was altogether unfit for walking.|$|R
500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6â€“5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{arrived just}} before 1:00p.m. {{and was taken}} to Kerr's office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after {{the two men were}} seated, {{attempted}} to give it to Kerr. In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam that his commission as Prime Minister was withdrawn under Section64 of the Constitution, and handed him a letter and statement of reasons. Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> looked at the office's phones, and stated, [...] "I must {{get in touch with the}} Palace at once." [...] Whitlam, however disputed this, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then stated that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, [...] "You certainly will." [...] The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former Prime Minister took.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the match}} began, Hart and Michaels brought their {{performance}} outside {{the ring and}} into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As {{the climax of the}} match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top turnbuckle, sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a rake on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. Mike Chioda, the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme. Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter {{to break out of the}} hold. At that moment, Hebner <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, [...] "Ring the bell!" [...] McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, [...] "Ring the fucking bell!" [...] Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall. Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion. Michaels was ordered by McMahon to [...] "pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!" [...] Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway. McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment. Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace [...] "W-C-W" [...] and [...] "I love you" [...] to the cheering fans before returning backstage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing." [...] Sherikov <b>got</b> {{abruptly}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{closing the}} box carefully. [...] "Can I take this along? To my lab? I'd like to analyze it more fully." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>got</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>His</b> {{eyes were wide}} in astonishment. It never had {{occurred}} to the Prince of Helium that Thuvia of Ptarth might love another.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> unsteadily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> The waiter {{helped him}} {{on with his}} coat: and he put a disreputable-looking little curly hat on his head. Then he took his stick.|$|R
60|$|Gordon Atterbury {{had grown}} very pale. He, too, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then the Colonel <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and bowed}} to Stephen with ceremony.|$|E
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and strolled {{across the}} room with a sort of smiling embarrassment.|$|E
60|$|He ate rapidly, {{intent on}} the food. He {{did not look up}} until he was finished. Then he <b>got</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> wiping <b>his</b> mouth {{with the back of his}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|Thomas Cole <b>got</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as Steven {{came into}} view. [...] "Here," [...] Steven said. He dumped the food onto the curb, gasping for breath. [...] "Here's the food. Is it finished?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I beg of you, have mercy!" [...] cried Job Haskers, as he <b>got</b> unsteadily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "I--I--this {{was not my}} plan at all--Merwell {{suggested}} it. We--we {{were not}} going to--er--to steal anything." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and with}} the {{customary}} declaration of humble servitude bowed himself out.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Quayle <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in {{a mixture}} of sudden {{hysteria}} and clumsy presence of mind.|$|E

6000|$|Westerburg {{opened his}} eyes, looking up. He smiled and <b>got</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> a graceful, flowing motion that was rather {{surprising}} {{for a man}} of his size. [...] "Hello, Doctor. What brings you out here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Reinhart <b>got</b> unsteadily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "We {{better get}} to work. Start {{organizing}} construction teams. Exploration crews. We'll have to reconvert from war production to ship designing. Begin {{the manufacture of}} mining and scientific instruments for survey work." ...|$|R
60|$|Crack! {{the pistol}} sounded out again, {{and this time}} the {{mountain}} lion was hit in the neck. Over and over he rolled, but <b>got</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and, wounded as he was, prepared for another spring at our hero.|$|R
60|$|Unprotesting, Cole <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{allowing}} {{the doctor to}} take hold of his arm and help him up.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henry <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{and stood}} holding his chair. It was he {{that was like}} ashes now.|$|E
60|$|Jethro <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and turned}} his back on the {{storekeeper}} and picked up the parcel he had brought.|$|E
60|$|Roger crawled {{back again}} for some distance, and then threw himself down, and wept despairingly. He lay there for hours, until {{the heat of}} the sun, blazing almost {{vertically}} down, roused him. Then he <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and looked round.|$|R
6000|$|Cole <b>got</b> unsteadily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> He wiped <b>his</b> face shakily. His body ached and trembled. He spat {{a couple}} times, trying <b>to</b> clear <b>his</b> mouth. The plane would {{probably}} send in a report. People {{would be coming}} to look for him. Where could he go? ...|$|R
6000|$|The negro woke at {{the sound}} of his name. [...] "What is it?" [...] he asked. Receiving no reply, he <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> muttering, [...] "Some one call Sam, that for certain, can't do without Sam, always want here, want there. I go up and see." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{sound from}} the bed. Garvin had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and was staring wildly, with reddened lids.|$|E
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{with some}} alacrity, and his face, {{which was a}} little flushed, bore the marks of resolution.|$|E
60|$|Syme, who had {{sat down}} once more {{with his usual}} insolent languor, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with an unusual air of hesitation.|$|E
60|$|For a few minutes, {{there was}} a hot pursuit through the {{shrubbery}} and gardens, but nothing was discovered.

60|$|He <b>got</b> shakily <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>His</b> head spun. He was weak, shattered, {{trembling}} violently. The man {{was coming}} down the walk after him. Cole pulled himself onto the cart, gasping and retching. The horses jumped into life. Cole rolled over against the seat, sick with {{the motion of the}} swaying cart.|$|R
60|$|And {{while he}} was {{wondering}} what to do, {{and how to get}} the lady's knife back to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear, struggling to pick themselves up. Cole <b>got</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
