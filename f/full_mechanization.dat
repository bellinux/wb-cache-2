Julian Cunningham, was {{assigned}} to Fort Clark, where it trained until it was deployed for combat in the Pacific. Just before the 112th Cavalry left, the black Ninth United States Cavalry arrived at Fort Clark from Fort Riley. Elements of the regiment had first served at Fort Clark in 1875, when the fort was a frontier outpost. In 1942 Col. William C. Chase and the 113th Cavalry Regiment spent a short stay guarding the Southern Pacific Railroad. On February 25, 1943, the 2nd Cavalry Division, the army's last horse-mounted unit, was activated under command of Maj. Gen. Harry H. Johnson. Units of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed at Fort Clark included the 5th Cavalry Brigade (made up of the 9th and 27th US Cavalry Regiments). More than 12,000 troops were stationed there until their deployment in February 1944 to the European Theater of Operations. The war added another feature to the history of Fort Clark, that of having a German prisoner of war subcamp on the 4,000-acre reservation. Finally, in June 1944, nearly three years after the beginning of World War II, and after <b>full</b> <b>mechanization</b> of the cavalry, the government ordered the closure of Fort Clark, one of the last horse-cavalry posts in the country. The fort was officially inactivated in early 1946, and later that year it was sold to the Texas Railway Equipment Company of Houston, a subsidiary of Brown and Root Company, for salvage and later use as a [...] "Guest Ranch".|$|E
50|$|As {{the trees}} became {{established}} and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots {{up to six}} feet were removed. This process called brashing ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was pre-thinning this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as wolves were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At {{this time there was}} much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that racks or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a rack some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 <b>full</b> <b>mechanization</b> had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.|$|E

In the latter, we propose a new method, based on a separation-style logic, for reasoning about concurrent objects with such linearization points.

FCSL is the first completely formalized framework for mechanized verification of full functional correctness of fine-grained concurrent programs. It is implemented as an embedded domain-specific language (DSL) in the dependently-typed language of the Coq proof assistant, and is powerful enough to reason about programming features such as higher-order functions and local thread spawning. By incorporating a uniform concurrency model, based on state-transition systems and partial commutative monoids, FCSL makes it possible to build proofs about concurrent libraries in a thread-local, compositional way, thus facilitating scalability and reuse: libraries are verified just once, and their specifications are used ubiquitously in client-side reasoning...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanization}} {{of translation}} of texts from one language to another {{has been a}} great problem ever since linguists, computers and computer programs exist as such.

You can think of some basic, simple examples, even if you have never dealt with machine translation or linguistics, but you know at least two languages.

However, there is still a lack of information about its cultural practices. To this end, this research aimed to evaluate the influence of row spacing and plant population on the yield performance of biomass sorghum. The experimental design was a randomized block, in factorial scheme of 4 x 4, with four row spacings (0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 9 and 1. 1 m), and four plant populations (80, 000; 100, 000; 120, 000 and 140, 000 plants ha- 1), with three replications. The characteristics evaluated were: plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, number of tillers per plant, fresh weight per plant and biomass. Total biomass yield was greatly influenced by the row spacing, showing a sharp reduction when row spacing increased, in the two years of study, changing from 180. 27 to 114. 42 t ha- 1 in the 2012 / 13 crop year, and from 146. 50 to 102. 56 t ha- 1 in the 2013 / 14 crop year, for 0. 5 and 1. 1 m between rows, respectively.

40|$|Manual {{plucking}} {{is highly}} labour intensive, occupying almost 70 % {{of the total}} labour force on tea estates and accounting for approximately 40 - 45 % of cost of production. The high labour costs and shortages {{and the cost of}} production has resulted in tea (Camellia sinensis (L) O. Kuntze) industries in central and southern Africa becoming unprofitable. The solution to this problem has been the <b>full</b> <b>mechanization</b> of shoot harvesting, however, a reduction in yield and quality has been observed with mechanical harvesting. The overall aim {{of the study was to}} determine the causes of yield and quality decline in mechanically harvested tea and if higher nitrogen application rates could mitigate against the yield and quality decline. In order to achieve these aims, field experiments were carried out at Tingamira Estate, Chipinge, Zimbabwe and consisted of seven treatments laid out in a 2 x 3 factorial plus added control experiment, in a randomized complete block design replicated three times. Three harvesting methods (hand plucking performed every 10 / 11 days, hand-held and ride-on machines performed every 14 days) were tested against three fertilizer application rates (265, 300 and 400 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1), with hand plucking (265 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1) being the standard. The study showed that highest yields were produced under hand plucking (HP) across all seasons (43 945 kg green leaf ha- 1 yr- 1) as compared to hand-held (HHM; 35 114 kg green leaf ha- 1 yr- 1) and ride-on machines (ROM; 36 268 kg green leaf ha- 1 yr- 1 (p < 0. 05). Continuous mechanical harvesting therefore reduced yield, with yield declining between 17 % and 19 % compared to hand plucking over the three year pruning cycle. This reduction in yield was associated with a decrease in both the number and mass of desirable shoots in each season. This was largely due to the indiscriminate removal of foliage by the machines, which resulted in the proliferation of immature shoots, with an associated increase in sink strength and competition for available photo-assimilates. In addition, the maintenance layer was depleted in mechanically harvested bushes. This was indicated by reduced fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation in the top 10 cm in these bushes and reduced photosynthetic rates in these bushes. This suggests that these bushes were also source limited, as compared to hand plucked bushes. Therefore the changes in tea bush architecture, as a result of mechanical harvesting, resulted in changes in sink/source dynamics, which led to a proliferation of immature shoots which competed for limited photo-assimilates. The decline in yield in mechanically harvested tea has also been associated with a decline in tea quality. In this study hand plucking resulted in a higher % of good leaf quality compared to machine harvesting treatments in the first two seasons, irrespective of N application rate. However, in the third season there were no differences in % good leaf between treatments. Tea tasters' assessments in the third season also showed that there were no significant differences in liquor colour and strength, briskness, brightness and total tea tasters' valuation between hand plucking and mechanical harvesting. However, seasonal differences were observed with higher scores and valuation being observed in the off - season (May 2013), as compared to the main growing period (February 2013). High N-rates tended to reduce made tea density and % fibre content under machine harvesting, but there were no significant differences between treatments. Based on organoleptic evaluation scores and taking hand plucking as a standard for good quality, the harvesting techniques did not show any differences in quality. An analysis of biochemical compounds, important for black tea quality, in tea from February 2013 and May 2013 showed no difference between harvesting techniques and N-application rates. However the dimers and trimers of smaller catechins produced during harvesting initiating field fermentation increased in mechanically harvested bushes and with higher N-application rates, as compared to hand plucking. This could possibly have improved quality in mechanically harvested teas. Based on these results mechanical harvesting can be used as an alternative to hand plucking, as it does not adversely affect black tea quality as previous believed.

40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} land levelling under {{authorization of}} cross compliance prohibits farmers from levelling land through bulldozing without a specific permission {{issued by the}} proper territorial authority. The aim of the standard is to ensure the protection of soil from accelerated erosion that almost always occurs when land is levelled without conservative criteria. Land levelling prior to planting or replanting specialized crops, especially orchards, is indicated by agronomists as essential to the <b>full</b> <b>mechanization</b> of cultivation and harvesting operations {{and the success of}} economic investment. Land levelling leads to a deep modification of the hill slopes, so it may produce serious damage to the environment if carried out {{in the absence of a}} carefully planned design. In other words, a design that takes the aspects of soil conservation into account, especially for steep hill slopes where the insite and offsite environmental impacts of soil erosion may be more pronounced. With regard to the areas involved, land levelling plays a key role on a national scale, one only needs to think of the vineyards planted on the countryâ€™s hill slopes, which in 1970 covered an area of 793, 000 hectares. Moreover, despite the continued reduction in areas planted with vines, from 1990 to 2002 the area devoted to DOC and DOCG wines increased by about 29 % and the average size of vineyards has also increased. This is a clear sign of the current trend, with the transition from the family model to the industrial model of orchard management, with extensive use of machinery and thus the use of bulldozers for levelling. The authorization topic, on which the standard of compliance is based, is analysed in detail. In summary we can say that, according to law, the permit required by the GAEC standard is currently mandatory only for those areas subject to the Hydrogeological constraint (Royal decree 30 December 1923 No. 3267) and for parks or other areas for which the regional regulations are more rigorous. Land levelling in other agricultural areas is excluded from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. Owners are only required to submit a DIA (statement of commencement of activity) to the Public Authority. However, permission is granted by law, in the event of lack of ruling by the Authority (implicit consent principle). This GAEC standard assumes that permission (where due) granted by the local authorities responsible for territorial governance is sufficient to avoid the damage that could be caused by land levelling. In other words, the standard does not dictate the agronomic rules to be followed in carrying out land levelling, but refers to already existing local rules and assumes that the authorization is granted on the basis of a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). At the present time, only a few local governments take land levelling into consideration in their territorial governance legislation. In general, there is no rule requiring that the application for authorization be accompanied by a project containing the items considered necessary, in the present study, to enable the authorities to express well-pondered judgment. In addition, local territorial rules do not require the execution of land levelling and subsequent approval of the finished work to be carried out under the supervision of a geologist or a pedologist. At present, the GAEC standard is very weak, due to the lack of coordination between the provisions of cross compliance and territorial governance legislation focused on land levelling. It is common practice for the landowner, after obtaining permission, to assign the work to an earthmoving company with no expertise in soil protection and which possibly also has an interest in moving large volumes of earth. This may contribute to an increase in severe environmental damage. Land levelling, undertaken by virtue of a simple DIA and lacking environmental expertise, is very risky and can cause severe damage to soil resources and the landscape. This is particularly true in areas prone to hydrogeological risk or where the soil is thin or fragile in relation to some of its qualities or environmental functions. The results of some researchers on Italian case studies have shown the extent to which land levelling undertaken disregarding the rules of environmental protection can cause serious disturbance to the soil resource, resulting in impressive truncation or burial of the original soil profile, with severe reduction in land capability, even to the extent of desertification. Results showed that there was a drop in production, especially in excavation areas. Furthermore, changes in the quality of products and a general decay in the vegetative state of plants and water stress were observed. In one case study, land levelling performed before planting a vineyard determined excavation and accumulation thicknesses respectively up to 19 and 16 metres. In another case study soil erosion after land levelling reached values of over 300 Mg ha- 1 (classified as catastrophic erosion). This value is far from the limits of a tolerable erosion of 6 - 11 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 currently internationally accepted. The proposals to update the GAEC standard are as follows: i) extension of the land levelling under authorization rule to include also land remodelling (light bulldozing following the removal of an old plantation, to prepare the land for a new plantation); ii) obligation to submit a geological and pedological feasibility study in order to obtain authorization...|$|E
