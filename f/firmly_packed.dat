"Sire: I address your Majesty {{from a point}} 430 coprets {{vertically}} {{above the}} site of the famous ancient city of Buffalo, once the capital of a powerful nation called the Smugwumps. I can approach no nearer because of the hardness of the snow, which is very <b>firmly</b> <b>packed.</b> For hundreds of prastams in every direction, and for thousands to the north and west, the land is covered with this substance, which, as your Majesty is doubtless aware, is extremely cold to the touch, but by application of sufficient heat can be turned into water. It falls from the heavens, and is believed by the learned among your Majesty's subjects to have a sidereal origin.|$|E

30|$|MWCNT- and DWCNT-modified GCPE were {{prepared}} by hand-mixing of 4 % of nanotubes with 66 % GC μ-particles and 30 % mineral oil. Plain GCPE was prepared by mixing 80 % GC μ-particles with 20 % mineral oil. These are the optimum amount of composite electrode structure that was optimized {{in an earlier}} publication [21]. A portion of the resulting paste was then <b>packed</b> <b>firmly</b> into the electrode cavity (3.0 mm diameter and 5 mm depth) of a PTFE sieve. Electrical contact was established via a copper wire.

The surface of the electrode was smoothed against weighing paper and rinsed with water. The paste was carefully removed prior to pressing a new portion in to the electrode after every measurement. The resulting electrode was noted as CPE. Prior to use, the CPE was activated in phosphate buffer solution of pH 7 by cyclic voltammetric sweeps between 0.4 and 1.4  V with a scan rate 50  mVS− 1 (Malode S.J. et al. 2013).|$|R

The lens fibers are linked together via gap junctions and interdigitations of the cells that resemble [...] "ball and socket" [...] forms.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the Irkutsk HPS {{began in}} February 1950 and was {{conducted}} by Angaragesstroy with Anton Melnikonis managing. Andrey Efimovich Bochkin served as the Chief of Angaragesstroy and Sergey Nikandrovich Moiseyev was appointed Chief Engineer. At the time, such a large rock-fill dam was unprecedented {{in the world and}} brought difficulties in designing and construction. Earthquakes in the area could reach a magnitude of 8, so the dam needed to be earth-fill and <b>packed</b> <b>firmly.</b> In addition, the cold temperatures and flooding of the river made construction and concrete settling difficult. In June 1954, the foundation stone for the dam was laid and concrete pouring began soon after. On July 7, 1956, the river was cut off to allow the filling of the Irkutsk Dam's reservoir and on December 29 of that same year, its first generator began to produce electricity. By December 31, a second generator was operational.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{stated that}} [...] "the {{reactive}} forces of incendiaries were probably not {{applied to the}} propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century". A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes (abbreviated as The Book of Fires). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth {{to the end of}} the thirteenth centuries—two of which are rockets. The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in laurel oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to [...] "fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything". The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter—all finely powdered on a marble slab.

40|$|We {{normally}} live in symbiosis with ∼ 1013 bacteria {{present in}} the colon. Among the several mechanisms maintaining the bacteria/host balance, there is limited understanding of the structure, function, and properties of intestinal mucus. We now demonstrate that the mouse colonic mucus consists of two layers extending 150 μm above the epithelial cells. Proteomics revealed that both of these layers have similar protein composition, with the large gel-forming mucin Muc 2 as the major structural component. The inner layer is densely <b>packed,</b> <b>firmly</b> attached to the epithelium, and devoid of bacteria. In contrast, the outer layer is movable, has an expanded volume due to proteolytic cleavages of the Muc 2 mucin, and is colonized by bacteria. Muc 2 −/− mice have bacteria {{in direct contact with}} the epithelial cells and far down in the crypts, explaining the inflammation and cancer development observed in these animals. These findings show that the Muc 2 mucin can build a mucus barrier that separates bacteria from the colon epithelia and suggest that defects in this mucus can cause colon inflammation...|$|R
50|$|A shared-use path or mixed-use path {{is a form}} of {{infrastructure}} that supports multiple recreation and transportation opportunities, such as walking, bicycling, inline skating and people in wheelchairs. Motorcycles and mopeds are normally prohibited. A shared-use path typically has a surface that is asphalt, concrete or <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> crushed aggregate. In the U.S., the 1999 AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities defines a shared-use path as being physically separated from motor vehicular traffic with an open space or barrier. Shared-use paths differ from exclusive bikeways in that shared-use paths are designed to include pedestrians even if the primary anticipated users are cyclists. Some shared paths have been built as rail trails.|$|E
5000|$|Ponticola gorlap, or the Caspian bighead goby, is {{a species}} of goby, a benthic fish native to the Caspian Sea basin. It is {{widespread}} in lower parts of many rivers in Iran, and also found in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. In Russia, it occurred in the lowest part of the Volga River up to Astrakhan until 1977, but has thereafter spread upstream. In 2000 it was recorded as being established in the Ivankovo and Rybinsk Reservoirs in the Moscow region, and already invaded the Don drainage {{by way of the}} Volga-Don Canal in 1972. [...] This species occurs in sheltered environments, such as inshore fresh or brackish waters of estuaries, lagoons, lakes and large rivers, where it prefers habitats with a well vegetated rock or <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> sand substrate. It can reach a length of 20 cm SL, and a common size is 12 cm SL.|$|E
5000|$|Okara that is <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> {{consists}} of 3.5 to 4.0% protein, 76 to 80% moisture and 20 to 24% of solids. When moisture free, the gritty okara contains 8 to 15% fats, 12 to 14.5% crude fiber and 24% protein, and contains 17% of the protein {{from the source}} soybeans. It also contains potassium, calcium, niacin. Most of the soybean isoflavones are left in okara, as well as vitamin B and the fat-soluble nutritional factors, which include soy lecithin, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, phytosterols, tocopherol, and vitamin D. [...] Okara contains some antinutritional factors: trypsin inhibitors (mostly destroyed by cooking), saponins, and hemagglutinin, which cannot be easily digested. Fermentation (by proper species of bacteria) of okara is not only conducive to digestion and absorption of okara nutrients, but also further improves the nutritional value. It can eliminate the bean’s sense of smell, {{increase the amount of}} edible fiber, free amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin B2, and flavoprotein.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} section of the GWR, from London Paddington station to a {{temporary}} station at [...] known as 'Maidenhead Bridge', Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles so that the gravel ballast (which was necessary on all railways for drainage) could be <b>packed</b> very <b>firmly.</b> It was <b>packed</b> so <b>firmly,</b> in fact, that the track was forced upwards between the piles and thus gave an undulating ride, just the thing that Brunel had tried to address by using continuous bearings and firm packing.

40|$|TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Mechanism of formation: • Plant hairs are {{apparently}} poorly digested by ruminal micro-organisms and accumulate in especially the abomasum. • Here {{under the influence}} of abomasal movement, innumerable hairs conglomerate (possibly around a small milk clot as nucleus) and felt together <b>firmly</b> in <b>packed,</b> dense layers to form balls of various shapes and 10 to 150 mm in diameter. • Up to 30 balls might be present in the abomasum. SYNDROMES: Intestinal hair balls originating from plants. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal system. CLINICAL SIGNS: Goats are more often affected than sheep and clinical signs and death occur in the age group 3 - 15 months. • Inappetance • Slow progressive loss in condition • Ruminal stasis • Distended abdomen (gas, hair balls) • Faeces - foul smelling and scanty. NECROPSY: • Emaciation, cachexia • Fore-stomachs thin-walled, papillae atrophied, contents watery, foul-smelling. • Bezoars in abomasum • Signs of rupture of abomasum or intestine may be seen. TREATMENT: • Purgatives are ineffective • Balls too firm to break manually • Surgery - consider cost effectiveness • Diagnose through palpation of abdomen and slaughter before too much condition is lost. PREVENTION: Avoid exposure of lambs to only seradella pastures or camps with causative plants especially during periods when pappus hairs are prevalent. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG.

5000|$|The rampart {{was built}} a {{considerable}} time {{later than the}} original timber palisade that defended the early settlement.

5000|$|Individuals of {{this species}} vary in size from 5-50 cm. Actinostachys pennula ferns range from small sizes living near decomposing leaf and tree matter to larger sizes with ones that live in places that are {{abundant}} in sunlight and are in wide open areas. It is a non-grass herb. The roots are dark and covered with rigid black hairs that are 2-3 mm in length. The rhizome is considered hairy and bristly due to these features. The stems are upright with their hairs in a single line. The stem of the Actinostachys pennula is not a singular structure. The stem is composed of many tiny, narrow stems that are commonly less than 1 mm in diameter. They reproduce rapidly from bases of old leaves. Thus, the stem bears more of a resemblance to a <b>firmly</b> <b>packed,</b> inter-grown bush than a solitary stem. Actinostachys pennula has leaves related to the stem in a cauline design {{which has not been}} observed in any other fern present today. Leaves are like grass and are 1-60 mm in length. The leaves are all fertile, do not have branches, and have long petioles that are [...]5-2 cm in length. The blades of the leaves have rays that are on very short rachis which give the false impression of a whorl-like pattern. The rays can range from 1-12 mm or 4-40 mm in length. All new leaves for the Actinostachys pennula are built from the base of leaves already produced by the plant. The mass of curly petioles gives Actinostachys pennula its nickname as the tropical curly grass plant. There is no main shoot apex as one leaf is produced from the previous one.|$|E

Teleostei, Mugilidae,mullet, Mugi! curema, ultrastructure, spermatozoa ln recent years, researchers have beco me increasingly interested in the ultrastrutural analysis of the Teleostei spermatozoa due to their wide variety of forms and structures. Studies on the male gametes of five fish species belonging to the family Mugilidae revealed the existence of morphological intergeneric and interspecies. differences (VAN HORST & CROSS, 1978; BRUSLE, 1981; EIRAS-STOFELLA & GREMSKI, 1991), which emphasized the point made by other authors who believe that this type of analysis is capable of distinguishing fishes of a sarne family even at specific levei (MA TTEI et ai., 1967; BACCETI et ai., 1984; MATTEI, 1991). We now report results of ultrastructural analysis of the Mugil curema Valenciennes, 1836 spermatozoa in order to compare their morphology with that of other Mugilidae fishes...|$|E
40|$|Soil color {{originates}} {{mainly from}} organic matter, iron mineralogy and moisture content. We aimed {{to find a}} suitable method to measure soil color sensitively and to evaluate {{the extent to which}} the color parameters can be useful for statistically estimating total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and active iron (Fe) contents in Japanese agricultural soils. A soil color reader (SPAD- 503) was applied to two sample sets: (1) 100 surface soils collected throughout a 0. 5 -ha paddy field (field scale) and (2) 147 surface soils collected from agricultural fields in Japan (national scale). For analysis with this instrument, about 2 g of air-dried, finely-ground samples were <b>packed</b> <b>firmly</b> in a plastic cell, and their colors as they appeared on windows in both sides of the cell were measured. A CIE 1976 (L[*], a[*], b[*]) color space was used for color description. For the field-scale samples, the values of the coefficient of variation were around 15 % for total C, total N and acid oxalate extractable iron (Feo). The L[*] value (lightness) was negatively correlated with the content of total C and total N (R[2] = 0. 18 ** and 0. 26 **, respectively), and the b[*] value (yellowness) was positively correlated with the Feo content (R[2] = 0. 59 [**]). For the national-scale samples, the values of the coefficient of variation were around 60 % for total C, total N and Feo. The L[*] value was negatively correlated with the content of total C and total N (R[2] = 0. 70 ** and 0. 59 [**], respectively), but the b[*] value was not correlated with the content of Feo (R[2] = 0. 00). When the analysis was limited to 65 samples frequently used for paddy fields, the b[*] value was positively correlated with the Feo content (R[2] = 0. 52 [**]). In conclusion, the proposed method enabled us to measure soil color sensitively with a small sample size. The L[*] and b[*] values obtained can be useful for rapid estimation of total C, total N and Feo contents in agricultural surface soils in Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of previous experimental work {{made on the}} simulation of stromatactis-like cavities in rapidly settling suspensions of particulate matter substantiates the continuation of experiments toward identifying the conditions of cavity formation. It {{has been suggested that}} the most promising directions in this experimental work involve the simplification of complex factors (e. g. , variables that derive from the properties of particles and media, as well as the sedimentation dynamics of slurries). Our new hydrodynamic concept of stromatactis formation addresses the traditional key arguments of previous authors on the origins of stromatactis systems. The direct production of stromatactis-type cavities during the sedimentation of fine particulate, polydisperse, multimodal aquatic suspended matter can be characterized in terms of competition between fluids escaping from compressed, diluted domains, and the dynamic effects of the dense packing of solid particles on their boundaries, the latter gradually overtaking from the former, until a middle layer of sediment is sufficiently stabilized and the first internal sedimentation from residual suspensions begins. With the earliest stabilization of the grain-supported, skeleton-like structures in the sediment, low domical but surprisingly stable vaults develop above the cavity zones. Underneath the coalescing arched structures, there often remain places in which grains can still be fluidized, and which consequently enable the further widening of these primary cavities. The specific grain size distribution is derived from natural counterparts, an attribute combined with the high internal friction angle, and increases the final sediment cohesion and stability. This process is particularly effective when highly polydisperse-multimodal sediment materials have highly angular, rugged, or potentially cohesive grains. When the relatively coarsest- and finest-grained fractions are present in increased amounts, the energy dissipation of the dense turbulent slurry is enhanced, and the stromatactis-producing mid-layer is gradually sealed by a relatively impermeable, non-stromatactis, very fine-grained cover in {{the upper part of the}} deposit. Two categories of experiments are discussed in this paper. The first is aimed at explaining how moderately large particles can interact with each other. In this category of experiments, moderately graded tridisperse mixtures of angular or highly textured particles tended to produce <b>firmly</b> <b>packed</b> clusters with ensuing domical vaulting above cavities. The second group of experiments is based on combinations of bidisperse mixtures of large grains with polydisperse nearly-unimodal matrices of small angular grains. These two components, if used separately, have close to zero capacity for producing any type of stromatactis-like cavities. However, once they were combined, even modest amounts of these large grains led to the growth of spacious cavity systems, particularly if artificial crinoid columnals were present. The comparison of our experimental results with natural examples suggest that crinoid columnals must be regarded as an important, although not indispensable accelerator of stromatactis cavity production...|$|E
