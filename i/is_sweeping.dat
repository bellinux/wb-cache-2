Ben finds a television, and they watch an {{emergency}} broadcaster (Charles Craig) report that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming {{the flesh of the}} living. Experts, scientists, and the United States military fail to discover the cause, though one scientist suspects radioactive contamination from a space probe. It returned from Venus, and was deliberately exploded in the Earth's atmosphere when the radiation was detected.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago, the Apprentice (Timothy Webber) <b>is</b> <b>sweeping</b> a vault, when an unknown Dark One intrudes, later {{revealed}} to be Zoso. The Dark One knocks him aside and attempts to open a box, but is repelled by an enchantment placed on it by The Sorcerer. The Apprentice tells the Dark One that the box cannot be opened by someone who has succumbed to the darkness in their heart. The Dark One vanishes in a rage, and the Apprentice says that no Dark One will ever open the box.|$|E
500|$|Mainstream {{periodicals}} {{tended to}} be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book The Cultural Creatives, what they called the media's [...] "zest for attacking" [...] New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 Lance Morrow essay in Time magazine. Nearly a decade earlier, Time had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, [...] "Om.... THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore". [...] The story itself, by former Saturday Evening Post editor Otto Friedrich, was sub-titled, [...] "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition <b>Is</b> <b>Sweeping</b> Across the Country". [...] In 1988, the magazine The New Republic ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist Richard Blow entitled simply, [...] "Moronic Convergence".|$|E

500|$|In early November 2011, Architects {{announced}} {{a plan to}} release [...] "Devil's Island", the first song from the then-unnamed follow-up to their fourth studio album The Here and Now. They released it on 4 December 2011, with a b-side song called [...] "Untitled". Both the song and the accompanying music video reference rioting in England in 2011, and the music video features clips of the riots. [...] "Devil's Island" [...] was well received by critics for its return to the mathcore style of their third album, Hollow Crown. Thrash Hits said, [...] "more-melodic aspects of Architects are still very much on show", that the song used [...] "increased harsh vocals" [...] and that the guitar tones were reminiscent of those on [...] "Early Grave", the opening track of Hollow Crown. J.J. Nattrass of Bring The Noise said, [...] "the track <b>is</b> <b>sweeping</b> and melodic in parts, whilst bursting with high tempo and visceral raw energy in others." [...] Tim Dodderidge, writing for Mind Equals Blown, praised the song's lyrics, saying, [...] "Architects has taken on an important issue in Britain today and made a song that questions humanity; it may have a lasting effect on listeners that bands like Rise Against {{have been able to}} do, though they sound nothing alike". The band supported the single's release with a five-day UK headline tour in December 2011; supporting acts were Deaf Havana, Tek-One and Heights.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2012 captive Tasmanian devils were {{introduced}} to the island and are cared for by the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service staff who live on the island.

Because Maria Island's devils are subject to strict quarantine, visitors to the island are not able to see or interact with them.

2500|$|The soundtrack to Woody Allen's 1979 film Manhattan is {{composed}} entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including Rhapsody in Blue, [...] "Love <b>is</b> <b>Sweeping</b> the Country", and [...] "But Not for Me", performed {{by both the}} New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas. The film begins with a monologue by Allen: [...] "He adored New York City ...

2500|$|Flat {{taxes have}} also been {{considered}} in the United Kingdom by the Conservative Party. In September 2005, George Osborne, then in opposition, said {{that while he was}} [...] "fully conscious that {{we may not be able}} to introduce a pure flat tax, we may be able to move towards simpler and flatter taxes." [...] However, it was roundly rejected by Gordon Brown, then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it was [...] "An idea that they say <b>is</b> <b>sweeping</b> the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia", and criticised it thus: [...] "The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the home help, the worker on the minimum wage".|$|E
2500|$|The Saints {{resisted}} being re-modelled {{into the}} English punk look and were generally {{ignored by the}} Australian press. Mainstream public was warned that punk rock is [...] "a sinister new teenage pop cult, based on sex, sadism and violence, [...] <b>is</b> <b>sweeping</b> Britain." [...] In May 1977, the band released their second single, [...] "Erotic Neurotic" [...] and then moved to the UK, where they differed with their label over how they should be marketed. EMI planned to promote them as a typical punk band, complete with ripped clothes and spiky hair â€“ The Saints insisted on maintaining a more downbeat image. In June, bass guitarist Alasdair [...] "Algy" [...] Ward replaced Bradshaw. Their next single [...] "This Perfect Day" [...] (July) peaked at No.34 in the UK but further improvement was frustrated by EMI's failure to press enough copies to satisfy demand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{song was}} played by {{influential}} DJ John Peel {{in a special}} punk-themed edition of his BBC Radio 1 programme, broadcast on 10 December 1976. Bob Geldof of The Boomtown Rats later said, [...] "Rock music in the Seventies was changed by three bandsthe Sex Pistols, the Ramones and The Saints". EMI Records in Sydney was contacted by its London head office and told to sign the punk band from Brisbane. The Saints resisted being re-modelled into the English punk look and were generally ignored by the Australian press at the time, which reported that [...] "a sinister new teenage pop cult, based on sex, sadism and violence, <b>is</b> <b>sweeping</b> Britain." [...] They relocated first to Sydney and then to London, where they were received with excitement on their first regional tour. They did not share the spiky-topped, safety-pinned style of the leading UK punk groups and preferred to be described as [...] "gutsy realists".
