5000|$|The fifth episode [...] "Hardwired" [...] {{was widely}} noted for {{confirming}} that B. D. Wong's character George Huang is gay. Neal Baer considered the revelation {{to be nothing}} special and summarized [...] "Have the writers always thought he was gay? Yes. Have they avoided saying it? No. It’s sort of been implied. But it doesn’t really {{come up in the}} work place unless it comes up." [...] Huang was led to this comment because characters in the episode who tried to lobby in favor of adult-child sexual relationships compared their situation to the persecution of homosexuals. To describe the episode, Baer said [...] "'Is pedophilia hardwired?'...

30|$|Another {{important}} {{benefit of}} walking around {{is that it}} helped keep students on task, reducing {{the need for more}} direct confrontation. For example, Benjamin commented that his StRIP student survey results indicated that he confronted students seldom because “It’s more like walking around, and then you go to a team and you ask them, ‘How are <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> that?’” Thus, as these instructor comments indicate, walking around served multiple purposes.|$|R

500|$|Campbell {{was seen}} refusing to shake Rooney's {{hand at the}} final whistle {{and there were no}} {{customary}} shirt swaps between both sets of players; it was alleged that the Arsenal players wore T-shirts emblazoned with [...] "50 not out", though this has never been proven. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel in front of police officers. Several Arsenal players were held back, one of whom was Henry, incensed that Ferdinand claimed the man-of-the-match award. The conflict sparked into life when Wenger confronted Van Nistelrooy as he was unhappy with the striker's challenge on Cole. Ferguson intervened and told Wenger to leave his players alone, but the Arsenal manager faced him and said [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|As Miss Grammont and Sir Richmond Hardy {{fulfilled}} {{the details of}} his excellent programme and revised their impressions of the past and their ideas about the future in the springtime sunlight of Wiltshire and Somerset, with Miss Seyffert acting the part of an almost ostentatiously discreet chorus, it was inevitable that their conversation should become, by imperceptible gradations, more personal and intimate. They kept up the pose, which was supposed to represent Dr. Martineau's philosophy, of being Man and Woman on their Planet considering its Future, but insensibly they developed the idiosyncrasies of their position. They might profess to be Man and Woman in the most general terms, but the facts that she was the daughter not of Everyman but old Grammont and that Sir Richmond was the angry leader of a minority upon the Fuel Commission became more and more important. [...] "What shall we do with this planet of ours?"

60|$|It {{happened}} that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere, {{so that the}} task of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell upon Katharine. She took her letter to Cassandra with her, meaning to post {{it in the first}} pillar-box she came to. When, however, she was fairly out of doors, and constantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats, she forbore. She made absurd excuses, as that she did not wish to cross the road, or that she was certain to pass another post-office in a more central position a little farther on. The longer she held the letter in her hand, however, the more persistently certain questions pressed upon her, as if from a collection of voices in the air. These invisible people wished to be informed whether she was engaged to William Rodney, or was the engagement broken off? Was it right, they asked, to invite Cassandra for a visit, and was William Rodney in love with her, or likely to fall in love? Then the questioners paused for a moment, and resumed as if another side of the problem had just come to their notice. What did Ralph Denham mean by what he said to <b>you</b> last night? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> consider that he is in love with you? Is it right to consent to a solitary walk with him, and what advice are you going to give him about his future?
