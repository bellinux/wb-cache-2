The evaluated algorithms are model predictive control (MPC) and inverse dynamics in the virtual domain (IDVD). A linear–quadratic approach with a quadratic programming solver {{is used for the}} MPC approach. A nonconvex optimization problem results from the IDVD approach, and a nonlinear programming solver is used. The docking scenario is constrained by the presence of a keep-out zone, an <b>entry</b> <b>cone,</b> and by the chaser’s maximum actuation level. The performance metrics for the experiments and numerical simulations include the required control effort and time to dock.

Using a variety of cone angles and liquid physical properties, we show that the ejecta formed during the impact exhibits self-similarity for all impact speeds for very low surface tension liquids, whilst for high-surface tension liquids similarity is only achieved at high impact speeds. We find that the ejecta tip can detach from the cone and that this phenomenon {{can be attributed to}} the air entrainment phenomenon. We analyse of a range of cone angles, including some ogive cones, and impact speeds in terms of the spatiotemporal evolution of the ejecta tip.

40|$|The Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina initiates {{more than}} 85 % of fly strikes on sheep in Australia with an {{estimated}} average annual cost of A$ 280 million to the Australian wool industry. LuciTrap® is a commercially available, selective trap for L. cuprina consisting of a plastic bucket with multiple fly <b>entry</b> <b>cones</b> and a synthetic attractant. The impact of LuciTrap on populations of L. cuprina on sheep properties in five Australian states was evaluated by comparing L. cuprina populations on paired properties with and without LuciTraps over seasons when significant fly populations could be expected. Twenty-four comparisons (trials) were conducted over four years. During times of ‘higher fly density’ (when the 48 h geometric mean of trap catches on the control property was greater than five L. cuprina), the overall geometric mean trap catches for control and trapped properties differed significantly (P< 0. 001) with mean trap catches of 19. 4 and 7. 74 L. cuprina respectively. The selectivity of the LuciTrap was confirmed with 59 % of all trapped flies being L. cuprina. Chrysomya spp. and Calliphora spp. constituted 9. 3 % and 1. 1 % of the catches {{with a variety of}} other flies (mainly Sarcophagidae and Muscidae) providing the remainder (31 %). L. sericata was only trapped in Tasmania and made up 7. 7 % of the Lucilia spp. catch in this State. Seventy-two percent of the trapped L. cuprina were female. The deployment of LuciTrap on sheep properties at one trap per 100 sheep {{from the beginning of the}} anticipated fly season suppressed the populations of L. cuprina by 60 % compared to matched control properties. The LuciTrap is a selective and easy to use fly trap and constitutes an effective, non-insecticidal tool for use in integrated management programs for L. cuprina...|$|R

Using Oyane ductile {{fracture}} criterion, a 2 -D coupled thermo-mechanical simulation of center crack occurrence in round billet during 2 -roll rotary rolling process is {{presented with the}} aid of FE code MSC.

40|$|To be {{published}} in the proceedings of the 27 th AAS/AIAA Spaceflight Mechanics Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Feb. 6 - 9, 2017 In this paper, we develop a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach for spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD) with a rotating target platform. A strategy to enforce and handle constraints is proposed for collision-free and soft docking while real-time computation is achieved. In the strategy, constraints on thrust, spacecraft positioning within the <b>entry</b> <b>cone</b> from the docking port, and collision avoidance are systemically treated and switched in two-phase spacecraft RVD maneuvering. Dynamically reconfigurable constraints with a switching algorithm are introduced to guide the chaser spacecraft into the docking port in the final docking phase. The performance of the developed NMPC controller is analyzed for test cases using a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulator. The controller is also implemented on an air-bearing test bed to demonstrate the capability to perform real-time computation and to satisfy constraints...|$|E

This novel method of x-ray radiography features high temporal resolution, high signal to noise ratio and monochromatic imaging. We present here the Ti K-alpha backlit images of a series of six-beam driven spherical implosions of thin-walled 500 micron Cu doped CD shells. These images, separated by ∼ 0. 5 ns intervals, capture various states of implosion in and around a stagnation time observed to be ∼ 3. 25 ns. Images of imploding coned Cu doped CD shells used in fast ignition research are additionally presented. These images, taken near the previously determined stagnation time, show an imploded core collapsed around an attached gold laser <b>entry</b> <b>cone.</b> These radiographic results were linked to a study of fast electron transport within imploded Cu doped coned CD shells as a result of interaction with a high intensity, short pulse laser.

40|$|SummaryRod-derived cone {{viability}} factor (RdCVF) is an inactive thioredoxin secreted by rod photoreceptors {{that protects}} cones from degeneration. Because the secondary loss of cones in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) leads to blindness, {{the administration of}} RdCVF is a promising therapy for this untreatable neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the protective role of RdCVF in RP. We show that RdCVF acts through binding to Basigin- 1 (BSG 1), a transmembrane protein expressed specifically by photoreceptors. BSG 1 binds to the glucose transporter GLUT 1, resulting in increased glucose <b>entry</b> into <b>cones.</b> Increased glucose promotes cone survival by stimulation of aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, a missense mutation of RdCVF results in its inability to bind to BSG 1, stimulate glucose uptake, and prevent secondary cone death in a model of RP. Our data uncover an entirely novel mechanism of neuroprotection through the stimulation of glucose metabolism...|$|R

METHODS: We equipped each HC MV (n 5) with an 8. 0 mm diameter endotracheal tube (ETT), locating the HC MV in the inspiratory limb of a breathing circuit linked to a mechanical ventilator set to simulate tidal breathing at tidal volume 830 mL, respiratory rate 15 breaths/min, inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1 : 2. 1, peak inspiratory pressure 20 cm H 2 O. Temperature and humidity settings were 351 °C and 100 % relative humidity (close to body conditions). We compared delivery of 5 -ac-tuations of CFC- and HFA-BDP (both 50 g/actuation), measuring total emitted mass captured by a filter at the distal end of the ETT. In a separate study, we inserted the distal end of the ETT within the <b>entry</b> <b>cone</b> of a cascade impactor so that the aerosol particle size distribution could be determined with the circuit at similar environmental conditions as described previously. We made benchmark measure-ments with circuit temperature and humidity at room ambient conditions (211 °C and 545 % RH respectively).

40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} {{implications}} of lowering electricity sector CO 2 emissions in PJM through a Low Carbon Capacity Standard (LCCS) instead of a renewables portfolio standard (RPS). An LCCS would create a requirement for load-serving entities to procure new low carbon capacity (GW). The LCCS would provide a greater balance of energy and capacity supply than a renewable portfolio standard, which requires only the supply of energy (and excludes non-renewable low carbon generators). Approximately 25 GW of PJM generation capacity is scheduled to retire by 2019 and the RPSs currently in place in PJM will supply only 5 GW of Equivalent Load Carrying Capability (ELLC). An LCCS, providing {{the same amount of}} low carbon energy, would supply 13 to 16 GW of ELCC. We estimate the required reduction of capacity prices required to cover the investment cost premium low carbon capacity would require from consumers. For example, if the energy from an LCCS costs on average $ 20 /MWh more than energy from an RPS, the annual premium would be approximately $ 2. 2 B. In order for consumers to be better off with an LCCS in this example, capacity prices would have to decrease by $ 40 /MW-day. We find that if an LCCS were adopted, coal fired power plants with carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) would likely have the lowest cost per MW of capacity of all low carbon technologies, based on net Cost of New <b>Entry</b> (<b>CONE)</b> estimates...|$|E
40|$|Calcium is a {{messenger}} ion that controls {{all aspects of}} cone photoreceptor function, including synaptic release. The dynamic range of the cone output extends beyond the activation threshold for voltage-operated calcium entry, suggesting another calcium influx mechanism operates in cones hyperpolarized by light. We have used optical imaging and whole-cell voltage clamp to measure the contribution of store-operated Ca 2 + entry (SOCE) to Ca 2 + homeostasis {{and its role in}} regulation of neurotransmission at cone synapses. Mn 2 + quenching of Fura- 2 revealed sustained divalent cation <b>entry</b> in hyperpolarized <b>cones.</b> Ca 2 + influx into cone inner segments was potentiated by hyperpolarization, facilitated by depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores, unaffected by pharmacological manipulation of voltage-operated or cyclic nucleotide-gated Ca 2 + channels and suppressed by lanthanides, 2 -APB, MRS 1845 and SKF 96365. However, cation influx through store-operated channels crossed the threshold for activation of voltage-operated Ca 2 + entry in a subset of cones, indicating that the operating range of inner segment signals is set by interactions between store- and voltage-operated Ca 2 + channels. Exposure to MRS 1845 resulted in ∼ 40 % reduction of light-evoked postsynaptic currents in photopic horizontal cells without affecting the light responses or voltage-operated Ca 2 + currents in simultaneously recorded cones. The spatial pattern of store-operated calcium <b>entry</b> in <b>cones</b> matched immunolocalization of the store-operated sensor STIM 1. These findings show that store-operated channels regulate spatial and temporal properties of Ca 2 + homeostasis in vertebrate cones and demonstrate their role in generation of sustained excitatory signals across the first retinal synapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the impact between a rigid body and a gas-liquid mixture is {{relevant}} to various engineering applications, including the design of breakwaters and LNG containers. In the present study, the specific {{problem of the}} impact of a rigid cone upon the surface of an aerated liquid is investigated. Numerical simulations of water <b>entry</b> of <b>cones</b> with different dead-rise angles (7 ° and 15 °) were performed using an explicit finite element method. The air-water mixture is modelled as a homogeneous fluid with a specific equation of state. In addition, experimental tests {{of the impact of}} a cone with a dead-rise angle of 7 ° on the surface of bubbly water were performed. The air volume fraction was measured prior to the impact tests using optical probes technique, and the instantaneous impact force on the cone was measured using strain gauges. The results highlight a significant reduction of the impact load with the increase of the air volume fraction. Moreover, the numerical results show that this reduction is also dependent on the impact velocity. This phenomenon is found {{to be related to the}} nonlinearity of the equation of state of the air-water mixture...|$|R
40|$|Application of a viscous shock-layer {{analysis}} to {{the calculation of}} nonequilibrium-flow species distributions in the plasma layer of a blunt-nosed vehicle at high altitudes. The theoretical electron-density results obtained are in good agreement with those measured in flight for a hemisphere- 9 deg <b>cone</b> <b>entry</b> vehicle. The flight measurements were obtained using electrostatic probes that protruded well into the shock layer. In addition, the theoretically obtained heavy-particle translational temperatures appear to agree fairly well with the electron temperatures that were measured in the flight experiments using voltage-swept thin-wire electrostatic probes. The influence of the reaction rate coefficients on the calculated electron densities has been assessed and shown to be within the uncertainty in the flight data.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe problem treated in this dissertation is {{the behavior of a}} projectile as it passes from air into water. The behavior of the water during the establishment of the flow and the development of the cavity is a transient phenomenon. A description of the behavior of the fluid during the entry of a body requires a knowledge of pressures, sizes and shares as functions of time. An extensive experimental program has been conducted in order to determine these functions. The surface pressures, axial body accelerations and fluid surface motions have been studied during the vertical entry of light conical bodies of 45 -, 90 - and 140 -degree total angle. Also, the axial accelerations and surface motions have been studied during the oblique entry of a moderately heavy disk cylinder. All of these tests include the flow-establishment phase and the early cavity-development chase. The results of the experimental program in which the axial accelerations of light conical bodies were measured indicate that a single drag-coefficient function exists for each shape, and that the actual acceleration of the body may be calculated from this function by the application of the princioles of elementry mechanics. This standardized drag-coefficient function has been determined {{for each of the three}} cone angles. Motion of the water surface has been studied during entry. The maximum advance of spray or surface has been measured for the oblique entry of cylinders. A dimensionless surface shape has been determined for each cone tested; it is shown to remain geometrically similar during moderate accelerations to within the accuracy of the experiment. The results of the experimental program in which the pressure distribution on conical bodies was measured include: A dimensionless pressure profile for the constant-velocity <b>entry</b> of each <b>cone</b> angle studied; the variation in pressure profile resulting from model mass; and the pressure distribution on the body during early cavity development. Analysis of the data shows that the maximum pressure coefficient depends only upon cone angle, and not upon entry velocity or model mass. During entry, the major increase in pressure coefficient over the steady-state value is shown to exist near the free surface, while pressure changes due to deceleration are shown to occur at deeper locations. The axial accelerations measured during the oblique entry of disk cylinders show that the drag coefficient is independent of velocity. Interpretation of the experimental results shows that the penetration ratio is independent of entry angle. The values of added mass and penetration ratio for the vertical entry of a disk cylinder are determined as limit values of the oblique entry of disk cylinders and the vertical <b>entry</b> of <b>cones.</b> A single function is shown to reoresent the drag coefficient-versus-distance function for the oblique entry of disk cylinders...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of group}} III metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (mGluRs) in photoreceptor-H 1 horizontal cell (HC) synaptic transmission was investigated {{by analyzing the}} rate of occurrence and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in H 1 HCs uncoupled by dopamine in carp retinal slices. Red light steps or the application of 100 μM cobalt reduced the sEPSC rate without affecting their peak amplitude, {{which is consistent with}} hyperpolarization or the suppression of Ca 2 + <b>entry</b> into <b>cone</b> synaptic terminals reducing vesicular transmitter release. Conversely, postsynaptic blockade of H 1 HC AMPA receptors by 500 nM CNQX reduced the amplitude of sEPSCs without affecting their rate. This analysis of sEPSCs represents a novel methodology for distinguishing between presynaptic and postsynaptic sites of action. The selective agonist for group III mGluRs, l- 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate (L-APB or L-AP 4; 20 μM), reduced the sEPSC rate with a slight reduction in amplitude, which is consistent with a presynaptic action on cone synaptic terminals to reduce transmitter release. During L-APB application, recovery of sEPSC rate occurred with 500 μM (s) - 2 -methyl- 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate (MAP 4), a selective antagonist of group III mGluR, and with 200 μM 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP), a blocker of voltage-dependent potassium channels. Whole-cell recordings from cones in the retinal slice showed no effect of L-APB on voltage-activated Ca 2 + conductance. These results suggest that the activation of group III mGluRs suppresses transmitter release from cone presynaptic terminals via a 4 -AP–sensitive pathway. Negative feedback, operating via mGluR autoreceptors, may limit excessive glutamate release from cone synaptic terminals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{physical}} modeling and the digital time simulation of acoustic pipes. We will study the simplified case of a single convergent cone. It is modeled by a linear system made of delays and a transfer function which represents the wave reflection at the <b>entry</b> of the <b>cone.</b> According to [1], the input/output relation of this system is causal and stable whereas the reflection function is unstable. In the continuous time-domain, a first state space representation of this delay system is done. Then, we use a change of state to separate the unobservable subspace and its orthogonal complement, which is observable. Whereas the unobservable part is unstable, it is proved that the observable part is stable, using the D-Subdivision method. Thus, isolating this latter observable subspace, to build the minimal realization, defines a stable system. Finally, a discrete-time version of this system is derived and is proved to be stable using the Jury criterion. The main contribution of this work is neither the minimal realization of the system nor the proofs of stability, but it is rather the solving of an old problem of acoustics which has heen achieved using standard tools of automatic control. ...|$|R
40|$|Pulse-like {{currents}} resembling miniature postsynaptic currents {{were recorded}} in patch-clamped isolated cones from the tiger salamander retina. The events were absent in isolated cones without synaptic terminals. The frequency of events was increased by either raising the osmotic pressure or depolarizing the cell. It was decreased by the application of either glutamate or the glutamate-transport blockers dihydrokainate and D,L-threo- 3 -hydroxyaspartate. The events required external Na+ for which Li+ could not substitute. The reversal potential of these currents followed the equilibrium potential for Cl- when internal Cl- concentration was changed. Thus, these miniature currents appear to represent the presynaptic activation of the glutamate receptor with glutamate transporter-like pharmacology, caused by the photoreceptor's own vesicular glutamate release. Using a noninvasive method to preserve the intracellular Cl- concentration, we showed that glutamate elicits an outward current in isolated cones. Fluorescence of the membrane-permeable form of fura- 2 was used to monitor Ca 2 + <b>entry</b> at the <b>cone</b> terminal {{as a measure of}} membrane depolarization. The increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, elicited by puff application of 30 mM KCl, was completely suppressed in the presence of 100 microM glutamate. Puff application of glutamate alone had no measurable depolarizing effect. These results suggest that the equilibrium potential for Cl-, ECl, was more negative than the activation range for Ca 2 + channels and that glutamate elicited an outward current, hyperpolarizing the cones...|$|R
