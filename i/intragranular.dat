Grain boundary sliding along coincidence boundary was activated at higher stress {{and only in}} the presence of <b>intragranular</b> slip. Sliding along coincidence and near-coincidence boundaries is accompanied by regular boundary migration whereas sliding along general boundary is not. The sliding-migration behavior of coincidence boundaries was explained in terms of DSC-dislocations associated with steps. Sliding along general boundaries was described in terms of non-DSC grain boundary dislocations having infinitesimal Burgers vector. It is established in bicrystals with individual boundaries that crystallographic slip can increase significantly the rate of grain boundary sliding. Two mechanisms of stimulation of sliding by slip are proposed. <b>Intragranular</b> slip can make a direct contribution to grain boundary sliding in incompatible conditions of deformation. Identical deformation of grains can increase the rate of sliding only by its accommodation at boundary irregularities. The close relationship between sliding and slip at incompatible deformation makes <b>intragranular</b> slip strongly dependent on boundary structure and geometry of slip and independent of the Schmid factor.

During creep deformation of polycrystalline ice, strong stress and strain-rate <b>intragranular</b> heterogeneities are expected. These heterogeneities come from the very large viscoplastic anisotropy of ice crystals (with essentially a single easy plane for the dislocations to glide) which is responsible for the strong mechanical interaction between adjacent grains [1]. In order to go one step further in the quantitative understanding of this process, and to characterize the development of strain heterogeneities at a microscopic (<b>intragranular)</b> scale, we have performed deformation tests on 2 -D polycrystalline ice exhibiting columnar grains with controlled grain size.

For this purpose a policrystal Fe-based superconductor FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 sample has been studied. By the frequency dependence of the peaks of the temperature-dependent imaginary part of the fundamental complex susceptibility, the dependence on temperature of the characteristic times both for intergranular and <b>intragranular</b> relaxations of magnetic flux are derived, and the corresponding relaxation processes due to combinations of the flux creep, the flux flow and the thermally activated flux flow regimes are identified {{on the basis of the}} effective magnetic fields both at the sample surface and at the grains' surfaces.

Grain boundary sliding with and without development of <b>intragranular</b> slip is observed. The rate of sliding accompanied by slip is {{more than five times}} of that without slip.

For the case of formation of slip induced glissile grain boundary dislocations of opposite signs the possibility of their contribution to total grain boundary sliding, is analyzed. The effect of the increase in the rate of sliding is explained in terms of the accommodation of sliding by slip and appearance of additional glissile grain boundary dislocations of one sign due to strain incompatibility. Contribution of these different dislocation mechanisms to the increase in the sliding rate is determined for the stage of deformation preceding slide hardening.
