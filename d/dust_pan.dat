5000|$|Brushes {{used for}} {{cleaning}} come in various sizes. They vary in size ranging {{from that of}} a toothbrush, to the standard household version accompanied by a dustpan, to 36" [...] deck brushes. There are brushes for cleaning tiny cracks and crevices and brushes for cleaning enormous warehouse floors. Brushes perform a multitude of cleaning tasks. For example, brushes lightly dust the tiniest figurine, they help scrub stains out of clothing and shoes, they remove grime from tires, and they remove the dirt and debris found on floors {{with the help of a}} <b>dust</b> <b>pan.</b> Specific brushes are used for diverse activities from cleaning vegetables, as a toilet brush, washing glass, cleaning tiles, and as a mild abrasive for sanding.|$|E

5000|$|Hitler told {{a conference}} of the National Socialist Women's League (NS-Frauenschaft) in September 1938: [...] "The slogan 'Emancipation of women' was invented by Jewish intellectuals and its content was formed by the same spirit. In the really good times of German life the German woman {{had no need to}} emancipate herself ... If the man's world {{is said to be the}} State, his struggle, his {{readiness}} to devote his powers to the service of the community, then it may perhaps be said that the woman's is a smaller world. For her world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home." [...] The Nazi viewpoint was summed up by Hermann Göring in his [...] "Nine Commandments for the Workers’ Struggle", published in 1934, in which he exhorted women to [...] "take hold of the frying pan, <b>dust</b> <b>pan,</b> and broom, and marry a man." [...] Young girls were compelled to join the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Mädel) while older women became members of the NS-Frauenschaft. Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the head of the NS-Frauenschaft, told a Nazi party conference in 1935 that [...] "women must be the spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people, called upon by fate for this special task." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure safety}} {{regarding}} dust explosion hazards, {{it is important}} to study the dust lifting process experimentally and identify important parameters that will be valuable for development and validation of numerical predictions of this phenomenon. A new shock tube test section was developed and integrated into an existing shock tube facility. The test section allows for shadowgraph or laser scattering techniques to track dust layer particle motion. The test section is designed to handle an initial pressure of 1 atm with an incident shock wave velocity up to Mach 2 to mimic real world conditions. The test section features an easily removable <b>dust</b> <b>pan</b> and inserts to allow for adjustment of dust layer thickness. The design allows for the changing of experimental variables including initial pressure, Mach number, dust layer thickness and characteristics of the dust itself. A separate vacuum manifold was designed to protect existing equipment from negative side effects of the dust. A study was performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new facility and to compare results with experimental trends formerly established in the literature. Forty-micron limestone dust with a layer thickness of 3. 2 mm was subjected to Mach 1. 22 and 1. 38 shock waves, and a high-speed shadowgraph was used for flow visualization. Dust layer rise height was graphed with respect to shock wave propagation. Dust particles subjected to a Mach 1. 38 shock wave rose more rapidly and to a greater height with respect to shock wave propagation than particles subjected to a Mach 1. 22 shock wave. These results are in agreement with trends found in the literature, and a new area of investigation was identified...|$|E

40|$|Rectal swabs from 122 {{patients}} and 497 environmental swabs from several wards were examined {{for the presence}} of Clostridium difficile in order to assess the role of the environment in the spread of this organism. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 / 27 (22. 2 %) oncology {{patients and}} from 8 / 163 (4. 9 %) environmental specimens obtained from the oncology unit. Items found positive for C difficile were those subjected to faecal contamination such as commode chairs, bed <b>pans,</b> <b>dust</b> <b>pans,</b> discard bins, the sluice and a disposable bed pan machine. Fourteen of 51 (27. 4 %) asymptomatic neonates yielded mostly toxigenic C difficile in their stools during their first week of life. Five of 156 (3. 2 %) specimens taken from inanimate objects in the environment of the neonatal units were positive for C difficile. The organism was also isolated from the hands of a nurse. Similar antibiogram patterns were demonstrated in the strains obtained from the patients and their environment indicating the possible occurrence of cross infection. These results indicate that environmental contamination is important in the spread of C difficile in hospitalised patients and the implementation of isolation procedures may limit that spread...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the days}} {{immediately}} before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying [...] "Wash away the dirt on nin ya baat" [...] (...) , but {{the practice is}} not restricted to nin ya baat (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and <b>dust</b> <b>pans</b> are put away {{on the first day}} so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year. Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word [...] "hair" [...] (fa) and the word for [...] "prosperity". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie <b>dust</b> from <b>Pan,</b> hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} pulmonary {{function and}} respiratory symptoms in workers {{engaged in the}} early manufacturing processes of tea and to identify the associated factors, we conducted a study in a tea production area in Taiwan. Methods We recruited tea workers who engaged in the early manufacturing process in the Mountain Ali area in Taiwan and a comparison group of local office workers who were matched for age, gender, and smoking habits. We performed questionnaire interviews, pulmonary function tests, skin prick tests, and measurement of specific IgE for tea on the participants and assessed tea dust exposures in the tea factories. Results The 91 participating tea workers had higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms than the comparison group (32 participants). Among tea workers, ball-rolling workers had the highest prevalence of symptoms and the highest exposures of inhalable dusts. At baseline, tea workers had similar pulmonary functions as the comparison group, but {{compared to the other}} tea workers ball-rolling workers had a lower ratio of the 1 -second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) and a lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rate expressed as% of the predicted value [...] MMF (%pred). A total of 58 tea workers participated in the on-site investigation and the cross-shift lung function measurements. We found ball-rolling yielded the highest inhalable <b>dust</b> level, <b>panning</b> yielded the highest respirable dust level, and withering yielded the lowest levels of both dusts. Ball-rolling also yielded the highest coarse fraction (defined as inhalable dusts minus respirable dusts), which represented exposures from nose to tracheobronchial tract. During the shift, we observed significant declines in pulmonary function, especially in ball-rolling workers. Multiple regressions showed that age, height, work tasks, coarse fraction, and number of months working in tea manufacturing each year were independent predictors of certain pulmonary function parameters in tea workers. Conclusions Tea workers engaged in early manufacturing processes of tea have higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function impairment, which might be related to tea dust exposures, especially the coarse fraction. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{sampling}} protocol for the retention, extraction, {{and analysis of}} sulfoxyanions in hydrothermal waters has been developed in the laboratory and tested at Yellowstone National Park and Green Lake, NY. Initial laboratory testing of the anion-exchange resin Bio-Rad™ AG 1 -X 8 indicated that the resin was well suited for the sampling, preservation, and extraction of sulfate and thiosulfate. Synthetic solutions containing sulfate and thiosulfate were passed through AG 1 -X 8 resin columns and eluted with 1 and 3 M KCl, respectively. Recovery ranged from 89 to 100 %. Comparison of results for water samples collected from five pools in Yellowstone National Park between on-site 1 C analysis (U. S. Geological Survey mobile lab) and IC analysis of resin-stored sample at SUNY-Stony Brook indicates 96 to 100 % agreement for three pools (Cinder, Cistern, and an unnamed pool near Cistern) and 76 and 63 % agreement for two pools (Sulfur <b>Dust</b> and Frying <b>Pan).</b> Attempts to extract polythionates from the AG 1 -X 8 resin were made using HCl solutions, but were unsuccessful. Bio-Rad™ AG 2 -X 8, an anion-exchange resin with weaker binding sites than the AG 1 -X 8 resin, is better suited for polythionate extraction. Sulfate and thiosulfate extraction with this resin has been accomplished with KCl solutions of 0. 1 and 0. 5 M, respectively. Trithionate and tetrathionate can be extracted with 4 M KCl. Higher polythionates can be extracted with 9 M hydrochloric acid. Polythionate concentrations can then be determined directly using ion chromatographic methods, and laboratory results indicate recovery of up to 90 % for synthetic polythionate solutions using AG 2 -X 8 resin columns...|$|R
