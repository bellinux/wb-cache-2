25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{hiatus of}} several years, Ford {{introduced}} a new Thunderbird for 2002. Returning to the original formula for the Thunderbird, the latest version had a two-seat coupe/convertible layout like the first-generation Thunderbird and retrofuturistic styling to match. The eleventh generation Thunderbird was built at Ford's Wixom Assembly Plant and {{was based on the}} company's DEW98 platform, which was shared with the Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type. Though the Thunderbird's exterior styling was unique relative to its platform mates, the instrument panel, steering wheel and other trim pieces were borrowed from Lincoln LS. The sole engine of the Thunderbird was a Jaguar-designed AJ-30 3.9L DOHC V8, a short-stroke (85mm) variant of the Jaguar AJ-26 4.0L V8, making [...] and [...] of torque. The engine was mated to Ford's 5R55N 5-speed automatic transmission. The AJ-30 V8 was replaced by the AJ-35 in 2003 and later Thunderbirds, bringing with it variable valve timing (VVT) and <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (ETC) as well as [...] and [...] of torque. Complementing the extra power and torque provided by the AJ-35 V8, a manual shift feature for the 5-speed automatic called SelectShift was available as an option in 2003 and later Thunderbirds. With sales dropping off significantly after its first model year, Ford decided to make the 2005 model year the Thunderbird's last with no scheduled successor. The last one rolled off the assembly line on July 1, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: “Throttle-by-Wire ” is an <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> {{system in}} which {{mechanical}} cables and hydraulics are replaced by a fieldbus network, electric motors and sensors. It is crucial for an <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> to design a controller that can offer an accurate and fast reference tracking performance {{in the presence of}} nonlinearities, such as friction in the gearbox and “limp-home ” nonlinearity. This paper presents a nonlinear dynamic inversion based <b>control</b> algorithm for <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> systems.

It is proposed for tracking control of an uncertain nonlinear system. In the proposed control scheme, the adaptation law is able to update the PID controller online during the control process within a short period. The chattering phenomenon of the SMC can be alleviated by incorporation of a first-order LPF, while the robustness of the control system {{is similar to that}} of the sliding mode. In the closed-loop control analysis, the convergence condition in the reaching phase and the existence condition of the sliding mode were analyzed. The stability of the closed-loop control is guaranteed in the sense of Lyapunov’s direct method.

40|$|The torque {{response}} of the engine {{is important for the}} driving experience of a vehicle. In spark ignited engines, torque is proportional to the air flow into the cylinders. Controlling torque therefore implies controlling air flow. In modern turbocharged engines, the driver commands are interpreted by an electronic control unit that controls the engine through electromechanical and pneumatic actuators. Air flow to the intake manifold is <b>controlled</b> by an <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle,</b> and a wastegate controls the energy to the turbine, affecting boost pressure and air flow. These actuators and their dynamics affect the torque response and a lot of time is put into calibration of controllers for these actuators. By modeling and understanding the actuator behavior this dynamics can be compensated for, leaving a reduced control problem, which can shorten the calibration time. <b>Electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> servo <b>control</b> is the first problem studied. By constructing a control oriented model for the throttle servo and inverting that model, the resulting controller becomes two static compensators for friction and limp-home nonlinearities, together with a PD-controller. A gain-scheduled I-part is added for robustness to handle model errors. The sensitivity to model errors is studied and a method for tuning the controller is presented. The performance has been evaluated in simulation, in test vehicle, and in a <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> benchmark. A model for a pneumatic wastegate actuator and solenoid control valve, used for boost pressure control, is presented. The actuator dynamics is shown to be important for the transient boost pressure response. The model is incorporated in a mean value engine model and shown to give accurate description of the transient response. A tuning method for the  feedback (PID) part of a boost controller is proposed, based on step responses in wastegate control signal. Together with static feedforward the controller is shown to achieve the desired boost pressure response. Submodels for an advanced boost control system consisting of several vacuum actuators, solenoid valves, a vacuum tank and a vacuum pump are developed. The submodels and integrated system are evaluated on a two stage series sequential turbo system, and control with system voltage disturbance rejection is demonstrated on an engine in a test cell. Turbocharged V-type engines often have two parallel turbochargers, each powered by one bank of cylinders. When the two air paths are connected before the throttle an unwanted oscillation can occur. When the compressors operate close to the surge line and a disturbance alters the mass flow balance, the compressors can begin to alternately go into surge, this is called co-surge. Measurements on co-surge in parallel turbocharged engines are presented and analyzed. A mean value engine model, augmented with a Moore-Greitzer compressor model to handle surge, is shown to capture the cosurge behavior. A sensitivity analysis shows which model parameters have the largest influence of the phenomena. The compressor operation in the map during co-surge is studied, and the alternating compressor speeds are shown to {{have a major impact on}} the continuing oscillation. Based on the analysis, detection methods and a controller are proposed, these detect co-surge and control the turbo speeds to match during co-surge. The controller is evaluated both in simulation and on a test vehicle in a vehicle dynamometer, showing that co-surge can be detected and the oscillations quelled...|$|R

5000|$|On November 25, 2009, ABC News quoted Sean Kane, head of {{the for-profit}} firm Safety Research & Strategies, stating that he had {{uncovered}} hundreds of [...] "non-floor mat sudden acceleration cases" [...] which the floor mat recall did not address. Kane, who works with attorneys suing Toyota, said his firm had discovered over 2,000 Toyota sudden acceleration cases involving 16 deaths and 243 injuries, publishing its most comprehensive report on the issue on Feb 5th, 2010. Kane alleged that the problem was not with the accelerator pedals, but with the <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> systems (ETC). [...] An <b>electronic</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>control</b> system is a drive-by-wire system, in which the accelerator pedal and the engine are indirectly linked electronically, instead of directly linked mechanically.
