5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe,</b> the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It irks me,' {{he said at}} last. 'The {{speed and}} the clatter irk me. Moreover, my chela, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> we have over-passed that River.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>maybe</b> put a {{spoke in}} the wheel. The raising the statute labour of Roxburgh to an oppressive extent, to make roads in England, is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> jimp legal, and will be much complained of by the poorer heritors. Henry of Harden dines with me tête-à-tête, {{excepting}} the girls.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Townend (Irish Invader, eleventh): [...] "It was great. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he just <b>maybe</b> didn't see it (the trip) out." ...|$|R
500|$|The writers {{started to}} work for [...] "Band Geeks" [...] {{with the idea of}} a rival. Williams said, [...] "We always wanted to do a rival show, and I think we tried to do a rival show for SpongeBob, and it wasn't working. So we came up {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band. I was not in a band, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> Doug [...] was in a band. I think Steve [...] was in a band, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1975, after First Lady Betty Ford made {{comments}} on sex, Lady Bird expressed sympathy: [...] "I know {{the pressures of}} being a First Lady, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> she got asked one question too quick." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{fact that}} we can come and put on, not just a concert, but the same concert that we've put on in Paris, New York, and London, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is <b>maybe</b> a symbol {{for the people of}} Sarajevo that things are getting back to normal." [...] —The Edge ...|$|R
5000|$|I just {{happened}} to find this beautiful boat that was built as a houseboat and was very cheap, so I bought it. And then only afterward did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could <b>maybe</b> use it to record. The control room is a 30-foot by 20-foot room. It's a very comfortable working environment--- three bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, a big lounge. It's 90 feet long.:—David Gilmour ...|$|R
5000|$|Crawley Town boss Steve Evans {{said after}} the loan, [...] "The reality is despite how much I wanted him, the clubs could not agree on a {{transfer}} fee. <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> his wages {{could have been a}} problem because it should not be forgotten they were heavily subsidised by Ipswich when he was on loan with us." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> that wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 4, 2004, Kean again {{stated that}} the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying that the United States {{government}} should have acted sooner to dismantle al-Qaeda and responded more quickly to other terrorist threats. [...] "When we actually saw bin Laden on the ground, using the Predator or other means, did we have...actionable intelligence? Should we have sent a cruise missile into a site where he was at that point? I think those early opportunities are clear. We had him. We saw him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> {{we could have done}} something about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{recording}} {{took place}} at Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville in February 2014, including all of Auerbach's vocals. According to the band, they wrote 30 songs while recording the album, but were unable to complete all of them. Carney spent about three-to-four days sequencing the album at his studio before soliciting Auerbach's input. The only change made to the running order was the addition of [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] to the end; Carney had wanted [...] "In Our Prime" [...] to close the record, but Auerbach thought the song was too sad and preferred a catchy, upbeat track to conclude the album. Carney agreed with the change, saying, [...] "Actually, I think it works well at the end, too. It erases your brain from whatever heavy elements {{there are in the}} record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it encourages you to go back and listen to the record again." ...|$|E
2500|$|People <b>think</b> <b>I</b> asked Ellar, [...] "What {{did you do}} {{in school}} the other day? Let's make a scene about that!" [...] That never happened. The time we spent {{together}} was me just gauging where he was at in his life—what his concerns were {{and what he was}} doing. Then <b>I</b> would <b>think,</b> <b>maybe</b> we could move the camping trip up, and we can do this or that.|$|R
5000|$|The dynamic {{began to}} change when Paul went from guitar to bass and during the Everything era. Siourthas said in 2007, [...] "Even though there is now only one guitar, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there's <b>maybe</b> more room now, Peter will pull back and play a solid beat and Jim will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that." ...|$|R
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Rachel and {{eliminate}} Sarah, saying [...] "I {{have to think}} as a producer and <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> Rachel was rock solid, and there were moments that <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> you were a bit fragile", adding [...] "but you were wonderful and you did exactly what I asked." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "He {{has that}} wall up, and it's not {{necessarily}} his fault; it's his past that has built the wall. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> Babe had unrealistic expectations hoping, 'Oh, with time he'll let me in.' Well, it's their second marriage {{and they have}} a child together and it still has not changed. That wall is not budging." [...] Havins continued, [...] "Babe can only take so much. Plus, her husband tried to kill her. I honestly think, in a way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It happened so fast, and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. I would walk away for a lot less! I think she was so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh. Everything she wants to feel with her husband she's feeling with Josh, and that's what's missing, because JR doesn't talk.|$|E

6000|$|... "You can't really {{blame him}} for being mad. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I'd be mad myself," [...] said Gif. [...] "However, let's drop that. What {{are we going to}} do? Go to bed?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it opened}} up {{my view of}} film—that there's so much more that could be done. Actually, by {{breaking}} so many rules, he allowed other people to say, [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> can <b>maybe</b> <b>think</b> of some stuff, too!" [...] He just opened up the possibilities more for me. That's what he did.|$|R
5000|$|Graber {{was raised}} in Wildwood, New Jersey where she still owns a home. She studied under poet Stephen Dunn {{and went on to}} earn her BA in {{philosophy}} from New York University. She quit teaching middle school English to afford herself the ability to enroll in an MFA program and pursue a career in poetry. Kathleen said of the experience, [...] "Most poets live humble lives, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>maybe</b> that is by temperament or design, or maybe it is just a necessity." ...|$|R
2500|$|Duke coach Bill Foster wasn't {{amused by}} Smith's tactics {{in the first}} half and the next day said, [...] "I've been doing this a long time, but during the first half last night <b>I</b> began to <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I've been doing it for too long." [...] He then added this infamous dig: [...] "I thought Naismith invented basketball, not Deansmith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know exactly, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I {{can find}} out," [...] {{answered}} the sneak. He felt much subdued, especially {{as he saw}} {{the eyes of many}} of the other cadets on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Dad {{and your}} father are walking around. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> they're looking for me. Maybe the cook told them I took the meat. Anyway, we don't want them coming here after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave!" [...] cried Jessie, {{as soon as}} {{she could}} motion our hero to one side, [...] "I've got {{something}} I want to tell you! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it will be of assistance in proving your identity," [...] and the girl's eyes glowed with anticipation.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> someone, <b>maybe</b> Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, Woomble moved to the Isle of Mull with his wife, Ailidh Lennon. Woomble notes: [...] "We moved to Mull for the space, for the environment, but it's {{actually}} been {{the people that have}} been so important. My wife has family there. At first I knew no one at all, but the songs I've written have definitely been shaped by the people I've met. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's odd how these songs came together quite quickly, then <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> well <b>maybe</b> it's not been quick at all, maybe it's taken me 34 years to get here and I just didn't realise it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{is likely}} to {{continue}} to {{have a major impact on}} the dance world during the 1990s and no doubt will leave her mark in dance history, along with other black women modern dance choreographers, including Pearl Primus and Katherine Dunham. [...] "I'm really trying to find new markers with each piece, to observe what worked in one that might improve the next," [...] Miller told Sandla. [...] "I would not say that building a career as an independent choreographer has been easy, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it's been as hard for me as it's been for some. Looking back ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe,</b> just maybe, I've gotten somewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said, [...] "I'll {{have to get}} you {{to excuse}} me; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I might write to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some {{practice}} and learned the language I am confident I could. But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption.|$|E
6000|$|And he {{held out}} the money to her; but Maggie drew back her hand. [...] "Na, na, Captain; ye're ower young and ower free o' your siller--ye should never tak a fish-wife's first bode; and troth <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> a flyte wi' the auld {{housekeeper}} at Monkbarns, or Miss Grizel, would do me some gude--And I {{want to see what}} that hellicate quean Jenny Ritherout's doing--folk said she wasna weel--She'll be vexing hersell about Steenie, the silly tawpie, as if he wad ever hae lookit ower his shouther at the like o'her!--Weel, Monkbarns, they're braw caller haddies, and they'll bid me unco little indeed at the house if ye want crappit-heads the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes I just can't believe she's my daughter," [...] Hannah said dejectedly to Janet {{when they}} were alone {{together}} in the kitchen after Lise had gone out. [...] "I'm fond of her because she's my own flesh and blood--I'm ashamed of it, but I can't help it. I guess it's what the minister in Dolton used to call a visitation. I suppose I deserve it, but sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> if your father had been different {{he might have been}} able to put a stop to the way she's going on. She ain't like any of the Wenches, nor any of the Bumpuses, so far's I'm able to find out. She just don't seem to have any notion about right and wrong. Well, the world has got all jumbled up--it beats me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that's a new idea, at all, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> do it to an extreme." [...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, all I want to {{know from}} you, my friend, is, whether you are seeking to do this Mr. Alan Fairford good or harm; because {{if you come to}} do him good, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you could <b>maybe</b> get speech of him--and if to do him harm, I will take the liberty to give you a cast across the Firth, with fair warning not to come back on such an errand, lest worse come of it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon the album's release, Kenny Anderson {{noted that}} there are {{references}} {{to his mother and}} father throughout From Scotland with Love, stating: [...] "My dad's in this album a lot. There are a lot of songs on it that have little jokes in them for me, or for my dad. ... song, [...] "Leaf Piece", that comes from my mum, that's what she always called it - 'Don't forget your leaf piece!' It's a bag of crisps, or an apple, or a cheese piece. It was a big thing, it was the first break in the day when you were potatoes. You couldn't wait to get your leaf piece. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's <b>maybe</b> meant to be 'leave piece' originally - I wonder if it got Anderson-ised." ...|$|R
