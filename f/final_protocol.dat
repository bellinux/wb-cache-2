Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their <b>final</b> <b>protocol</b> to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing distributed mecha-nisms for joint congestion control and resource allocation in spatial-reuse TDMA wireless networks. The design problem is posed as a utility maximization subject to link rate con-straints that involve both power allocation and transmission scheduling over multiple time-slots. Starting from the per-formance limits of a centralized optimization based on global network information, we proceed systematically in the de-velopment of distributed and transparent protocols. In the process, we introduce a novel decomposition method for con-vex optimization, establish its convergence for the utility maximization problem and demonstrate how it suggests a distributed solution based on flow control optimization and incremental updates of the transmission schedule. We de-velop a two-step procedure for finding the schedule updates and suggest two schemes for distributed channel reservation and power control under realistic interference models. Al-though the <b>final</b> <b>protocols</b> are suboptimal, we isolate and quantify the performance losses incurred by each simplifica-tion and demonstrate strong performance in examples...|$|R

The types of systems covered include small turbines, reciprocating engines (including Stirling Cycle), and microturbines.

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>final</b> irrigation <b>protocols</b> on microhardness reduction and erosion of root canal dentin. Sixty root canals from mandibular incisors were instrumented and randomly divided into six groups (n = 10) according to the irrigant used: QMiX, 17 % EDTA, 10 % citric acid (CA), 1 % peracetic acid (PA), 2. 5 % NaOCl (solution control), and distilled water (negative control). The chelating solutions were used to irrigate the canal followed by 2. 5 % NaOCl as a final flush. After the irrigation protocols, all specimens were rinsed with 10 mL of distilled water to remove any residue of the chemical solutions. Before and after the <b>final</b> irrigation <b>protocols,</b> dentin microhardness was measured with a Knoop indenter. Three indentations were made at 100 µm and 500 µm from the root canal lumen. Afterwards, the specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic analysis {{and the amount of}} dentin erosion was examined. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the results with a significance level set at 5 %. At 100 µm, all protocols significantly reduced dentin microhardness (p <. 05), while at 500 µm, this effect was detected only in the EDTA and QMiX groups (p <. 05). CA was the irrigant that caused more extensive erosion in dentinal tubules, followed by PA and EDTA. QMiX opened dentinal tubules, but did not cause dentin erosion. Results suggest that QMiX and 17 % EDTA reduced dentin microhardness at a greater depth. Additionally, QMiX did not cause dentin erosion...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} in vitro {{the capacity of}} debris removal from the apical third of flattened root canals, using different <b>final</b> irrigation <b>protocols.</b> Thirty human mandibular central incisors with a mesiodistal flattened root were prepared using rotary instrumentation by Endo-Flare 25. 12 and Hero 642 30. 06, 35. 02, 40. 02 files, irrigated with 2 mL of 1 % NaOCl after each file. The specimens were randomly distributed into 5 groups according to the final irrigation of root canals: Group I: 10 mL of distilled water (control), Group II: 10 mL of 1 % NaOCl for 8 min, Group III: 2 mL of 1 % NaOCl for 2 min (repeated 4 times), Group IV: 10 mL of 2. 5 % NaOCl for 8 min, and Group V: 10 mL of 2. 5 % NaOCl for 2 min (repeated 4 times). The apical thirds of the specimens were subjected to histological processing and 6 -&# 956;m cross-sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The specimens were examined under optical microscopy at × 40 magnification and the images were subjected to morphometric analysis using the Scion image-analysis software. The total area of root canal and the area with debris were measured in square millimeters. Analysis of variance showed {{no statistically significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) among the groups GI (2. 39 ± 3. 59), GII (2. 91 ± 2. 21), GIII (0. 73 ± 1. 36), GIV (0. 95 ± 0. 84) and GV (0. 51 ± 0. 22).
