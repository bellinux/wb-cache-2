25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that most corvids are not {{threatened}} (many even increasing due to human activity) a few species are in danger. For example, the destruction of the Southeast Asian rainforests is endangering mixed-species feeding flocks with members from the family Corvidae. Also, since its semiarid scrubland habitat is an endangered ecosystem, the <b>Florida</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>jay</b> has a small and declining population. A number of island species, which are more vulnerable to introduced species and habitat loss, have been driven to extinction, such as the New Zealand raven, or are threatened, like the Mariana crow.|$|E

40|$|The <b>scrub</b> (or California) <b>jay</b> (Aphelocoma coerulescens) is {{distinguished}} by its crestless head, olive-gray back, and white throat, outlined in blue. <b>Scrub</b> <b>jays</b> {{are found in}} the western United States, parts of Mexico, and in central <b>Florida.</b> <b>Scrub</b> <b>jays</b> commonly inhabit the oak and brush-covered foothills of the mountains, timbered canyons, river bottoms, oak-lined sloughs and creeks, as well as the shade trees and dense shrubbery of residential areas. Beal (1910) reported that the diet of the <b>scrub</b> <b>jay</b> consisted of 73 % plant and 27 % animal matter. The plant matter was about one-third fruits and berries, and two-thirds acorns, nuts, and grain. Nests are usually found on brush-covered hillsides or in creek bottoms in low bushes, shrubs, and trees. Jays are omnivorous and therefore may damage several agricultural crops such as nuts, fruits, grains, peas, corn, and berries. <b>Scrub</b> <b>jays</b> are classified as migratory nongame birds in the Code of Federal Regulations...|$|R

5000|$|Increased {{prolactin}} in {{the breeding}} pair {{leads to the}} expression of parental behavior and physiology. The source of the alloparental behavior found in helper birds {{has been the focus}} of many studies. A positive correlation was found between increased prolactin levels during the breeding period and helping behavior in non-breeding Aphelocoma jays. This suggests that helper birds do not simply respond to the calls of the young, but begin to shown parental behavior even before the chicks hatch. These data suggest that natural selection may be acting on cooperative breeding in Aphelocoma jays and New World jays in general because the birds are reacting to more than just an environmental stimulus. Studies have also been done on <b>Florida</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>jays</b> (Aphelocoma coerulescens) and results have confirmed the hypothesis that increased prolactin levels are correlated with an increase in parental behavior in helper birds.

40|$|The {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} suggests that animals will {{do their best to}} maximize their number of offspring. So why do some young <b>Florida</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>jays</b> stay at the nest and help their parents to raise next year’s brood, instead of striking out on their own? Why do most ants, bees and termites remain childless, working tirelessly for the good of their colony? Ever since the landmark work of Hamilton (1964), we have understood such social phenomena in terms of kin selection. This is the idea that an organism has two ways of perpetuating its genetic material: firstly, by direct reproduction, and secondly, by assisting relatives in their reproductive efforts, thereby promoting the survival of copies of at least some of its genes. Hamilton quantified kin selection by noting that assisting a relative would be selected for if rB − C> 0, that is, if the benefit of being helped out (B), scaled by {{the degree to which the}} two parties were related (r), was greater than the cost of being nice (C). Steven A. Frank, in his recent book Foundations of Social Evolution (1998), is not out to capsize this orthodox Hamiltonian view. However, he argues that the appealing simplicity of Hamilton’s formulation can be misleading, and that it does not alway...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, these owls may prey on {{threatened}} species. Following {{the devastation}} to its populations from DDT, the reintroduction of the peregrine falcon to the Mississippi and Hudson Rivers was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night. Similarly, as mainly recorded in New England, attempts to reintroduce ospreys, {{after they were}} also hit hard by DDT, were effected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of roseate terns. Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation. While at least the ospreys and peregrines have rebounded admirably nonetheless, bird and mammal species that are much rarer overall sometimes fall prey to great horned owls, many in which even sporadic losses can be devastating. Among the species considered threatened, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN which are also known to be killed by great horned owls are Townsend's ground squirrels (Urocitellus townsendii), Pacific pocket mice (Perognathus pacificus), giant kangaroo rats, Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), black-footed ferrets, greater and lesser prairie chickens, marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), ivory-billed woodpeckers, <b>Florida</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>jays</b> (Aphelocoma coerulescens), pinyon jays, Kirtland's warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) and rusty blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus). The American Bird Conservancy's “green list” includes birds with considerable population declines (many classed as near threatened by the IUCN) or other immediate threats and/or restricted populations. Altogether, great horned owls hunt 50 different species from that list.|$|R
