5000|$|In 1927, Harold Edgerton {{built his}} first flash unit {{while at the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Wanting to {{photograph}} the motion of a motor in vivid detail, without blur, Edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mercury-arc rectifier, instead of an open-air discharge, to produce the light. He was able to achieve a <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> of 10 microseconds, {{and was able to}} photograph the moving motor as if [...] "frozen in time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, {{a common}} Technology Day {{demonstration}} used the unobstructed {{length of the}} corridor to demonstrate {{the speed of light}} in a simple, direct way. A strobe light, photocell, and oscilloscope were positioned {{at one end of the}} corridor, and a mirror at the other. The round-trip time was about two microseconds. The photocell picked up both the direct and reflected flashes. The <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> being well under a microsecond, the result was two nicely separated pulses on the oscilloscope screen, which could be measured to compute the speed.|$|E
50|$|This {{is because}} {{even at the}} most {{powerful}} settings, <b>flash</b> <b>durations</b> seldom exceed a few milliseconds (thousandths of a second). With focal-plane shutters, a flash begins shortly after the shutter curtain has fully opened and must extinguish before the curtain begins to close. Selecting any shutter speed faster than the camera’s rated Xsync speed, which is often between 1/60&thinsp;th and 1/200&thinsp;th of a second (from as long as 16.7 milliseconds to as little as 5.0 milliseconds) causes the shutter curtain to begin wiping closed across the film or sensor before the flash has extinguished. When this happens, an underexposed, gradated band appears along an edge of the image—often trailing off darker towards the left or bottom.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Shape {{patterns}} were displayed with simultaneous brief flashes from a light-emitting diode array. <b>Flash</b> <b>durations</b> in the microsecond range and luminous intensities were adjusted to vary {{the degree of}} successful shape recognition. Four experiments were conducted to test whether Bloch’s law would apply in this task. Bloch’s law holds that for very brief flashes the perceptual threshold {{is determined by the}} total number of photons being delivered, i. e., there is reciprocity of intensity and duration. The present results did not find that effectiveness of flashes was based on the total quantity of photons, as predicted by Bloch’s law. Additionally, the evidence points to a visual mechanism that has ultra-high temporal precision that either registers the rate of photon flux or the <b>duration</b> of <b>flashes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{limits to}} long pulse {{durations}} are {{the number of}} transferred electrons to the anode, sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode, and the temperature gradients of the glass. Pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode, while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise. For continuous operation the cooling is the limit. Discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 0.1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds, and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz. <b>Flash</b> <b>duration</b> can be carefully controlled {{with the use of}} an inductor.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, {{changes in}} the input voltage or {{capacitance}} {{have no effect on}} discharge time, although they do have an effect on current density. As <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> decreases, the electrical energy becomes concentrated into shorter pulses, so the current density will increase. Compensating for this usually requires lowering the capacitance as pulse duration decreases, and then raising the voltage proportionately in order to maintain a high enough energy-level. However, as pulse duration decreases, so does the [...] "explosion energy" [...] rating of the lamp, so the energy level must also be decreased to avoid destroying the lamp.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{electronic}} {{flash unit}} has electronic circuitry to charge a high-capacity capacitor to several hundred volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a flash tube, producing a flash of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the <b>flash</b> <b>duration,</b> often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of full flash brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach full brightness; electronic flash does not have these difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, an insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) can be connected {{in series with}} both the trigger transformer and the lamp, making adjustable <b>flash</b> <b>durations</b> possible. An IGBT {{used for this purpose}} must be rated for a high pulsed-current, so as to avoid over-current damage to the semiconductor junction. This type of system is used frequently in high average-power laser systems, and can produce pulses ranging from 500 microseconds to over 20 milliseconds. It can be used with any of the triggering techniques, like external and series, and can produce square wave pulses. It can even be used with simmer voltage to produce a [...] "modulated" [...] continuous wave output, with repetition rates over 300 hertz. With the proper large bore, water-cooled flashtube, several kilowatts of average-power output can be obtained.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{more than}} a century {{researchers}} have been reporting that the visual impact of a very brief flash is determined by the quantity of photons that the flash delivers. This has been variously described as the Bunsen-Roscoe Law or Bloch’s Law, often specified as reciprocity of intensity 3 duration. Prior research found no evidence for such reciprocity when microsecond-duration flashes from a light-emitting diode array were used to display the major contours of nameable shapes. The present work tested with <b>flash</b> <b>durations</b> ranging up to 100 ms and also found no reciprocity. This departure from classic principles might be due to the specific range of wavelengths of the light-emitting diodes and to a mesopic level of ambient light, which together would preclude activation of rods. The reciprocity of intensity and duration may only be valid with full dark adaptation and very dim flashes that activate rods...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft {{observations}} of Venusian lightning are reviewed {{to determine the}} energy dissipation rate. Optical sensors provide data on the total energy dissipated per flash, {{so long as the}} contributions of atomic oxygen and ionized carbon are accounted for. Radio probes yield information on the total lightning occurrences. Venera 9 - 12 radio surveys are reviewed, and event rates of 20 - 30 /sec for Venera 11 are mentioned. Venera 9 observed a sole, 70 sec event period on the Venusian nightside. Comparisons are made between the recorded electromagnetic energy levels and terrestrial lightning data. The nightside occurrence rate is calculated to be 0. 08 strokes/sq km per year, while the dayside exhibits 85 flashes/sq km per sec. Energy dissipation rates ranging from 0. 0012 - 0. 25 W/sq m are calculated for various <b>flash</b> <b>durations.</b> It is suggested that the lightning occurs in the clouds as part of an organized meteorological system...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} requirements for a flashtube can vary, {{depending on the}} desired results. The usual method is to first determine the pulse duration, {{the maximum amount of}} energy tolerable at that duration (explosion energy), and the safe amount of operating energy. Then pick a current density that will emit the desired spectrum, and let the lamp's resistance determine the necessary combination of voltage and capacitance to produce it. The resistance in flashtubes varies greatly, depending on pressure, shape, dead volume, current density, time, and <b>flash</b> <b>duration,</b> and therefore, is usually referred to as impedance. The most common symbol used for lamp impedance is Ko, which is expressed as ohms(amps0.5).|$|E
50|$|Series {{triggering}} is {{more common}} in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor). The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the <b>flash</b> <b>duration,</b> but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for external triggering. However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.|$|E
5000|$|Catastrophic failure {{can occur}} from two {{separate}} mechanisms: energy and heat. When too much energy {{is used for}} the pulse duration, structural failure of the glass envelope can occur. Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube. As the arc develops, a supersonic shock-wave forms, traveling radially {{from the center of the}} arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube. If the energy level is low enough, a tap against the glass is all that will be heard. However, if the energy level used equals the [...] "explosion energy" [...] rating of the lamp, the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass, rupturing the tube. The resulting explosion creates a loud, sonic shock-wave, and may throw shattered glass several feet. The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp, between the electrodes, with the power-loading capacity of the glass. Power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass, and the cooling method that is used. Power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared. However, because the pulsed-power level increases as the <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> decreases, the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time.|$|E
40|$|Delivery of intense, brief {{flashes of}} {{monochromatic}} light are required in single-cell physiological experiments to photolyze cellular chromophores or pigments. In the xenon flash instrument constructed, flashes are collimated, made monochromatic with selectable bandpass filters and imaged into a small-core fiber. The flash is transmitted over meters to the epiflourescent port of a microscope where additional optics again collimate the beam. The objective {{lens of the}} microscope functions to condense flash energy into a microbeam in the specimen (field) plane and to image the cell under parafocal conditions. Spot diameters are 228 and 166 μm (full width half maximum) for 40 × 40 × and 60 × 60 × objectives. Flash intensities can be measured with this instrument during experiments using the microscope phase/differential interference contrast condenser to couple the microbeam to a calibrated photodiode.

40|$|In Photinus fireflies, males produce {{spontaneous}} bioluminescent courtship flashes. Females preferentially {{respond to}} particular male flashes with flashes of their own. This study explored variation in female flash responsiveness {{as a function}} of male <b>flash</b> <b>duration,</b> female condition, lantern size, and lantern distance, as well as the relationship between male characteristics and spermatophore mass in Photinus ignitus fireflies. We determined female preference by scoring female flash response to simulated male flashes and determined variation in overall female flash responsiveness for laboratory-mated, laboratory-fed, and control P. ignitus females. <b>Flash</b> <b>duration,</b> lantern size, and body mass were recorded for field-collected males. Males were then mated to determine spermatophore mass. Females exhibited greater preference for artificial flashes representing the upper range of conspecific male <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> and lantern size as well as flashes produced at a closer distance. Both laboratory-mated and laboratory-fed P. ignitus females showed lower overall responsiveness across all flash durations relative to control females that did not mate or feed in the laboratory. Male <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> predicted a significant proportion of the variation in spermatophore mass for early-season males. These results suggest that female Photinus ignitus may prefer long flashes in order to obtain the direct benefit of larger spermatophores and may adjust their overall flash responsiveness as the relative importance of this benefit varies with changing female condition.

40|$|The {{design of}} 6 ½” arc length, xenon filled flash tubes capable of {{withstanding}} energy inputs up to 10000 joules is described. The lamp performance is investigated {{as a function}} of filling pressure, bore size of lamp between 10 mm and 15 mm, operating voltage, energy input and circuit parameters. The lamp life has been related to input energy, <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> and the inner wall area of the lamp. Above a given lamp wall loading, the lamp is likely to shatter in the first few discharges. Lamp efficiency, measurements show that for a fixed capacitor bank, operating voltage variation between 1. 0 and 2. 4 kV does not change the efficiency and that the efficiency is lower when a lamp is lightly loaded. <b>Flash</b> <b>duration</b> is almost independent of bank voltage and tube bore. The peak light intensity is increased and the <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> decreased by a factor 2 when the lamp series inductance is changed from 450 μH to 100 μH.

The laser performance does not necessarily depend on the rod optical quality. Measurements of the variation of laser performance with lamp operating parameters show a linear relationship between output energy and input energy above laser threshold. For maximum efficiency, the lamp should be operated with a low bank capacity, a high bank voltage and short <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> provided the lamp wall loading limit is not exceeded.

An increase of flagellar beating frequency occurs when the flash dose (flash intensity × <b>flash</b> <b>duration)</b> is sufficient. Reciprocity between light intensity and <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> holds for durations not exceeding 60 - 80 ms. For lower doses a bimodal distribution of flagellar beating frequency is revealed.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the state of}} adaptation of the eye on the Broca-Sulzer phenomenon has been investigated by measuring equal-brightness curves as a function of <b>flash</b> <b>duration</b> for circular 1 °-fields, projected against a photopic and a dark background. The results show that the Broca-Sulzer effect is present in both conditions. In the dark-field condition the Broca-Sulzer effect was found to shift to shorter durations with increasing flash luminance. For flashes presented against the photopic background, however, this shift is absent. Furthermore, the equalbrightness curves were found to be isomorphous. They coincide after translation along the luminance axis in the photopic background condition and after translation along the duration and luminance axes in the dark-field condition. It is argued that both the isomorphism of the equal-brightness curves and the absence of the shift in the photopic background condition confirm our earlier conclusion (De Ridder 2 ̆ 6 amp; Theelen, 1983, 1984) that the exponent of the power function, relating brightness to luminance, is independent of <b>flash</b> <b>duration.</b> The shift of the Broca-Sulzer effect in the dark-field condition is attributed to disturbances of the adaptation level...|$|E

40|$|The {{shapes of}} {{fluorescence}} induction curves in spinach chloroplasts, measured using double-flash pump-probe techniques, are shown {{to depend on}} the duration of the actinic <b>flashes.</b> For <b>flash</b> <b>durations</b> τ 0 ≤ 2 μs, the variable fluorescence Fν grows exponentially (or nearly so) with increasing fluence J of the actinic pulses and the fluorescence induction ratio R = Fmax/F 0 is ≤ 2. 6. When τo ≥ 50 μs, the shapes of the Fν vs. J curves are sigmoidal, and R > 3. 2. Overall, the experimentally observed trends suggest that, as the duration τ 0 of the actinic pulses is increased, the degree of sigmoidicity, the deduced values of the interunit excitation transfer parameter p, and the fluorescence induction ratios R, also tend to increase. These results can be accounted for in terms of a simple double-photon hit model in which a dark lag time τ 1 = 0. 4 - 10 μs between the two hits is necessary for the observance of sigmoidal fluorescence induction curves and relatively high R ratios. It is shown that, in principle, such a model can account for the exponential and sigmoidal shapes of the fluorescence induction curves either {{within the context of a}} lake model of the photosynthetic antenna bed (free transfer of excitation between photosynthetic units) or the isolated (puddle) model of photosystem II reaction centers.
