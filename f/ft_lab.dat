40|$|This single-center {{retrospective}} pilot program’s {{objective was}} to utilize outpatient pharmacists to improve laboratory test adherence in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients overdue for thyroid function testing, thereby demonstrating {{the value of the}} outpatient pharmacist and justifying possible clinical role expansion. Thyroid disorders may contribute to CHF development, pro-gression, and exacerbation. Testing is the standard of care in CHF patients per American Heart Association’s 2009 Guidelines. Delinquency was defined as labs not conducted within 1 year in patients with euthyroid history, within 6 months in patients with thyroid dysfunction, abnormal labs at any time without follow-up, or lab absence after thyroid medication initiation, adjustment, or discontinuation. Targeted 80 nonpregnant adult CHF patients with delinquent thyroid function tests were counseled to get thyr-oid labs at point of sale, via telephone, e-mail, or letter. In collaboration with physicians, pharmacists ordered thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T 4 (<b>FT</b> 4) <b>labs.</b> For patients with abnormal laboratory results, pharmacists coordinated drug therapy and follow-up labs. Data were collected fromNovember 1, 2009 to March 30, 2010. Seventy-two patients (90 %) previously delinquent for thyroid function testing received relevant thyroid labs. Ten patients (12. 5 %) with abnormal thyroid function tests not on prior drug therapy received treatment...|$|R

40|$|Tumbling mills {{describe}} {{a class of}} mechanical systems defined by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotates around its own longitudinal axis. This class of mechanical systems is used to grind to a desired quality different material {{in at least three}} industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries (ore, clinker and metal powder). These tumbling mills range in size from small 1 <b>ft</b> diameter <b>lab</b> mills to a 40 ft diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are composed of three main interactive and interdependent elements: the mill shell, liners/lifters and charge. These three elements work together to impact energy to the mill charge through the rotational motion of the mill shell. As with any mechanical system, the natural frequency of that system is essentially dictated by its mass and stiffness. In the case of a tumbling mill, a rotating system, the natural frequency of a given mill, as seen by a stationary observer, is also a function of the rotation speed. The aim of this paper The consequence for a rotating mill, and for that matter any rotating system, is that if the natural frequency of the mill should happen to match the operating rotating speed of the mill, resonance of the mill will occur. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the effect of mill diameter, length on mill natural frequencies as well as outline further work...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{production}} systems provide bioregenerative technologies to complement human crew life support requirements on long duration space missions. Kennedy Space Center has lead NASA's research on crop {{production systems}} that produce high value fresh foods, provide atmospheric regeneration, and perform water processing. As {{the emphasis on}} early missions to Mars has developed, our research focused on modular, scalable systems for transit missions, which can be developed into larger autonomous, bioregenerative systems for subsequent surface missions. Components of these scalable systems will include development of efficient light generating or collecting technologies, low mass plant growth chambers, and capability {{to operate in the}} high energy background radiation and reduced atmospheric pressures of space. These systems will be integrated with air, water, and thermal subsystems in an operational system. Extensive crop testing has been done for both staple and salad crops, but limited data is available on specific cultivar selection and breadboard testing to meet nominal Mars mission profiles of a 500 - 600 day surface mission. The recent research emphasis at Kennedy Space Center has shifted from staple crops, such as wheat, soybean and rice, toward short cycle salad crops such as lettuce, onion, radish, tomato, pepper, and strawberry. This paper will review the results of crop experiments to support the Exploration Initiative and the ongoing development of supporting technologies, and give an overview of capabilities of the newly opened Space Life Science (SLS) Lab at Kennedy Space Center. The 9662 square m (104, 000 square <b>ft)</b> SLS <b>Lab</b> was built by the State of Florida and supports all NASA research that had been performed in Hanger-L. In addition to NASA research, the SLS Lab houses the Florida Space Research Institute (FSRI), responsible for co-managing the facility, and the University of Florida (UF) has established the Space Agriculture and Biotechnology Research and Education (SABRE) Center with several faculty...|$|R
40|$|In mineral {{processing}} industries, grinding processes {{can be defined}} as the particles reduced in size by a combination of impact and abrasion. It is performed in tumbling mills that describe a class of mills delimited by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotate around its longitudinal axis. Tumbling mills, whether they are autogenous, semi-autogenous, ball or rod, are classed according {{to the nature of the}} discharge as centre peripheral discharge mills, end peripheral discharge mills, overflow mills, and grate discharge mills. These mills are used in at least three industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries to grind different materials (ore, clinker and metal powder) to desired quality specifications as principally described by a size distribution. These tumbling mills range in size from small 0. 3 m diameter lab mills to a 16 m diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are driven by chain and sprocket (lab mills), gear and pinion (pilot and industrial scale mills) and gearless drives in very large diameter mill (8 to 12 m dia.). All of these mill drives present advantages and limitations. In this thesis, we focus on the design and development of a cam-driven laboratory ball mill. An alternative drive system is presented that uses a newly patented speed-o-cam technology and applies it to a 5 <b>ft</b> diameter <b>lab</b> mill. We introduce polynomials to modify the cam profile around both the cusp and the blunt point of the profile to improve pressure angle and shock impact. We build models of mechanical systems, simulate the full-motion behavior of the models, and analyze multiple design variations. We integrate the theoretical, virtual and experimental analyses in order to design an optimal mechanical system. Moreover, the analysis of static and dynamic forces of cam mechanism is reported in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} tension (IFT) that arises at {{the interface between}} water and an immiscible organic liquid is a key parameter affecting the transport and subsequent fate of the organic liquid in water-saturated porous media. In this paper, data are presented that show how contact between a range of soil types and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent (CHS) dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) can affect DNAPL/water IFT values. The soils examined are indicative of U. K. soil types and shallow aquifer materials. The solvents investigated were tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). Lab grade, recovered field DNAPL and industrial waste chlorinated solvent mixtures were used. The data from batch and column experiments invariably revealed that water/DNAPL IFT values change following contact with unsaturated soils. In the majority of cases, the IFT values increase following soil exposure. However, after contact with an organic-rich soil, the I <b>FT</b> of the <b>lab</b> grade solvents decreased. The experimental evidence suggests that these reductions {{are linked to the}} removal of organic material from the soil and its subsequent incorporation into the solvent. IFT increases in the case of lab solvents are shown to be linked to the removal of stabilizers (added by the manufacturers to obviate degradation) that are removed by adsorption to soil mineral surfaces. Similarly, it is conjectured that adsorption of surface-active compounds from the industrial waste samples to soil surfaces is responsible for increases in the IFT in these samples. Finally, it was observed that invading CHSs are capable of dissolving and subsequently mobilizing in-situ soil contaminants. GC/MS analysis revealed these mobilized soil contaminants to be polyaromatic hydrocarbons and phthalate esters...|$|R
