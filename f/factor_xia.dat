40|$|Increasing inflows {{of foreign}} {{investment}} particularly {{in the real estate}} sector in the early 1990 s, has contributed to the building up of “bubble” in the economies of several Asian countries. In 2004, house prices increased rapidly in several countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore (World Report, 2004). The rapid increase in prices has led economists to believe that a ‘bubble’ has form in the housing market. A housing market bubble occurs when house price increases are not justified by macroeconomic fundamentals and other underlying <b>factors</b> (<b>Xia</b> and Tan 2006). The effect of housing bubble bursts is seen in the loss of value to owners of capital, increase unemployment, slowing down of the economy particularly in housing-related sector. This study empirically test whether a bubble exist in the Malaysian Housing Market for the period 1990 to 2004. Using a general to specific approach from a simple multivariate liner regression model (OLS) to more sophisticated models such as Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Vector AutoRegression (VAR), regime-switching (Markov-Switching),GARCH model and MS-GARCH, our result suggests that a semi-rational bubble does exist in the Malaysian housing market in 1997 :Q 1 to 1998 :Q 2. The deviations or fluctuations of the Malaysian House Price Index cannot be explained by the macroeconomic fundamental variables such as income, interest rate and inflation. Furthermore, the result also implies that Malaysian housing market is inefficient market due to the slow adjustment process towards its long run equilibrium price. The mean and variance of the MHPI is significantly different in the two states (boom and burst) which suggest that the Malaysian housing market had experienced a boom and bust of house price bubble prior to the occurrence of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The results of switching model approach support the changing behaviour of MHPI in different economic states, implying possible existence of bubbles in the Malaysian housing market...|$|R

The potentiation of prekallikrein activation occurred over a 12 -fold range of enzyme (HFf) concentration and was nonhyperbolic with respect to substrate (prekallikrein).

Associations between both cascades have been proposed, but the precise molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The current study reports multiple links for various factors of the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades with the central complement components C 3 and C 5 in vitro and ex vivo. Thrombin, human coagulation <b>factors</b> (F) <b>XIa,</b> Xa, and IXa, and plasmin were all found to effectively cleave C 3 and C 5. Mass spectrometric analyses identified the cleavage products as C 3 a and C 5 a, displaying identical molecular weights as the native anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a. Cleavage products also exhibited robust chemoattraction of human mast cells and neutrophils, respectively. Enzymatic activity for C 3 cleavage by the investigated clotting and fibrinolysis factors is defined in the following order: FXa > plasmin > thrombin > FIXa > FXIa > control. Furthermore, FXa-induced cleavage of C 3 was significantly suppressed {{in the presence of the}} selective FXa inhibitors fondaparinux and enoxaparin in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of FXa to human serum or plasma activated complement ex vivo, represented by the generation of C 3 a, C 5 a, and the terminal complement complex, and decreased complement hemolytic serum activity that defines exact serum concentration that results in complement-mediated lysis of 50 % of sensitized sheep erythrocytes.

To quantify <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> plasma levels, we developed a new thrombin generation based assay and hypothesized that in AMI patients <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> levels are increased during the acute thrombotic event. MethodsA prospective cohort study was performed including 56 patients with first AMI. Blood was collected upon admission and after 6 months. Reference blood samples were obtained from 30 apparently healthy control subjects. Plasma samples were diluted (1 : 5) in factor XI deficient plasma and <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> plasma levels were established using a reference curve (0 - 12. 5 pM <b>factor</b> <b>XIa)</b> and an inhibitory anti-factor XIa antibody. The established FXIa concentrations were related to the 1 -year outcome. ResultsFactor XIa plasma concentrations were significantly increased in AMI patients on admission compared to 6 months after the event (3. 7 pM [2. 7 - 5. 5] vs. 2. 8 [1. 9 - 4. 3], median±IQR; P= 0. 001) and compared to healthy controls (3. 7 pM [2. 7 - 5. 5] vs. 2. 7 [1. 6 - 4. 2], median±IQR; P= 0. 004).

This ultimately leads to anticoagulation effect by inhibiting activation of prothrombin. GNP-based assay will be used as a system to study the interaction between factor IX and factor IX-bp and to compare the interaction between thrombin and factor IX-bp (Fig.  2 b).|$|R
40|$|Three new marine alkaloids, clavatadines C-E (1 - 3), {{together}} with the three known compounds aerophobin 1 (4), purealdin L (5), and aplysinamisine II (6) were isolated from extracts of the sponge Suberea claVata by bioassay-guided fractionation using a serine protease <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> assay. Their structures were determined by 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 - 6 exhibited weak inhibition of <b>factor</b> <b>XIa.</b> No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease has}} quickly {{become a major}} health concern in the United States, with {{numerous}} citizens dying from cardiovascular disease each year. Older medications, while effective against cardiovascular disease, are problematic to prescribe. A recently isolated natural product, clavatadine A, selectively inhibits human blood coagulation <b>factor</b> <b>XIa.</b> As a result, the synthesis and biological testing of clavatadine A and synthetic clavatadine A analogues that selectively inhibit <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> would represent a new direction in cardiovascular disease research. A potent and selective <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> inhibitor {{has the potential to}} be a safer replacement for current anticoagulants, such as Warfarin, Pradaxa®, Eliquis®, and Xarelto®. The first total synthesis of clavatadine A was recently completed. Clavatadine A binds irreversibly to the active site of factor XIa; therefore, a primary goal of this research is to design an analogue of clavatadine A that is a selective, reversible <b>factor</b> <b>XIa</b> inhibitor. The general approach developed for the synthesis of guanidine containing natural products was used to attempt to prepare several synthetic analogues of clavatadine A. First, the original four analogues of clavatadine A that included a urea, reverse carbamate and two amide analogues were attempted in hopes to synthesize an analogue that was less likely to form a covalent bond with Ser- 195 in the active site of <b>factor</b> <b>XIa.</b> Phase two analogues were also attempted when the orginal four analogues did not work out as planned. Phase two included attempting to make a five carbon clavatadine A...|$|E
