Through {{an analysis of the}} gay bashing that took place within the legislative debate, Professor Kogan argues that the Utah legislature 2 ̆ 7 s removal of all references to <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians in the legislation was significant both because it reinforced sterotypical and negative perceptions of <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians, and because it suggested that violence against <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians was, at best, not of concern to, and at worst, actively encouraged by, the state. While Professor Kogan 2 ̆ 7 s paper raises a number of interesting issues, I would like to focus on some of the broader themes concerning law and violence raised by the many ways we might interpret hate crimes statutes in the context of violence against <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians...|$|R
