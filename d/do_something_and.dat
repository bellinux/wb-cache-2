5|$|Claiborne made no overt legal {{attempts}} to re-assert control over Kent Island during the commission's rule of Maryland, although a treaty concluded {{during that time}} with the Susquehannocks claimed that Claiborne owned both Kent and Palmer Islands. Claiborne's legal designs on Maryland were once again defeated when Oliver Cromwell returned Calvert to power in 1653, after the Rump Parliament ended. In 1654, Governor Stone of Maryland tried to reclaim authority for the proprietor and declared that Claiborne's property and his life could be taken at the Governor's pleasure. Stone's declaration was ignored and Claiborne and Bennett again overthrew him, creating a new assembly in which Catholics {{were not allowed to}} serve. Calvert, now angry at Stone for what he perceived as weakness, demanded that Stone <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> in 1655 Stone reclaimed control in St. Mary's and led a group of soldiers to Providence (modern Annapolis). Stone was captured and his force defeated by local Puritan settlers, who took control of the colony. Given the new situation, Claiborne and Bennett went to England in hopes of convincing Cromwell to change his mind but, to their dismay, no decision was made and, lacking royal authority, the Puritans gave power over to a new governor appointed by Calvert. Going behind Claiborne's back, Bennett and another commissioner reached an agreement with Calvert that virtually guaranteed his continued control over Maryland through the remainder of the Protectorate.|$|E

25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during a news conference on 15 November 2001. When sculptor Douwe Blumberg saw that image, he felt impressed {{that he had to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> created what became the only public sculpture to commemorate special forces, America's Response Monument.|$|E

However, the First World War is on and all the men are fighting at the four corners of the empire and therefore can not respond to the appeal. The young children of Van want to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> when the principal of a school, who has lost a son in the war, suggests that they transport ammunition, 120 young boys aged 12 to 17 volunteer and take to the road. The movie tells the true story of the 120 boys and their sisters and mothers left behind, who wait for their return.|$|E
500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> she would react, he would <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E

Usher also while in New Orleans would meet with students from Dillard and Xavier to aid them with cleaning up the city. [...] "I'm here to physically <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> hopefully motivate other people to do the same," [...] said Usher in an interview. Usher, because of his efforts and dedication to helping the city of New Orleans rebuild was presented the key to the city of New Orleans in 2008 from former Mayor Ray Nagin. Also in this presentation, Usher in his honor was proclaimed his own day, Usher Day.|$|E
500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe and get away with it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Garland {{entered the}} season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's {{basketball}} roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in 2012–13, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on [...]500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against Manhattan. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with {{minutes left in the}} game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against Quinnipiac at the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, [...] "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the game today was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> then you learn from it and do better, so I am pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against Morgan State, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs VCU. His team's 10-point 2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to St. Bonaventure, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.|$|E
2500|$|Martinez {{has been}} {{presented}} with an award for helping bullied children. He has also championed the cause of domestic violence against women. He attended a news conference to support legislation involving the Violence Against Women Act. Martinez was quoted as saying: [...] "With domestic violence, {{no one wanted to}} touch the subject with a 10-foot pole. I was interested in the issue that a boxer, who dishes out violence, could also be thoughtful and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> people would listen to someone like me. I thought I could have the most impact by speaking out on the issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Harris, {{the head}} of the casting {{department}} refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a [...] "scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes." [...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's not like I [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> then they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other Halloween movies, who cares?"...

2500|$|In the film, Hugo and his {{grandfather}} were supposed to [...] "travel to a diamond moon" [...] and the storyboards showed Hugo battling Scylla in space. The plot premise was described by Helbrandt as following: [...] "Afskyelia [...] have obtained a way to threaten Hugo and his forest friends. Therefore Hugo has to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> when he discovers a moon behind the moon we know today, he will set forth. Afskyelia chases after him. But I promise you, that unfortunately for her, the story is to end happily." [...] The movie's basic plot premise resembles the educational game Hugo in Space, which was released in 2003, {{one year after the}} planned release of the movie. In this game, she plans to extract the rare magical black diamonds (first introduced in an action game [...] in 2002) from an asteroid's core and become the most powerful witch of all time.|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger continues, [...] "Perhaps {{they were}} saying they wished they {{could be on the}} front lines, but were not {{in the right place at}} the right time; perhaps {{they were saying}}, as John Lennon did in the Beatles' [...] "Revolution", that they didn't want to be {{involved}} in violent confrontation. Or perhaps they were even declaring indifference to the tumult." [...] Other writers' interpretations varied. [...] In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a [...] "great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as 'Summer in the City', 'Summertime Blues', and 'Dancing in the Street'." [...] In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that it was the keynote of Beggars Banquet, [...] "with its teasing admonition to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers." ...|$|E
2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E

2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not {{as young as}} I used to be, what am I {{going to do with}} myself? I don't have eternity to stay here so I need to get up and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
