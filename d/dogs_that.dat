5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> {{can be seen as}} family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dogs</b> <b>that</b> are {{employed}} to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, {{and are often}} proposed {{as one of the}} non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves. Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation, especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock-guarding dogs. However, shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat.

However, dual champions, or <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E
5|$|St George's, Hanover Square was {{constructed}} between 1721–4 by John James, {{as one of}} 50 new churches following the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches Act in 1711.

5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|The first French Spaniel is speculated to have {{appeared}} following the Crusades of the 11th century, {{and it was}} these breeds of <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> were described in Gaston III of Foix-Béarn's 14th-century work Livre de Chasse. Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs. This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions, which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E
5|$|The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs {{of today}} are all descended from dogs of that period, {{although}} documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 {{have not been}} found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell {{as one of the}} founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then.

5|$|Whippet rags were {{a popular}} Sunday {{event in the}} north and Midlands at the time. There were also {{international}} events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hare, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races. Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> could win races. Many racing dogs were part terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{appeared}} in four films in 2012, including the critically acclaimed The Place Beyond the Pines and Silver Linings Playbook. His {{performance in the}} latter in particular was widely praised, and earned him nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor, among other awards. Cooper's profile continued to expand as he took on major roles in several successful films—American Hustle (2013), Guardians of the Galaxy, and American Sniper (both in 2014). After receiving Academy Award nominations for American Hustle and American Sniper, he became the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Cooper returned to stage work for a 2014 Broadway production of The Elephant Man, where he played the severely deformed Joseph Merrick. His performance drew praise from critics, and earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. None of his 2015 films—Aloha, Burnt, or Joy—performed particularly well at the box office. In 2016, he {{appeared in}} the comedy drama War <b>Dogs</b> <b>that</b> he also co-produced under his and Philips' production company, Joint Effort.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use <b>dogs</b> <b>that</b> were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
