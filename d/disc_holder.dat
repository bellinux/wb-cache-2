Aug. 17, 2015), is a 2015 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the rights of end users who purchase products subject to fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) licensing under an industry-wide patent pool of standards-essential patents, and of suppliers of software to the end users. The Federal Circuit held that, where the patent holder had authorized sales to end users of optical discs compliant with the standard, which embodied the patents' essential features and were reasonably intended only {{to be used to}} practice the patents, the patent owner had no direct infringement claim against the end users without proof that the end-users were using unlicensed <b>discs.</b> The patent <b>holder</b> therefore had no claim for contributory infringement or induced infringement against a software company for selling software to the end users for use with the licensed discs. The decision is said to be an important one for clarifying the rights of downstream users and their suppliers in the context of patent pools and FRAND licensing.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the launch}} of the first {{prototype}} [...] "Goronta" [...] CD player by Sony at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the vertical loading design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including Alpine/Luxman, Matsushita under the Technics brand, Kenwood and Toshiba/Aurex. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman, Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their [...] "Sigma Drive" [...] outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site. The vertical loading is similar the one common in cassette decks, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the <b>disc</b> <b>holder</b> as it closes.|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric discs are {{commonly}} used when generating ultrasonic waves for measurement and investigation purposes. The electronics needed for a complete ultrasonic measurement system can be realized as an integrated circuit. For several reasons, it is advantageous to mount the circuitry physically {{as close to the}} piezoelectric disc as possible, thus creating a small and compact unit. One solution is to mount the chip containing the electronics directly on the back-side of the disc. This will however present a non-uniform mechanical load at the rear side of the disc. The purpose of this master's thesis is to investigate the influence of a mechanical load on the radiated sound field generated by the piezoelectric disc. In the presented study, a laboratory setup was designed and built to perform an experimental study on the effect of the radiated field from different mechanical loadings of the disc. Piezoelectric discs of Pz 27 material were used in generating an ultrasonic field. The discs were mounted in an elastic frame to provide a setup that, as close as possible, will allow the disc to move freely in the axial direction. The <b>disc</b> and <b>holder</b> were immersed in a temperature controlled water tank. The ultrasonic field was measured using a ultrasonic hydrophone and a 3 -D scanning system. The data collection, scanning and processing of the collected data was performed using MatlabTM. Comparisons are presented between unloaded and loaded discs in the far field. A study of loaded discs in the near field is also presented. A comparison shows that the prescence of the load on the disc does not significantly affect the 2 -D shape of the radial energy density. However, the resonant frequency of the disc is shifted and an increase of the transmitted acoustic energy is found in the recorded signal. In the near field, an effect from the wraparound connection is distinguished. All measurements are commented and presented. Recommendations for further investigations are given.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{describes}} friction properties of sintered copper alloy journal bearing. Sulfide contained copper alloy material studied as {{the material of}} the journal bearing. The micro structure of the copper alloy was consisted from micro sized pores and sulfide phase mainly dispersed at the boundary region. For the purpose of friction study, the sliding surface of the journal bearing was {{in the form of}} machined texture. A spiral groove was applied to the inner surface of the journal and graphite was occasionally penetrated into the groove. The experiment was carried out using a developed testing apparatus that consists of a spindle driven with an air cooled DC motor and a <b>disc</b> shape bearing <b>holder</b> in air atmosphere without lubricants. The hardened steel shaft having fine ground surface was used as the mating specimen. The results found that the application of spiral groove with graphite penetration was effective to increase the sliding distance up to the occurrence of seizure. In particular, the graphite penetration resulted in significant increase in the sliding distance despite that the decrease in friction coefficient. It was estimated that the application of the groove with graphite penetration restricted the transfer of the journal elements on the mating steel surface...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{reported}} on a small grid-connected thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system consisting of an ytterbia mantle emitter and silicon solar cells with a 16 % efficiency (under solar irradiance at standard test conditions, STC). The emitter was heated using a butane burner with a rated thermal power of 1. 35 kW (referring to the lower heating value). This system produced an electrical output of 15 W, which corresponds to a thermal to electric (direct current) conversion efficiency of 1. 1 %. In the interim, further progress has been made, and significantly higher efficiencies have been achieved. The most important developments are:- (1) The infrared radiation-absorbing water filter between the emitter and silicon cells (to protect the cells against overheating) {{has been replaced by}} a suitable glass tube. By doing this, it has been possible to prevent losses of convertible radiation in the water, and to protect the cells against the flue gasses. (2) Cell cooling has been significantly improved, in order to reduce the cell temperature, and therefore increase the conversion efficiency. (3) The shape of the emitter has been changed from spherical to a quasi-cylindrical geometry, in order to obtain a more homogeneous irradiation of the cells. (4) The metallic burner-tube, on which the ytterbia emitter was fixed in the initial prototypes, {{has been replaced by a}} heat-resistant metallic rod, carrying ceramic <b>discs</b> as emitter <b>holders.</b> This has prevented the oxidation and clogging of the perforated burner tube. (5) Larger reflectors have been used to reduce losses of useful infrared radiation. (6) Smaller cells have been used, to reduce the electrical series-resistance losses. A system efficiency of 1. 5 % was attained by applying all these improvements to the basic 1. 35 kW prototype. By using preheated air for combustion (at approximately 370 Â Â°C), 1. 8 % was achieved. In a subsequent step, a photocell generator was constructed, consisting of high-efficiency silicon cells (21 % STC efficiency). In this generator, the spaces between the cells were minimized, in order to achieve as high an active cell area as possible, while simultaneously reducing radiation losses. This new system has produced an electrical output of 48 W, corresponding to a system efficiency of 2. 4 %. This is the highest-ever-reported value in a silicon-cell-based TPV system using ytterbia mantle emitters. An efficiency of 2. 8 % was achieved by using preheated air (at approximately 350 Â Â°C). An electronic control unit (fabricated of components with low power consumptions, and including a battery store) was developed, in order to make the TPV system self-powered. This unit controls the magnetic gas-supply valve between the gas-supply cylinder and burner as well as the high-voltage ignition electrodes. Both the control unit's own power consumption and the battery-charging power are supplied directly by the TPV generator. A small commercial inverter is used to transfer excess power to the 230 V grid. In future systems, the effect of preheating the combustion air will be studied in more detail. Finally, this system will be scaled up to provide self-powered domestic boilers.

50|$|The entire game {{takes place}} in the mythical land of Perathia. It is a vast world that is split into six {{elemental}} realms, one for each elemental force. In the center is Town, the hub of the elemental realms and home of Azurik and the Temple of the Elements. The temple consists of a tall tower with four floors. The first floor has two elevators leading to the next floor and {{in the center of the}} room is a gate to the Life realm, which will become active when the Azurik gains three of the four missing pieces of the Life disc. The second floor contains another elevator in the center of the room which leads to the third floor. Around the elevator are ten objects that Azurik can gain each time he collects ten or more obsidian jewels. The third floor is an empty room with three elevators that lead to the top floor. The top floor is where the elemental discs were held prior to Balthazar's betrayal. The <b>disc</b> <b>holder</b> comprises a machine in the center with different colored lights indicating where each disc is put. On the grounds of the temple are four large objects representing each element. A floating spherical rock represents the earth realm, a complicated fan system represents the air realm, a bowl of lava represents the fire realm, and a large fountain represents the water realm. Each object will do a specific function once Azurik has completely restored a disc and put it in its proper place. There is no specific time period mentioned in the game, but the architecture and the opening movie suggest a time of primitive technology, although some signs of advanced machines like large drills, tunnel borers, generators, conveyor belts, mine carts, and electrical equipment are seen throughout the realms and the Temple of the Elements.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGas-assisted {{injection}} molding involves the injection {{of a short}} shot of resin into the mold cavity and followed by injection of nitrogen gas under high pressure through the nozzle or mold wall. Gas-assisted {{injection molding}} {{is a relatively new}} process with good compatibility with the conventional injection molding process. It offers a lot of benefits to the manufacturing of polymer products, such as reduced molded-in part stress, less warpage, reduced or no sink, and greater design freedom. The product chosen as a case study for this work is CD-Rom tray, which is a thin plastic <b>disc</b> <b>holder</b> that allows a disc to be inserted into the optics reader. The material that is being used to manufacture CD-Rom tray is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The gas-assisted injection molding was simulated using a commercial computer aided engineering software dedicated for injection molding. This study intends to obtain the optimum parameters when five processing parameters were varied, which are melt injection time, gas delay time, melt temperature, mold temperature, and gas injection pressure. The quality characteristics concerned in this study are volumetric shrinkage, warpage, and weld line. Based on the study, the optimum parameters setting for the CD-Rom tray manufacturing is low level in melt injection time, melt temperature and mold temperature while high level in gas delay time and gas injection pressure. By using the optimum parameters setting, the production time and cost can be greatly reduced...|$|E
