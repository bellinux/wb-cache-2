5|$|Buchanan County brought ASL to Grundy {{in order}} to revitalize a town {{that had been in}} a steady {{economic}} decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area. ASL has become a success story for the concept of higher education as an economic development tool. The school has brought in $12 million per year to the local economy. ASL's economic success spurred the conception and implementation of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy (formerly University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy), which was founded in 2003 and opened its doors in 2005.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E

25|$|These {{varieties}} {{are often used}} today for bulk jug wine sold in 1 liter cardboard cartons or as grape concentrate which is exported worldwide with Japan being a considerably large market. In the late 20th century, as the Argentine wine industry shifted it focus on premium wine production capable for export, Malbec arose to greater prominence and is today the most widely planted red grape variety followed by Bonarda, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Tempranillo. The influence of Italian immigrants <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> variety of Italian varietals with sizable plantings throughout Argentina-including Barbera, Dolcetto, Freisa, Lambrusco, Nebbiolo, Raboso and Sangiovese.|$|E

Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying there was no way they could stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A moment later, Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back. The lovers embrace; sensuality fills the air.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

500|$|Opposition to Morales' {{governance}} {{has centered}} in the wealthy eastern lowland province of Santa Cruz. His policies often antagonized middle-class Bolivians, who deemed them too radical and argued that they threatened private property. Morales' discourse of [...] "the people" [...] against the socio-economic elites <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> spotlight on the deep social polarization in Bolivia. His most vociferous critics have been from Bolivia's conservative movement, although he has also received criticism from the country's far left, who believe his reformist policies have been insufficiently radical or socialist.|$|E
500|$|Like many reviewers of Angelou's poetry, Ellen Lippmann of School Library Journal finds Angelou's prose {{stronger}} than her poetry, but found her strength more {{apparent in the}} poems in this volume {{than it was in}} her first autobiography. [...] Mary Silva Cosgrave, in her review in Horn Book Magazine, praises Angelou for finding rhythm in everyday life and is impressed with the poems in And Still I Rise, especially [...] "Phenomenal Woman"; Cosgrave states, [...] "To her third collection of poems the author <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> life full of zest and style that is phenomenally her own". [...] Harold Bloom states that although [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] has received few reviews, {{it is one of the}} most popular and powerful poems Angelou recites in her public appearances.|$|E
