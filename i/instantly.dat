5|$|All healing items, {{including}} {{food and}} water, do not heal the player <b>instantly,</b> but work over {{a short period}} of time. RadAway also takes time to gradually decrease radiation poisoning, rather than <b>instantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|O'Connor then apologised <b>instantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evan grows a beard that <b>instantly</b> reappears {{no matter}} how many times he shaves.|$|E
5|$|Life After People {{shows what}} would happen if humans {{disappeared}} <b>instantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nachi Nozawa voices Professor Hojo, {{the head}} of Shinra's science department. Hojo takes Zack and Cloud for experimentation, <b>instantly</b> dismissing Tseng's discontent about using them.|$|E
5|$|At 03:30 on 29 April a PAVN rocket hit Guardpost 1 at the DAO Compound, <b>instantly</b> killing Marine Corporals McMahon and Judge. They {{were the}} last American ground {{casualties}} in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At the RR Diner, Hurley meets Madeline Ferguson (Lee), Laura's {{identical}} cousin; the two seem <b>instantly</b> smitten. Norma {{finds out}} that Hank has been released from prison; that evening Packard receives a brief phone call from him that leaves her shaken.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is <b>instantly</b> oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to <b>instantly</b> form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} <b>instantly</b> ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) <b>instantly</b> evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that <b>instantly</b> becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 3 weeks the HouseGuest competed in their cliques in the Have/Have Not competition. The HoH's clique did not compete {{as they would}} <b>instantly</b> be haves for the week.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded by foes, Philip {{was forced}} to adopt a {{defensive}} policy. He distributed his commanders and forces {{and set up a}} system of beacon fires at various high places to communicate <b>instantly</b> any enemy movements.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{also found}} that while Perizzolo died almost <b>instantly,</b> Aylwin may have survived for up to 39 hours after the collapse, {{and may have been}} found alive if HUSAR had not {{suspended}} its rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|The time {{of death}} is also much discussed; one version claims that the poison was so potent that he died <b>instantly,</b> while another says that he endured agony until dawn of the {{following}} day. It {{has been suggested that}} Claudius may have died as late as noon on 13 October.|$|E
5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz boosts. These {{can be thought}} of, in the passive view, as (<b>instantly!)</b> giving the coordinate system (and with it the observer) a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
5|$|Ward {{eventually}} finds Amador's goal: {{a mysterious}} diagram {{in a room}} of the Todorov Building. Coulson tracks down Amador's handler, but he is killed <b>instantly</b> by his own prosthetic eye. Amador is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, and though Coulson promises to testify for her, she is {{just happy to be}} free.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow <b>instantly.</b> The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
5|$|All 320 {{of the men}} on duty at {{the pier}} died <b>instantly,</b> and 390 civilians and {{military}} personnel were injured, many seriously. Among the dead were all five Coast Guard personnel posted aboard the fire barge. African Americans suffered 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American naval casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked quickly to contain the fires and to prevent other explosions. Injuries were treated, those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 1:43p.m. CST (19:43 UTC), Hawkins {{stepped out}} of the elevator on the third floor and opened fire. He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near the customer service desk. He fired more than 30 rounds, striking 12 people. Six were killed <b>instantly,</b> one died before reaching the hospital, and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont almost <b>instantly</b> {{became a}} boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation {{participating}} in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and other areas of the United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|Bourdon {{was killed}} <b>instantly</b> in a {{motorcycle}} collision in Lamèque, New Brunswick, near {{his hometown of}} Shippagan on May 29, 2008, when he hit a tractor-trailer after losing control of his 2009 Suzuki GSX-R1000 and crossing the centre line. Environment Canada showed winds gusting to more than 50km/h (31mph) in the area {{at the time of}} the accident. The RCMP stated that Bourdon's inexperience with motorcycles may have been a factor in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, <b>instantly</b> available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships <b>instantly</b> {{recognisable}} to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|He {{had managed}} to retain some of his {{previous}} advisers, despite attempts by the Ordainers to remove them, and divided the extensive de Clare inheritance among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and Roger Damory, <b>instantly</b> making them extremely rich. Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.|$|E
5|$|In 1141 in Prague, crusader Christof Romuald is {{wounded in}} battle. He recovers in a church, {{where he is}} cared for by a nun called Anezka. The pair <b>instantly</b> fall in love but are {{restrained}} by their commitments to God. Christof enters a nearby silver mine to kill a monstrous Tzimisce vampire who is tormenting the city. Christof's victory is noted by the local vampires, one of whom, Ecaterina the Wise, turns him into a vampire to prevent another clan from taking him.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, at a {{competition}} in Massachusetts, Davidson's horse suffered a fall in a freak accident. The horse, High Scope, broke {{his neck and}} died <b>instantly,</b> while Davidson {{was taken to the}} intensive care unit at Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. After being treated for injuries, Davidson was released. In 2010, Davidson missed that year's Rolex Three Day Event in Kentucky after undergoing surgery to repair herniated discs in his back.|$|E
5|$|In Tactics Advance, turn-based {{tactical}} battles {{take place}} on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions <b>instantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his ship}} still docked in the harbor, Doran's son Trystane is {{painting}} stones for Myrcella's funeral. Obara and Nymeria Sand board his ship and enter his cabin, stating their intent to kill him. Despite proclaiming {{that he does}} not want to fight his family, he attempts to defend himself from Nymeria but is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara, killing him <b>instantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), computer-aided leak detection, and other features. The pipeline {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be <b>instantly</b> detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of 9 July 1917, Vanguards {{magazines}} exploded and she sank almost <b>instantly,</b> with only three survivors, one of whom died soon afterwards; 842 men aboard were lost. Collingwoods crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. The Board of Inquiry concluded that a fire of unknown origin began in a 4-inch magazine and spread to {{one or both of}} the nearby 12-inch magazines, which detonated and sank the ship.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Robbie Jones) {{is one of}} the Hellcats' {{bases and}} is an easy-going guy who has a love for action. He was once a star on the Lancer {{football}} team but quit when he discovered a scandal of players being paid by the college. He tried out for the Hellcats team when his then-girlfriend Alice encouraged him to do so in order to gain scholarship money after the football scandal, and <b>instantly</b> became hooked. He has an instant attraction to Marti. They later start dating.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine. She had to pay no war indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew <b>instantly</b> from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{is waiting}} {{in a hotel}} bar for his {{replacement}} Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to show up. While waiting, he meets {{a man at the}} bar and the two <b>instantly</b> hit it off. When Michael calls Vickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually Deangelo, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this.|$|E
5|$|Moments {{after the}} two planes collided, the only mayday {{distress}} call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30a.m. plus 20 seconds. The crippled airlinernow missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wingtrailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, and crashed into a then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden {{in what is now}} the unincorporated town of Enterprise. The nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion <b>instantly</b> killed everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|Moore was President of the British Astronomical Association, {{co-founder and}} {{president}} of the Society for Popular Astronomy (SPA), author of over seventy books on astronomy, and presenter of the world's longest-running television series with the same original presenter, the BBC's The Sky at Night. As an amateur astronomer, he became known as a specialist in Moon observation and for creating the Caldwell catalogue. Idiosyncrasies such as his rapid diction and monocle made him a popular and <b>instantly</b> recognisable figure on British television.|$|E
5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak {{character}} with very strong special attacks. His prayer attack {{is the most}} damaging in the game as it causes high damage, stuns <b>instantly</b> and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
