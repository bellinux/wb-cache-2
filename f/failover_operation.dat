50|$|Tibero RDBMS {{enables a}} stable and {{efficient}} management of DBMSs and guarantees high-performance transaction processing, using the Tibero Active Cluster (hereafter TAC) technology, which is a <b>failover</b> <b>operation</b> based on a shared disk clustering system environment. TAC allows instances on different nodes to share the same data via the shared disk. It supports stable system operation (24x365) with the fail-over function, and optimal transaction processing by guaranteeing the integrity of data in each instanceâ€™s memory.|$|E
5000|$|... 1+1 {{redundancy}} typically {{offers the}} advantage of additional failover transparency {{in the event of}} component failure. The level of resilience is referred to as active/active or hot as backup components actively participate with the system during normal <b>operation.</b> <b>Failover</b> is generally transparent (disruption to system availability) as failover does not actually occur (just degradation to system resilience) as the backup components were already active within the system.|$|R
