40|$|Due to high {{competition}} {{on the market}} the industry aims at increasing the efficiency in their assembly production line. The production cycle time is determined by many factors such as operation time at each production step, {{the reliability of the}} tool and so forth. Many of the assembly applications are performed with <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> which mean that a person, called operator, is holding the tool. Hence, physical stress is acting on the operator during tightening procedures and is therefore an important issue. As a result, development of better power tools is always needed. The goal with this thesis work is to build a simulation model of a hand held assembly tool. The simulation is to be use for development and evaluation of the present computer controlled tightening strategies. The model includes control unit, tool, joint and operator. Based on the model the aim is also the exploit the possibilities to improve the tightening algorithms in an automatic control fashion.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to hand transmitted vibration (HTV) {{arises from the}} <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>powered</b> <b>tools</b> extensively used in the mining and construction industry such as rock drills, chipping hammers, chain saws etc. Regular {{exposure to}} HTV is the major cause {{of a range of}} permanent injuries to human hands and arms which are commonly referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). In addition to this, the percussive tools generate overall sound power levels in excess of 110 dBA in most cases. Such a high sound power level greatly exceeds the maximum permissible exposure limit (PEL) of organizations such as National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Long term occupational exposure to this noise has been diagnosed as the main reason for permanent hearing loss in the operators. It is therefore important to develop an understanding of the mechanisms which lead to these high vibration and sound levels and in order to do this a detailed computational model of a pneumatic chipping hammer has been made. This paper presents a nonlinear computational model of a pneumatic chipping hammer. In order to better understand the dynamics of the chipping hammer, the hammer was subdivided into components that are shown in figure 1 (a) (based on a chipping hammer manufactured by Atlas-Copco). The hammer mainly consisted of a center body, a moving piston and a chisel. Compressed air is used to drive the piston inside of a cylinder and on the downward stroke this piston impacts the chisel to create the hammer effect. The machine has one pneumatic valve and this valve regulates the air supply either to the upper chamber or to the lower chamber. The valve changes according to the relative pressures in the two chambers and the supply pressure. There are also twelve different exhaust ports at two positions along the cylinder labeled upper ports and lower ports. As the piston moves the ports can be closed or open (allowing exhaust). Fundamentally, the computational model was made up of two different sub-models, a fluid model and a structural dynamic model as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b) respectively. The first sub-model takes into consideration the fluid dynamics of the machine since the hammer is driven by compressed air. Equations for the mass flow rate though bleed orifices (assuming an isentropic process) 1 is used to determine the mass flow {{into and out of the}} upper and lower chambers. From this the pressures in the two chambers and consequently the forcing on the piston can be calculated. The second sub-model deals with modeling the structural [...|$|R

40|$|The OPERC HAVTEC {{database}} of hand-transmitted vibration exposure contains measurements {{for a wide}} range of <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> (tested to ISO 5349). This paper examines measured vibration exposure levels of four electrical hammer drills, which were tested with a given range of drill-bit sizes from six drill-bit manufacturers. The measurements examined in this paper are taken from the OPERC HAVTEC database. Vibration exposure levels and time taken to drill a 100 mm deep hole were measured for each combination of drill and bit. The resulting measurements were analysed in accordance with ISO 5349 and the EU Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive. In addition to r. m. s. worst-hand root-sum-of-squares calculations, the number of 100 mm deep holes that may be drilled before reaching the Exposure Action Value (EAV) was also calculated. It was found that in many cases, although the measured vibration magnitudes showed no (or small) differences between the drill bits, the time to drill a 100 mm hole was affected by bit type. Therefore, the number of holes which an operator could drill before reaching the EAV was affected by bit type. These results demonstrate the importance of measuring tool efficiency in addition to vibration magnitude when performing a risk assessment. 1...|$|E
40|$|High speed {{twist drills}} are {{probably}} the most common of all metal cutting tools and also the least efficient. In this study, detailed research was undertaken into aspects of drill performance and ways in which drilling could be improved in short hole depths of up to two diameters. The work included an evaluation of twist drill geometry and grinding parameters. It was established that errors in point grinding lead to increased hole oversize and reduced drill life. A fundamental analysis was made to establish predictive equations for the drill torque and thrust using modified orthogonal cutting equations and empirical data. A good correlation was obtained between actual and predicted results. Two new techniques for extending twist drill life by the use of coolant feeding holes and also the application of titanium nitride coatings were evaluated. Both methods were found to have potential for improving drill performance. A completely new design of carbide tipped drill was designed and developed. The new design was tested and it compared favourably with two commercially available carbide tipped drills. In further work an entirely different type of drill point geometry was developed for the drill screw.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effects of}} {{vibration}} {{has been known}} for many years which causes illness to operators using the vibrating tools or <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>power</b> <b>tools.</b> Muscle weakness, particularly affecting the long finger flexors and affecting grip strength, may occur in association with long-term vibration exposure from hand-held tools. In order to quantify and assess safe levels of human exposure to vibration, empirical measurements and analysis of vibrations are therefore necessary. The aim of the study is to identify the effect of hand held vibrating tools on muscle activity and grip strength. The study was conducted on seven subjects (three male and four female). The experiments were performed with two kinds of exposure time, 5 and 15 minutes. Subjects were required to drill wood material using electric drill. Electromyography (EMG) and Vernier Labpro with 3 axis accelerometer used in the experiment. The results showed that mean vibration level for electric drill was 10. 53 m/s 2 for 15 minutes and 10. 39 m/s 2 for 5 minutes duration. The most affected muscle by vibration factor was found to be the extensor Carpi radials muscle. Extensor Carpi radials is one of the muscle at the forearm. The results in the study indicated that right extensor carpi radialis muscle was recorded the maximum % MVC (27. 66 %) compared to others muscle for all condition.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This is a copyright-cleared version of the Thesis. Despite challenges with poor emissions and fuel economy, gasoline two stroke engines continue to be developed {{for a number of}} applications. The primary reasons for the choice of a gasoline two stroke engine includes its low cost, mechanical simplicity and high specific power output. Some applications for the gasoline two stroke engine include small capacity motorcycles and scooters, off road recreational vehicles, <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> and unmanned aerial vehicles. New technologies, which are already mature in four stroke engines, are now being applied to two stroke engines. Such technologies include direct fuel injection, electronic engine management and exhaust gas after treatment. To implement these new technologies computation models are being continuously developed to improve the design process of engines. Multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling is now commonly applied to engine research and development, it is a powerful tool that can give great insight into the thermofluid working of an engine. Multi-dimensional tools are however computationally expensive and quasi-dimensional modelling methods are often better suited for the analysis of an engine, for example in transient engine simulation. This thesis reports {{the development of a new}} quasi-dimensional combustion model for a loop scavenged two stroke engine. The model differs from other quasi-dimensional models available in the literature as it accounts for a bulk motion of the flame front due to the tumble motion created by the loop scavenge process. In this study the tumble motion is modelled as an ellipsoid vortex and the size of the vortex is defined by the combustion chamber height and a limiting elliptical aspect ratio. The limiting aspect ratio has been observed in experimental square piston compression machines and optical engines. The new model also accounts for a wrinkled flame brush thickness and its effects on the interaction between flame front and combustion chamber. The new combustion model has been validated against experimental engine tests in which the flame front propagation was measured using ionization probes. The probes were able determine the flame front shape, the bulk movement of the flame front due to tumble and also the wrinkled flame brush thickness...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a Master Thesis in Industrial Design Engineering performed by two students at Luleå University of Technology, and it comprises 30 credits {{over a period}} of 20 weeks during the spring of 2015. The thesis describes a development project of a roof solution to a new railroad based logistics system called Turn Dumper, developed by Kiruna Wagon. The Turn Dumper wagon requires a cover since it has a closed bottom and no drains, and it is thus important to protect the bulk material from precipitation and prevent it from dusting out. The main premise for the cover is that it must be adapted to the Turn Dumper unloading station and wagon as well as enable loading with both wheel loader and silo. Further {{it is important that the}} opening and closing process of the cover can be performed in a safe manner with respect to the system as well as the user. To ensure that freight transport by the Turn Dumper system can be performed safely, the roof solution should have a locking mechanism to keep it closed. The process used in this project is a customised version of Kiruna Wagon’s own routine for product development. In addition to this routine, Kiruna Wagon has implied Lean Product Development in their work process and therefore Lean has been a basis for this thesis as well. The process this project has followed is divided into five steps; planning, literature review, feasibility study, creativity and realisation respectively final product development. During the feasibility study were, amongst others, benchmarking and user studies used to find the needs for a roof solution to Turn Dumper and from these be able to state a requirement specification. In the creativity and realisation phase different creative methods were used to generate as many concepts as possible. Thereafter the concepts were evaluated and the number of concepts was reduced until only one concept remained. This concept was detailed design in the final product development phase and the result for the Turn Dumper roof solution is a two-piece roof with a linkage system on the short ends of the wagon that is controlled by a hydraulic system. The linkage system consists of two four-bar linkages, each rotating one roof piece down along the long side of the loading body. The two linkages are connected by two rods and in their connecting point a hydraulic cylinder is mounted. The cylinder is pushed upward by the pressure created of a hydraulic pump, operated by a <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>powered</b> screwdriver. The weight of the linkage and hydraulic system is approximately 550 kilograms and the feasibility of the concept was shown by building a function model in scale 1. 10 and a proof of concept prototype in scale 1 : 20.
