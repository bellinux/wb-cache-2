50|$|The {{average person}} who {{purchases}} an automobile {{according to the}} International Armoring Corporation fits into {{at least one of}} the three categories. They have money, believe there is a genuine threat against their lives, or are a government official. Upon receiving a down payment by the client the <b>armoring</b> <b>process</b> begins. At the beginning of the process the company assigned with the project meets with the client. This meeting is to determine how the automobile should be customized to fit the client’s needs based on type of car, threat level, and defensive options. When determining type of car the customer has many options as any automobile can be armored. However, the weight of the armor can vary from 500 to 2000 pounds requiring special suspension and engines upgrades to be installed. After the car type is chosen the customer is asked about their perceived threat level. This helps the manufactures to determine what ballistic protection level the car needs customized for (See also, International Armoring Corporation). Ballistic protection levels range Type 1 to Type IV and are governed by National Institute of Justice Standard 0108.01. Once the preliminary review is completed and the specifications are finalized the manufacture begin the project.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Few {{distributed}} software-implemented {{fault tolerance}} (SIFT) environments have been experimentally evaluated using substantial applications {{to show that}} they protect both themselves and the applications from errors. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a SIFT environment used to oversee spaceborne applications as part of the Remote Exploration and Experimentation (REE) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The SIFT environment is built around a set of self-checking <b>ARMOR</b> <b>processes</b> running on different machines that provide error detection and recovery services to themselves and to the REE applications. An evaluation methodology is presented in which over 28, 000 errors were injected into both the SIFT processes and two representative REE applications. The experiments were split into three groups of error injections, with each group successively stressing the SIFT error detection and recovery more than the previous group. The results show that the SIFT environment added negligible overhead to the application’s execution time during failure-free runs. Correlated failures affecting a SIFT process and application process are possible, but the division of detection and recovery responsibilities in the SIFT environment allows it to recover from these multiple failure scenarios. Only 28 cases were observed in which either the application failed to start or the SIFT environment failed to recognize that the application had completed. Further investigations showed that assertions within the SIFT processes—coupled with object-based incremental checkpointing—were effective in preventing system failures by protecting dynamic data within the SIFT processes.

"Man who overlooks the water under bridge will find the bridge underwater. " This anonymous quotation highlights the detrimental effects that river flow can have on the stability of piers and abutments that support a bridge founded in river-beds. Scour is the engineering term for the erosion caused by water around bridge elements such as pier, monopile or abutments. Scour holes around a monopile can jeopardize the stability of the whole structure and will require deeper <b>piling</b> or local <b>armoring</b> of the river-bed. Both methods are relatively costly and therefore it is of great importance to predict the correct scour development for the given scenario. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to analyze the local scour phenomena and predict the scour hole shape and size around a pier. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to develop and implement a three-dimensional iterative procedure in order to predict the scour hole around the pier using the mesh morphing capabilities in STARCCM+ commercial CFD code. A computational methodology has been developed with Python and Java Macro scripts and implemented using Bash script in a UNIX environment. An implicit unsteady transient approach was used to obtain the bed shear stresses. The mesh was iteratively deformed towards the equilibrium scour based on the excess shear stress above the critical shear stress (supercritical shear stress). The model solves the flow field using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, and standard k [...] epsilon turbulence model. The iterative process involves stretching (morphing) meshed domain, after every time step, away from the bottom where scouring flow parameters are supercritical, and remeshing the relevant computational domain after certain number of time steps when the morphed mesh may compromise the stability of the further simulation. The simulation model was validated by comparing results with limited experimental data available in literature...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the spall properties of aluminum-magnesium (Al-Mg) alloys. Aluminum alloy 5083 (Al 5083) {{was used as a}} model alloy for the work performed in this study. Al-Mg alloys represent a light-weight and corrosion resistant alloy system often used in armor plating. It is desirable to <b>process</b> <b>armor</b> plate material to yield a microstructure that provides maximum resistance to spall failure due to blast and projectile impacts. The blast and impact resistance has often been quantified based on the measurement of the spall strength and the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL). The spall properties of Al-Mg alloys were measured for four different microstructural states resultant from varying processing conditions. The four microstructures include: (a) textured grain structure from a rolled Al 5083 -H 116 plate, (b) sub-micron grain structure produced using equi-channel angular pressing (ECAP),(c) equiaxed grain structure, and (d) precipitation hardened microstucture from an Al- 9 wt. % Mg alloy. The overall results show that grain size is not the most dominant microstructural feature affecting spall strength in aluminum alloys, when the impact conditions are the same. Texture, especially if brittle inclusions align along the grains, appears to have the most dominant effect resulting in decreased spall strength. Furthermore, one-dimensional modeling shows that the inclusion size and distribution is the controlling factor for void formation during spalling. Grain size does affect the decompression rate dependence of each microstructure, whereby smaller grain sizes result in a larger power law exponent for fits of spall strength versus decompression rate. Unlike the spall strength, the HEL shows an increasing trend with decreased grain size, as would be expected from a Hall-Petch type effect, indicating that a smaller grain size is best for penetration resistance. Samples processed using ECAP alone provide the best combination of spall strength and HEL and therefore the most promise for improved blast and penetration resistance of aluminum-magnesium alloy armor plates.

40|$|Discussions {{related to}} the adverse impacts {{associated}} with shore armor (i. e. seawalls and riprap) are a common topic within the coastal community. While many agree that the installation of these structures alters the shores geomorphic response, there is disagreement in the type and degree of response. Furthermore, studies that have delved into this topic have been conducted in numerous settings but have been confounded {{by a lack of}} data regarding shore morphologies prior to installation of these structures. At Yellowstone National Park, there is an opportunity to assess the impacts of shore armor quantitatively because the National Park Service requires detailed surveys in advance of all infrastructure improvement projects in an effort to determine the overall impacts of these projects on park environments relative to their benefits to park visitors and employees. The purpose of this study then was to contribute to this ongoing discussion of adverse impacts from shore armor by monitoring several non-engineered and engineered shore segments along the shore of Yellowstone Lake. For the purposes of this study, all shore segments that possessed shore armor (i. e. a seawall or riprap) were referred to as an engineered beach while any shore lacking a seawall or riprap was classified as a non-engineered shore segment. This study began with an effort to determine if there were geomorphic differences between several non-engineered and engineered shore segments located along the western and northern shore of Yellowstone Lake. This effort was accomplished by measuring cross-shore profiles, dry-beach widths and conducting a grain size analysis of the dry-beach sediments. Results from the initial survey conducted in July-August 2005 established that there were significant geomorphic differences between the non-engineered and engineered shore segments of Yellowstone Lake. Visual observations combined with surveyed cross-shore profiles, grain size analyses and dry-beach width measurements revealed that the non-engineered shore segments were indeed geomorphically different from the engineered segments. That is, the non-engineered shore segments displayed relatively wider beaches composed of sand to fine gravel with gently sloping profiles whereas the engineered shores were typified with angular L-shaped profiles with narrow dry-beach faces. In addition to the geomorphic differences, visual observations and analysis of the data revealed that the engineered shores were indeed adversely impacted by the shore <b>armor</b> through the <b>processes</b> of placement loss and profile deflation. A repeat survey was then conducted in the summers of 2006 and 2007 to determine the short-term variability of these non-engineered and engineered shore segments. Three years of data with a two-year interval indicated that there was a consistent difference in the geomorphology of the non-engineered and engineered shore segments. These differences were reflected in the cross-shore profile, the volume, and the dry beach width for all four study sites. In addition to these consistent differences, analysis of the data showed that the non-engineered shore cross-shore profiles fluctuated about a mean shape, whereas the volumetric calculations and dry-beach measurements showed that both the non-engineered and engineered shores experience annual variability in their shore morphologies. Insight into the short-term variability was an essential component for the third portion of the study, which was an investigation into the long-term response of the shore to the engineering efforts along the shore of Yellowstone Lake. The third and final phase of this research was a long-term study of the shore responses to shore armor at Yellowstone Lake. This aspect of the study was intriguing because very few long-term studies focused specifically on shore responses to shore engineering exist. The methodology of this study incorporated the use of Historical GIS techniques to extract quantifiable data from construction drawings in order to be compared with the contemporary data collected from 2005 to 2007. Results revealed that, while both the non-engineered and engineered shore segments experienced a decrease in volume, the volumetric decrease was more pronounced for the non-engineered shores. The engineered shores indicated a smaller amount of volumetric change, suggesting that passive erosional processes and placement loss has had a long-term impact on the engineered shores in that the engineered structures have fixed the shoreline at these segments while the non-engineered shores are still able to adjust to changing conditions. Upon completion of this dissertation research, it was concluded that the engineered shore segments of Yellowstone Lake exhibit morphological features similar to those associated with hard stabilization of marine and Great Lakes coastal settings and are suggestive of enhanced erosion and shore degradation at engineered shore sites when compared to adjacent non-engineered shore segments. Ongoing monitoring and repeat annual surveys of study sites enhance understanding of shore zone processes at Yellowstone Lake. Furthermore, results from this study may also aid in developing alternative strategies for protecting lakeside infrastructure {{while at the same time}} conserving lakeshore resources and preserving the quality of visitor experiences at Yellowstone Lake...|$|R
