50|$|In Fig. 2 {{the general}} {{design of a}} vector (a <b>genetic</b> <b>vehicle</b> to {{transform}} a yeast strain into a genetically engineered protein producer). It must contain several genetic elements:1. A selection marker, required to select a transformed strain from an untransformed background -this can be done if for instance such an element enables a deficient strain to grow under culturing conditions void of a certain compound like a particular amino acid that cannot be produced by the deficient strain).2. Certain elements to propagate and to target the foreign DNA to the chromosome of the yeast (ARS and/or rDNA sequence).3. A segment responsible {{for the production of}} the desired protein compound a so-called expression cassette. Such a cassette is made up by a sequence of regulatory elements, a promoter that controls, how much and under which circumstances a following gene sequence is transcribed and as a consequence how much protein is eventually made. This means that the segment following the promoter is variable depending on the desired product - it could be a sequence determining the amino acids for insulin, for hepatitis B vaccine or for interferon. The expression cassette is terminated by a following terminator sequence that provides a proper stop of the transcription. The promoter elements of the O. polymorpha system are derived from genes that are highly expressed, from instance from the MOX gene, the FMD gene or the TPS1 gene mentioned before. They are not only very strong, but can also be regulated by certain addition of carbon sources like sugar, methanol or glycerol. In 2000 an informal society of scientists was founded named HPWN (Hansenula polymorpha worldwide network) founded by Prof. Marten Veenhuis, Groningen, and Prof, Dr. Gerd Gellissen, Düsseldorf.

40|$|Cells remarkably take a {{specific}} differentiation path among the multiple possibilities that can arise through the multi-dimensional regulation of genome activities. Such deterministic processes suggest {{the existence of}} cellular attractors. However, the origins and drivers of the attractors still remain elusive.

40|$|Common regions” (CRs), such as Orf 513, {{are being}} {{increasingly}} linked to mega-antibiotic-resistant regions. While their overall nucleotide sequences show little identity to other mobile elements, amino acid alignments {{indicate that they}} possess the key motifs of IS 91 -like elements, which {{have been linked to}} the mobility ent plasmids in pathogenic Escherichia coli. Further inspection reveals that they possess an IS 91 -like origin of replication and termination sites (terIS), and therefore CRs probably transpose via a rolling-circle replication mechanism. Accordingly, in this review we have renamed CRs as ISCRs to give a more accurate reflection of their functional properties. The genetic context surrounding ISCRs indicates that they can procure 5 ′ sequences via misreading of the cognate terIS, i. e., “unchecked transposition. ” Clinically, the most worrying aspect of ISCRs is that they are increasingly being linked with more potent examples of resistance, i. e., metallo-β-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and co-trimoxazole resistance in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Furthermore, if ISCR elements do move via “unchecked RC transposition,” as has been speculated for ISCR 1, then this mechanism provides antibiotic resistance genes with a highly mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>vehicle</b> that could greatly exceed the effects of previously reported mobile genetic mechanisms. It has been hypothesized that bacteria will surprise us by extending their “genetic construction kit” to procure and evince additional DNA and, therefore, antibiotic resistance genes.

40|$|Abstract Background The transposon-based gene {{delivery}} technique {{is emerging as}} a method of choice for gene therapy. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) system {{has become one of the}} most favored methods, because of its efficiency and its random integration profile. Copy-number determination of the delivered transgene is a crucial task, but a universal method for measuring this is lacking. In this paper, we show that a real-time quantitative PCR-based, transgene-independent (qPCR-TI) method is able to determine SB transposon copy numbers regardless of the genetic cargo. Results We designed a specific PCR assay to amplify the left inverted repeat-direct repeat region of SB, and used it together with the single-copy control gene RPPH 1 and a reference genomic DNA of known copy number. The qPCR-TI method allowed rapid and accurate determination of SB transposon copy numbers in various cell types, including human embryonic stem cells. We also found that this sensitive, rapid, highly reproducible and non-radioactive method is just as accurate and reliable as the widely used blotting techniques or the transposon display method. Because the assay is specific for the inverted repeat region of the transposon, it could be used in any system where the SB transposon is the <b>genetic</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Conclusions We have developed a transgene-independent method to determine copy numbers of transgenes delivered by the SB transposon system. The technique is based on a quantitative real-time PCR detection method, offering a sensitive, non-radioactive, rapid and accurate approach, which has a potential to be used for gene therapy. </p...|$|E

Antimicrobial agents represent one major therapeutic tools implicated to treat these infections. The misuse of antimicrobial agents has resulted in the emergence of resistant strains of Gram-negatives in particular Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters; they have an effect not only on a human but on the public health when bacteria use the resistance mechanisms to spread in the hospital environment and to the community outside the hospitals by means of mobile genetic elements.

40|$|Antibiotics have natural functions, mostly {{involving}} cell-to-cell signaling networks. The anthropogenic {{production of}} antibiotics, and its release in the microbiosphere {{results in a}} disturbance of these networks, antibiotic resistance tending to preserve its integrity. The cost of such adaptation is the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes, and of all <b>genetic</b> and cellular <b>vehicles</b> in which these genes are located. Selection of the combinations of the different evolutionary units (genes, integrons, transposons, plasmids, cells, communities and microbiomes, hosts) is highly asymmetrical. Each unit of selection is a self-interested entity, exploiting the higher hierarchical unit for its own benefit, but in doing so the higher hierarchical unit might acquire critical traits for its spread because of the exploitation of the lower hierarchical unit. This interactive trade-off shapes the population biology of antibiotic resistance, a composed-complex array of the independent "population biologies. " Antibiotics modify the abundance and the interactive field {{of each of these}} units. Antibiotics increase the number and evolvability of "clinical" antibiotic resistance genes, but probably also many other genes with different primary functions but with a resistance phenotype present in the environmental resistome. Antibiotics influence the abundance, modularity, and spread of integrons, transposons, and plasmids, mostly acting on structures present before the antibiotic era. Antibiotics enrich particular bacterial lineages and clones and contribute to local clonalization processes.

40|$|Autophagy is a {{cellular}} process that delivers cytoplasmic materials for degradation by the lysosomes. Autophagy-related (Atg) genes {{were identified in}} yeast <b>genetic</b> screens for <b>vehicle</b> formation under stress conditions, and Atg genes are conserved from yeast to human. When cells or animals are under stress, autophagy is induced and Atg 8 (LC 3 in mammal) is activated by E 1 activating enzyme Atg 7. Atg 8 -containing membranes form and surround cargos, close and mature to become the autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and cargos are degraded by lysosomal enzymes to sustain cell viability. Therefore, autophagy is most frequently considered to function in cell survival. Whether the Atg gene regulatory pathway that was defined in yeast is utilized for all autophagy in animals, as well as if autophagy could function in a cell death scenario, are less understood. The Drosophila larval digestive tissues, such as the midgut of the intestine and the salivary gland, are no longer required for the adult animal and are degraded during the pupal stage of development. Cells stop growing {{at the end of}} larval development, and proper cell growth arrest is required for midgut degradation. Ectopic activation of the PI 3 K/Akt signaling induces cell growth and inhibits autophagy and midgut degradation. Down regulating PI 3 K/Akt pathway by Pten mis-expression activates autophagy. In addition, mis-expression of autophagy initiator Atg 1 inhibits cell growth and knocking down autophagy restore PI 3 K/Akt activity. Together, these results indicate that autophagy and growth signaling mutually inhibit each other. Midgut destruction relies on the autophagy gene Atg 18, but not caspase activation. The intestine length shortens and the cells undergo programmed cell size reduction, a phenomenon that also requires Atg 18, before cell death occurs during midgut destruction. To further investigate whether cell size reduction is cell autonomous and requires other Atg genes, we reduced the function of Atg genes in cell clones using either gene mutations or RNAi knockdowns. Indeed, many Atg genes, including Atg 8, are required for autophagy and cell size reduction in a cell autonomous manner. Surprisingly, Atg 7 is not required for midgut cell size reduction and autophagy even though this gene is essential for stress-induced autophagy. Therefore, we screened for known E 1 enzymes that may function in the midgut, and discovered that Uba 1 is required for autophagy, size reduction and clearance of mitochondria. Uba 1 does not enzymatically substitute for Atg 7, and Ubiquitin phenocopies Uba 1, suggesting Uba 1 functions through ubiquitination of unidentified molecule(s) to regulate autophagy. In conclusion, this thesis describes: First, autophagy participates in midgut degradation and cell death. Second it reveals a previously un-defined role of Uba 1 in autophagy regulation. Third it shows that the Atg genes are not functionally conserved and the requirement of some Atg genes can be context dependent...|$|R
40|$|In a 6 month {{research}} at Kyoto University and Delft University of Technology, the urban distribution centre (UDC) was investigated with a multi-agent model to find {{situations where the}} UDC can be financial viable. From a literature study the main modeling components were found: commodity estimation, vehicle routing, traffic environment, agent interaction and various policy measurements. Policies to test {{the impact on the}} business case of the UDC are: different congestion and toll rates, subsidy and a dynamic fee. Hereby a gap in literature is addressed by dynamic modeling with a multi-agent model with vehicle routing and incorporating dynamic usage. Dynamics are included with variable traffic conditions (resulting in dynamic travel times) and dynamic demand locations. Dynamic UDC usage was tested by various delivery schemes and a dynamic fee, which changes hourly. After generating the multi-agent model with a <b>genetic</b> algorithm for <b>vehicle</b> routing, it has to be checked that an increasing UDC usage rate corresponds to decreasing both the NOx emission and km count (NOx emission reduction of 19. 0 % ± 13. 7 % and km count reduction of 18. 8 % ± 12. 9 % over 2318 runs). The model tested different UDC delivery schemes (early delivery, fixed time delivery or full truck delivery), congestion rates (low, normal or high), toll rates (none, low or high) and subsidy levels (none, 25 %, 33 % or 50 % subsidized). The only positive business case for the UDC is with a subsidy rate of 50 % (rate 4), which shows the complexity of generating a positive business case for an UDC. Per setting 360 runs were performed. To enhace the UDC financial performance the dynamic UDC fee was tested. This fee varies during the different hours of the day. Five cases were tested by increasing the general dynamic fee curve with an additional global shift of - 20, - 10, 0, 10 or 20 Yen per parcel. The impact of NOx emission or km count reduction correcsponds to the fixed fee scenario. Per setting 50 runs were performed. Significant differences between various dynamic fee settings are present. The fact that the UDC income is close to being significantly higher than the - 300. 000 Yen per day, compared to similar fixed fee conditions is highly encouraging. However further and full evaluation of all possible dynamic fee settings is desired to find potential better dynamic fee settings than the currently used settings. At the end of this research three cases are compared for dynamic fee usage: a reference case, highly congested city case and the involved municipality case. Comparing the three scenarios, there is {{no significant difference between the}} NOx emission or km count reduction and the freight carriers costs. For the UDC income there is a significant income increase in the third scenario with respect to the other scenarios. Also for the municipality there is a significant increase in costs in the third scenario. Since there is no significant decrease in NOx emission or km count between the second and third scenario, the municipality will need other social or financial incentives, before the municipality will participate in providing such high and long term subsidies. From this research it is clear that generating a positive business for a UDC is highly challenging. For a UDC to be profitable, it seems to be necessary to receive subsidy permanently. This analysis of the UDC analysis relates to the low UDC success rate of the research of Browne, Sweet et al (2005). The conditions for generating a successful business case for the UDC are hard and limited. Further research of dynamic fee settings and investigation of the possibility to implement this in a real-life case can contribute to future prospective and the success rate for urban distribution centres.
