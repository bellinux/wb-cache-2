40|$|Outsourcing <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> {{tasks in}} product {{development}} is increasingly popular. However, firms that outsource <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> tasks often experience problems. So far, no satisfactory answer exists regarding {{the question to}} what extent <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> tasks can be outsourced before negative consequences occur. We address this gap. This paper identifies the limits of <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> outsourcing in product development, and the sources of these limits. To do so, it investigates the organizational challenges that a major European automotive manufacturer faced when it decided to adopt an extreme form of <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> outsourcing. Based on an in-depth case study, we identify the sources of problems with outsourcing <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> tasks in product development, and {{shed light on the}} limits of <b>design</b> and <b>engineering</b> outsourcing in product development...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{contains}} {{the papers in}} the design area from the Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in <b>Engineering.</b> <b>Design</b> is that most fundamental but least understood of engineering activities. Most current computer-aided design systems are primarily concerned with graphical representations of objects as they are being designed. The introduction of artificial intelligence into engineering has fostered the burgeoning interest in formal methods of <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> These methods treat design as being modelable using reasoning processes. The papers related to design can be grouped into two categories: those primarily concerned with design knowledge in its various forms and those primarily concerned with applications in specific domains. The papers in this volume are presented under the following headings: Design Knowledge and Representation, Integrated Circuit <b>Design,</b> Mechanical <b>Engineering</b> <b>Design,</b> Structural <b>Engineering</b> <b>Design,</b> Simultaneous <b>Engineering</b> <b>Design,</b> Architectural Desig...|$|R

40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{study examined the}} current status of technology education teacher practices with respect to <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Participants were drawn from the current International Technology Education Association (ITEA) high school teacher membership database. A survey instrument gathered data {{about the extent to which}} <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> concepts are incorporated into the curriculum content, and assessment practices employed by secondary technology educators. Moreover, the survey identified challenges faced by technology educators when seeking to implement <b>engineering</b> <b>design.</b> Current curriculum content that addresses <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> concepts consisted of the following seven subsets: (a) <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> (b) <b>engineering</b> analysis, (c) application of <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> (d) <b>engineering</b> communication, (e) <b>design</b> thinking, (f) <b>engineering</b> and human values, and (g) engineering science. The instrument was developed from current research in technology education that has identified curricular goals, content recommended for teaching an <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> focused program at the high school level, appropriate assessment practices for evaluating <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> projects, and perceived challenges facing teachers implementing <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> content (Asunda 2 ̆ 6 Hill, 2007; Rhodes 2 ̆ 6 Childress, 2006; Smith, 2006; Gattie 2 ̆ 6 Wicklein, 2007). A composite score of total instructional hours was generated for each of the seven <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> categories by combining the mean scores of frequency of use and time per typical use. These composite score results revealed that the categories <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> design thinking related to <b>engineering</b> <b>design,</b> and <b>engineering</b> communications were greatly emphasized in secondary technology education programs. The study results also indicated that engineering and human values, engineering science, and engineering analysis were the least emphasized categories in technology education curriculum content. The results of technology education teacher practices revealed that little emphasis has been place on assessing mathematical models to predict design results...|$|R
