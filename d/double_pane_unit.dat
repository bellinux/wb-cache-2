40|$|Insulating glass (IG) is {{comprised}} of two plates of glass that lie close to one another without touching. The plates are separated by a sealed gas space that consists of a spacer material that surrounds the perimeter of each plate. This spacer does not allow gas flow into {{or out of the}} IG unit. IG must consist of at least two plates of glass, but can be expanded to three plates of glass where there would be two sealed gas spaces. As a result of the configuration of IG units, the load that is distributed between the plates will vary based on the properties of the glass, the initial conditions of the unit, and the properties of the spacer material. It has long been understood that the load sharing between <b>double</b> <b>pane</b> IG <b>units</b> can be influenced by different factors in the unit. These factors include the thickness of the plates, temperature variations in the sealed gas space, and atmospheric pressure differences between the sealed gas space and the current atmospheric pressure. Computer software was used to write a program that accurately modeled existing experimental data on tests completed for <b>double</b> <b>pane</b> IG <b>units.</b> When accurate results were obtained, a portion of the research was used to focus on flexibility in the spacer material transferring a portion of the load through the <b>unit.</b> A triple <b>pane</b> IG model was developed to evaluate the effects of extreme pressure drops in a hurricane as well as gas space temperature variations. Spacer flexibility was incorporated into this model to see its influence on load sharing between the plates of glass.

In many buildings large amount of glazed area are used and the thermal properties of the glazed area are very important for the definitions of energy loads. Specifically the U-value and solar heat gain coefficient are needed to calculate the energy performance of buildings using dynamic computer simulations. In this paper we have focused on winter losses. In this field two different EN standards can help for the determination of the Uvalue: standard calculation considering conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer (EN 673) or measurement by means of a double hot plate (EN 674).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or <b>double</b> <b>pane</b> glazing with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated <b>double</b> <b>pane</b> glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively.

50|$|Window frost (also called fern frost or ice flowers) forms when a {{glass pane}} {{is exposed to}} very cold air {{on the outside and}} warmer, {{moderately}} moist air on the inside. If the pane is not a good insulator (for example, if it is a single pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear {{on the bottom of the}} window even with <b>double</b> <b>pane</b> energy efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles the frost will usually form on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences the shape of crystals, so imperfections, scratches, or dust can modify the way ice nucleates. The patterns in window frost form a fractal with a fractal dimension greater than one but less than two. This is a consequence of the nucleation process being constrained to unfold in two dimensions, unlike a snowflake which is shaped by a similar process but forms in three dimensions and has a fractal dimension greater than two.|$|R

Then, the paper describes the development of a glazing system designed for the retrofitting of an educational building.

The analysis of the tradeoff between the goals of guaranteeing sufficient daylighting, clear perception of the external environment, and energy saving helps finalizing the design of the new monolithic aerogel glazing system...|$|R

Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the glass window is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a glass window for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 glass windows with film are investigated in this study.
