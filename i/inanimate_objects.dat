5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects.</b> Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. <b>Inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E
5|$|Another {{series of}} Chera coins depicts various animals along with symbols on its obverse and the Chera emblem on its reverse. Elephant, horse, bull, {{tortoise}} and lion are the animals depicted in this series, along with snake and fish. Symbols of <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, swastika, trident, flowers and the sun.|$|E

Although these games may be played without a light gun, the use of more conventional input methods has been deemed inferior. Light gun shooters typically feature generic action or horror themes, though some later games employ more humorous, self-referential styles.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine. While they find the device works with <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects,</b> the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E
5|$|In America, Angier meets {{scientist}} Nikola Tesla {{and asks}} him to build him the machine Tesla built for Borden. While waiting for Tesla to finish, Angier deciphers Borden's diary, which he discovers to be fraudulent: Borden confesses that Tesla {{has nothing to}} do with Borden's trick and that Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary to send him away. Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> a distance from the machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E

5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist {{may be required to}} defend himself by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects,</b> testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|The Pokémon {{franchise}} {{revolves around}} 805fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The {{designs for the}} multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything, such as <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects,</b> real-world animals, or mythology. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, {{only a handful of}} artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon, however, by 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Chola coins {{discovered}} {{so far are}} not as many as those of Pandyas; {{most of them have}} been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds chests colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} orbs of the corresponding color. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new, more powerful attacks—and replenishing the Rage meter, which, if full, {{allows for the}} usage of the Rage of the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects.</b> The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests. The Eyes and Feathers increase {{the length of the}} Health and Magic Meters, respectively; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn, the player's power.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects</b> or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Most gods were {{depicted}} in several ways. Hathor {{could be a}} cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are {{depicted in}} {{a finite number of}} these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects.</b> Combinations of forms, such as gods with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{designs for}} Pokémon are often highly {{analogous}} to real-life creatures, but also encompass <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects.</b> Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno {{have stated that}} inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world {{provide the basis for}} countless ideas to be incorporated into the franchise. The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed. The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of Sun and Moon. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times they are designed around a particular type.|$|E
5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain <b>inanimate</b> <b>objects.</b> Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
