40|$|Graduation date: 1975 This study {{conducted}} at Fairview Hospital and Training Center, Salem, Oregon {{was part of}} a larger study by the Mental Health Division, Department of Human Resources, State of Oregon. The purpose was to determine a course of action to be followed by the Food Service Department to compensate for decreasing numbers of resident (patient) workers available to assist with work in the serving areas. The purpose of the thesis study was to compare and analyze worker utilization and productivity in two cottage serving areas, Martin and Patterson, using random sampling observations. The cottages were alike in all respects except the composition of the staff. Resident workers as well as regular employees were scheduled in Martin, but only regular employees in Patterson. A preliminary study, by continuous observation, was conducted in each area for one complete work day to determine how workers spent their time and the tasks involved. All tasks were grouped into three work classifications, direct work, <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> and delays, based on those used by Donaldson, University of Wisconsin. Results of how time was spent, 61 percent direct work, 6 percent <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> and 33 percent delays, provided estimates from which to calculate the minimum number of random observations required for the next part of the study. Data for the work sampling study were collected by trained observers over a two-week period. Total observational readings in each cottage varied because of the different number of persons working in each area. Findings showed: 1. Regular employees and resident workers working together spent 54. 18 percent of their time for direct work, 5. 76 percent for <b>indirect</b> <b>work,</b> and 46. 29 percent for delays. 2. Regular employees working alone spent 65. 26 percent of their time for direct work, 1. 99 percent for <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> and 32. 75 percent for delays. 3. The productivity rate, determined as the total of direct work and <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> time, was 67 percent for regular employees working alone, 54 percent for employees and resident workers working together (80 percent for employees and 44 percent for resident workers). 4. Time spent in direct work was spread fairly evenly throughout the day when resident workers were present. When employees worked alone, direct work time had pronounced peaks around meal periods. 5. The average labor time per meal served for employees and resident workers combined was 1 0. 46 minutes, for employees working alone, 4. 60 minutes. 6, Findings did not support the three hypotheses tested: that the total percent of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> combined will be the same with either staffing pattern; that direct work time will be greater without resident workers present, but there will be a corresponding difference in <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> activities relating to resident workers; and that delay time will be the same for both staffing patterns. 7. Statistical analyses showed the following: Chi square test indicated a significant difference (0. 01 level) in percent of time spent for direct work, <b>indirect</b> <b>work,</b> and delays between the two cottages; multiple correlation analysis showed significant correlation (0. 05 level) between age and experience of employees and <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> time; regression analysis showed age and experience accounted for 65 percent of the variables influencing <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> time. Based on the findings, the conclusion was that employees appeared to be more productive when resident workers were present than when employees worked alone. Employees probably worked at a slower speed to keep pace with the resident workers; thus activities took longer to complete. Recommendations from findings included: (1) staff in each cottage serving area be comprised of employees only; (2) resident workers should not be used as a source of labor, but those in the Food Service Training Program be given opportunity for experience in the serving areas; (3) two part-time employees, one from 6 : 00 am to 10 : 00 am and the second from 3 : 30 pm to 7 : 30 pm, be considered as optimal replacement for resident workers in each serving area. Other recommendations, for long-range planning were: staggered meal hours in the cottages to allow one full-time employee to work between two cottages; integration of staff in cottages to form a "cottage staff" and reduce departmentalization; and alternative methods of food delivery to cottages...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The extant {{literature}} suggests that poorly defined job roles {{make it difficult for}} peer support workers to be successful, and hinder their integration into multi-disciplinary workplace teams. This article uses data gathered as part of a participatory evaluation of a peer support program at a psychiatric tertiary care facility to specify the work that peers do. Methods Data were gathered through interviews, focus groups, and activity logs and were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Results Peers engage in direct work with clients and in <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> that supports their work with clients. The main types of direct work are advocacy, connecting to resources, experiential sharing, building community, relationship building, group facilitation, skill building/mentoring/goal setting, and socialization/self-esteem building. The main types of <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> are group planning and development, administration, team communication, supervision/training, receiving support, education/awareness building, and information gathering and verification. In addition, peers also do work aimed at building relationships with staff and work aimed at legitimizing the peer role. Experience, approach, presence, role modeling, collaboration, challenge, and compromise {{can be seen as the}} tangible enactments of peers’ philosophy of work. Conclusions Candidates for positions as peer support workers require more than experience with mental health and/or addiction problems. The job description provided in this article may not be appropriate for all settings, but it will contribute to a better understanding of the peer support worker position, the skills required, and the types of expectations that could define successful fulfillment of the role. </p...|$|E

Performance times, walking distances, layout space requirements were evaluated for 6 workstations using ‘big boxes’ of parts along the line. Biomechanical loading on spine and shoulder was estimated {{for one of the}} workstations. Comparisons were made to simulated layouts with the ‘narrow bin’ approach. The use of narrow bin supply yielded significant reductions in rack lengths (− 81 %), Material Areas (− 61 %), Walking Distances (− 61 %), <b>Indirect</b> <b>Work</b> (− 24 %), and Cycle times (− 8 %). Peak and cumulative spinal load estimates showed reductions from 29 % to 65 % with similar load reductions in shoulders and hands. The ‘narrow bin’ strategy also has implications for the material re-supply system, enables the use of flexible racking and can reduce lift-truck use. Work intensification may increase risks if time-gains are used only to increase direct assembly work repetitions. It is concluded that the narrow bin supply strategy has potential to both improve productivity and reduce risk characteristics of the system. Further field testing is required. Relevance to industry: Supplying materials in smaller narrower bins poses a potential ‘win-win’ design tactic with decreased operator risks and improved performance in final assembly when compared to ‘big box’ supply strategies.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Review of {{advances}} in the primary care research on low back pain (LBP) from a unique international forum, and analysis of open-ended questionnaires from participants. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LBP continues {{to be one of}} the most common and challenging problems in primary care. It is associated with enormous costs in terms of direct health care expenditures, and <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> and disability-related losses. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the current status and state of the art regarding LBP in primary care. METHODS: Four reviewers independently assessed the content and implications of presentations at the Fourth International Forum for Primary Care Research on LBP, pooled the data, and then augmented it with open-ended questionnaires completed by 35 participants. RESULTS: The Fourth Forum documented the field's emergent new paradigm-a transition from thinking about back pain as a biomedical "injury" to viewing LBP as a multifactorial biopsychosocial pain syndrome. The paradigm shift has occurred in the context of increased interest in evidence-based medicine regarding LBP in primary care. The Forum demonstrated the strides taken in moving from research and evidence gathering, through guidelines and policy formulations and finally to the dissemination and implementation imperative. There was an increasing confidence among the Forum researchers that LBP can be managed successfully in primary care settings through a combination of encouraging activity, reassurance, short-term symptom control, and alteration of inappropriate beliefs about the correlations of back pain with impairment and disability. There is also recognition that a wide range of international, evidence-based guidelines now exists that have very similar messages. CONCLUSIONS: The Fourth Forum reflected a major shift in the conceptualization of LBP in primary care and an increased emphasis on implementation and dissemination of LBP research findings and clinical guidelines. Although there is a wide array of challenges ahead, the Fourth Forum provided a clear message regarding the need to focus research energies on changing practitioner behavior...|$|E
40|$|Le concept des coûts indirects des {{accidents}} du travail a de tout temps intéressé les intervenants en santé et sécurité au travail. Les auteurs tracent son évolution depuis la première étude d'Heinrich en 1931 jusqu'à ce jour. Ils constatent une très grande hétérogénéité dans les résultats obtenus par les études répertoriées. Ces écarts peuvent s'expliquer par des dissemblances {{au niveau}} des définitions, des méthodologies de recherche utilisées et des populations visées. Sixty years ago Heinrich discovered that employers' costs of work accidents far exceeded the amounts typically attributed to such events. It therefore became accepted practice for occupational {{health and safety}} (OHS) specialists to add to known or «direct» costs, a multiple, representing hidden, invisible or «indirect» costs which are entirely absorbed by the firm. This approach contains an implicit behavioral assumption that employer awareness of his total accident costs will increase the perceived returns on prevention activities and consequently lead to greater investment in accident reduction expenditures. The present description and analysis of the literature traces the concept of indirect costs from its origins up to the current period. The first section deals with the evolution of the notion of indirect costs. Then the economic aspects are surveyed. Finally, the definitions, methodologies and results of the empirical studies are analyzed. Work accident cost research may be divided into two types: «primary» and «secondary». In the first, original cost data on individual accidents are collected using a questionnaire distributed to employers in one or more industrial sectors. The second type measures total accident costs by applying the information (ratios) generated in primary studies to other, available data on direct or known costs. RESULTS Many primary studies generated ratios (indirect costs/direct costs) to express the magnitude of accident costs. The size of the ratios found vary from 1 : 1 to 10 : 1 and more; the most common, that of Heinrich (1931), being 4 : 1. Other authors, observing no linear relationship between indirect and direct costs, have preferred different methodologies to express the importance of indirect costs (e. g. Simonds and Grimaldi, 1956). In addition, the most recent ratio studies suggest much more moderate results than those found previously. OBSERVATIONS 1. Very few primary empirical studies have been carried out, the vast majority being of the secondary type. Of those primary surveys reported many are deficient since they reveal precious little on the population studied, methodologies, frequency tables and the actual statistical analysis of the data. These are often found as a chapter in a textbook or handbook on the management of OHS and therefore represent more of an exploratory treatment of the indirect cost concept than a rigorous, scientific procedure of systematic data-gathering, reporting and analysis. The application of their results for estimating real costs must thus be treated with a certain degree of caution. 2. The indirect cost coefficients generally in use today by OHS practitioners and by authors of secondary studies are based on research dating from as far as 1931 (Heinrich) and 1955 (Simonds). The ensuing technical and organisational changes in the workplace have rendered such results largely obsolete. 3. There are substantial variations in the definitions of direct and indirect costs as well as other aspects of research methodologies, making comparisons of the results difficult. Standardization of these aspects would permit more useful comparative studies. 4. Many studies are based on very small populations of accidents or on limited intra- or inter-sectorial representativeness. Sector-specific coefficients generated from multi-sector data would permit more accurate estimates of the extent of indirect costs since these can be expected to vary with firm size, technology, victim characteristics, production standards and organization, etc. 5. No broadly-based, scientific study of <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> accident costs has ever been carried out in Canada. This is a serious weakness in our ability to estimate total accident costs particularly since relatively high Canadian incidence and severity rates warrant such an undertaking (see Brody, Rohan and Rompre, 1985).

This post-hoc analysis evaluates the relationships among cognition, psychopathology, and psychosocial functioning in patients with schizophrenia at baseline and following sustained treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Methods Data were obtained from a clinical trial assessing the cognitive effects of selected antipsychotic drugs in patients with schizophrenia. Patients were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of treatment with olanzapine (n = 159), risperidone (n = 158), or haloperidol (n = 97). Psychosocial functioning was assessed with the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale [QLS], cognition with a standard battery of neurocognitive tests; and psychiatric symptoms with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]. A path-analytic approach was used to evaluate the effects of changes in cognitive functioning on subdomains of quality of life, and to determine whether such effects were direct or mediated via changes in psychiatric symptoms. Results At baseline, processing speed affected functioning mainly indirectly via negative symptoms. Positive symptoms also affected functioning at baseline although independent of cognition. At 24 weeks, changes in processing speed affected changes in functioning both directly and indirectly via PANSS negative subscale scores. Positive symptoms no longer contributed to the path-analytic models. Although a consistent relationship was observed between processing speed and the 3 functional domains, variation existed as to whether the paths were direct and/or <b>indirect.</b> <b>Working</b> memory and verbal memory did not significantly contribute to any of the path-analytic models studied.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{remains one of}} the most common and {{challenging}} primary care issues in the developed world. Manual occupations such as nursing are known to involve a high risk of occupational LBP, which is associated with enormous health care expenditure as well as <b>indirect</b> <b>work</b> and disability-related costs. Despite extensive efforts to reduce LBP in nurses, evidence supporting the efficacy of any specific intervention to prevent LBP is limited. The majority of LBP prevention strategies are directed at occupational risk factors in working nurses. However, as there is some evidence that LBP is already a significant problem in nurses prior to commencing full time employment, it is proposed that nursing students should be the focus of prevention interventions. This would require prevention interventions targeting personal rather than occupational LBP risk factors. As the best personal predictor of future LBP is currently a previous history of LBP, further investigation of modifiable personal LBP risk factors is required. Consequently, the aim of this doctoral research was to identify modifiable personal characteristics that predict LBP in nursing students. Firstly, a large survey was conducted on undergraduate nursing students and recently graduated nurses to determine patterns of LBP prevalence. Results from this study indicated that LBP prevalence was very high at the commencement of undergraduate training. Prevalence of LBP did not significantly change during nursing training, but did increase further in the first year of commencing work as a nurse. This increase may be partly explained by the reported increase in occupational exposure to bending and lifting. Age was consistent across the undergraduate year groups and did not influence these findings. It was concluded that nursing students would provide a sufficient number of new-onset LBP episodes (and thus sufficient statistical power) for a prospective study design. Further, as these nursing students were not yet exposed to the occupational LBP risk factors of working nurses, a clearer indication of the influence of modifiable personal factors on the development of LBP could be determined by examining a student cohort. A cross-sectional study investigating the influence of personal physical, psychological and social/lifestyle factors was then conducted on nursing students. Preliminary analysis revealed clear gender differences across multiple domains. Therefore, the focus of further analysis was on the larger female sample. In Part 1 of the cross-sectional study, an investigation of regional differences in lumbar spine posture and movement was undertaken. Analysis of spinal kinematics in this study supported and extended previous literature that has found global lumbar spine kinematics do not accurately reflect the kinematics of the upper lumbar or lower lumbar spinal regions in common postures and movements. Rather, these two regions have a degree of functional independence. This finding has implications for interpretation of measures of spinal posture, motion and loading. Further, body mass index influenced regional lumbar posture and movement, possibly representing adaptation due to load. It was concluded that regional rather than global lumbar spine measures needed to be investigated in further analyses of this doctoral research. In Part 2 of the cross-sectional study, personal characteristics associated with LBP were investigated. Approximately one third of all subjects reported significant LBP in the 12 -months preceding the study. Analysis of factors associated with LBP supported the biopsychosocial nature of LBP. Higher stress levels and use of passive coping strategies, increased physical activity levels, holding the lower lumbar spine further from end-range flexion during functional tasks and increased age, all contributed independently to the presence of LBP. These findings supported the hypothesis that modifiable personal characteristics were associated with LBP. The importance of identifying sub-groups of LBP patients has become widely accepted. In Part 3, further exploratory analysis was conducted on this crosssectional data to determine if differences in physical and psychological characteristics were evident in two defined sub-groups of female nursing students with LBP. These sub-groups were based on O’Sullivan’s mechanism based classification system. Results indicated that two sub-groups of LBP subjects had differing physical and psychological characteristics associated with their LBP. Further, control subjects could be distinguished from each of these two sub-groups by different factors. These findings add validity to O’Sullivan’s LBP classification system. Further, the findings may suggest that different combinations of psychological and physical factors are linked to LBP in different sub-groups in this population, and therefore may require different intervention approaches based on these factors. In the final stage of this doctoral research, the cohort of female nursing students was followed prospectively for 12 -months. The focus of further analysis was on identifying modifiable personal predictors in a sub-group of subjects with new-onset LBP. The results of this study strongly supported that personal factors from multiple domains are predictors of new-onset LBP. After controlling for previous LBP, age and body weight, regression analysis identified that smoking, increased physical activity levels (both exercise and spinal loading), higher stress levels, reduced back muscle endurance, greater posterior pelvic tilt in slump sitting and more accurate spinal repositioning in sitting were all independent predictors of new-onset LBP. These findings have implications for the development of prevention and management interventions for LBP in nurses. Results from this doctoral investigation support the multi-factorial and biopsychosocial nature of LBP. The important distinction of this research when compared to previous work is the selection of a cohort at the beginning of their working life, with a focus on modifiable personal, rather than occupational factors, associated with LBP. Factors from physical, psychological and social/lifestyle domains were all independently associated with significant new-onset LBP in female nursing students. Interventions utilising a prevention approach that targets modifiable characteristics, such as those identified in this cohort of nursing students, may have the potential to reduce the impact of occupational LBP in this group. These preliminary findings have important implications for future LBP research and clinical interventions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{a model of}} meaningful work among a diverse sample of working adults. From the perspectives of Self-Determination Theory and the Psychology of Working Framework, we tested a structural model with social class and work volition predicting SDT motivation variables, which in turn predicted meaningful work. Partially supporting hypotheses, work volition {{was positively related to}} internal regulation and negatively related to amotivation, whereas social class was positively related to external regulation and amotivation. In turn, internal regulation was positively related to meaningful work, whereas external regulation and amotivation were negatively related to meaningful <b>work.</b> <b>Indirect</b> effects from <b>work</b> volition to meaningful work via internal regulation and amotivation were significant, and indirect effects from social class to meaningful work via external regulation and amotivaiton were significant. This study highlights the important relations between SDT motivation variables and meaningful work, especially the large positive relation between internal regulation and meaningful work. However, results also reveal that work volition and social class may play critical roles in predicting internal regulation, external regulation, and amotivation...|$|R

Study 1 compared errors in interpreting <b>indirect</b> messages in <b>work</b> and nonwork contexts across three cultures. Studies 2 and 3 examined differences in self-reported indirect-ness with coworkers versus nonwork acquaintances across three cultures controlling for variation in individualism–collectivism. Study 4 examined self-reported indirectness in bicultural managers and experimentally manipulated the salience of Western versus Eastern culture. The results showed that Americans, but not East Asians, were less attentive to <b>indirect</b> cues in <b>work</b> than nonwork settings and that East–West differences in indirectness were greater in work than nonwork settings.

While traditional hedonic modeling assumes the existence of direct links between environmental factors and property values, this paper suggests that such links are <b>indirect</b> and <b>work</b> through the investment decisions of homeowners, who choose to invest (or not to invest) in the maintenance and/or expansion of their properties. To verify this assumption, HCMs accumulated in four residential neighborhoods in Haifa, Israel are analyzed. The findings indicate a fairly strong association between environmental factors, building characteristics, rehabilitation activity and property values in these neighborhoods. The paper suggests an extra benefit for improving the environment, due to the dynamic process that may cause further investment. ...|$|R
