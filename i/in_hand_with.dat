5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{the increasing use of}} hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass bands had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{being a member of}} a band. This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass bands from the Rhondda both started as temperance bands. The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E

5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>With</b> an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks.

Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{inform the}} {{clinical}} management {{of patients with}} suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and case definition for CTS in epidemiological research, we explored the relation of symptoms and signs to sensory nerve conduction (SNC) measurements. METHODS: Patients aged 20 - 64 years who were referred to a neurophysiology service for investigation of suspected CTS, completed a symptom questionnaire (including hand diagrams) and physical examination (including Tinel's and Phalen's tests). Differences in SNC velocity between the little and index finger were compared according to the anatomical distribution of symptoms <b>in</b> the <b>hand</b> and findings on physical examination. RESULTS: Analysis was based on 1806 <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> 908 patients (response rate 73 %). <b>In</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> numbness or tingling but negative on both Tinel's and Phalen's tests, the mean difference in SNC velocities was no higher than <b>in</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> no numbness or tingling. The largest differences in SNC velocities occurred <b>in</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> extensive numbness or tingling in the median nerve sensory distribution and both Tinel's and Phalen's tests positive (mean 13. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 12. 6 - 15. 0 m/s). Hand pain and thumb weakness were unrelated to SNC velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that {{in the absence of}} other objective evidence of median nerve dysfunction, there is little value in referring patients of working age with suspected CTS for nerve conduction studies if they are negative on both Tinel's and Phalen's tests. Alternative case definitions for CTS in epidemiological research are proposed according to the extent of diagnostic information available and the relative importance of sensitivity and specificity...|$|R
