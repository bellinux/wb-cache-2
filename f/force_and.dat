40|$|Abstract: V-engines are {{subjected}} to noise and vibrations caused due to unbalanced inertial <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments, which makes its operation quite complicated. In order to minimize these vibrations, the unbalanced <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments are analyzed on a reciprocating engine for different V-angles. Firing order has a great influence on balancing of V-engine. This paper aims at making a major contribution for selecting the V-angle for six cylinders V-engine based on dynamic behavior of reciprocating engine. V-angle and firing order is decided by primary <b>and</b> secondary <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments. But theoretical analysis of primary <b>and</b> secondary <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments is very difficult, complex and time consuming. To overcome this difficulty, a Matlab program is developed. This program calculates the various unbalanced primary <b>and</b> secondary <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> couples for different V-angles in V 6 -engine along with different possible firing order so one can select proper combination of firing order and V-angle for optimum unbalance <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments...|$|R

40|$|In haptic-feedback teleoperation, the {{operator}} experiences <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> torques {{applied to the}} slave manipulator. These forces, however, consist of two components: on the one hand, <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> torques due to environmental contact, {{and on the other}} hand, non-contact forces, i. e., inertial forces, centrifugal <b>forces,</b> Coriolis <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> associated torques. For several reasons, eliminating these non-contact <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> torques from the force-torque measurements of the slave or scaling them may prove beneficial. For instance, in highly-dynamic teleoperation tasks, these <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> torques may contribute to operator fatigue or hamper the detection of environmental contacts. This paper briefly reviews how the inertial parameters of the slave load, e. g., an end-effector or a gripper, can be estimated. Subsequently, a method for eliminating the non-contact <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> torques from the measurements of a wrist-mounted forcetorque sensor or scaling them is presented. After a brief overview of our teleoperation system, experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
