In fact, her next submarine contact <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> until 17December and, like those before, resulted in no definite damage to the enemy. Although the opening months of 1918 brought no new U-boat contacts, Wadsworth worked hard escorting convoys and patrolling British waters.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E

Then a part of the Force Publique went to Egypt and British Mandatory Palestine and was redesignated the 1st Belgian Congo Brigade Group during 1943 and 1944.|$|E

The central vowels [...] <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> in open syllables and [...] <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> with final approximants [...] The vowels [...] seem {{to occur}} rarely {{with the final}} nasals [...] The {{incidence}} of final nasal consonants is very low, however, {{and it is not}} possible to conclusively state this as a restriction.

5|$|In 2012, Lieder {{claimed that}} U.S. President Barack Obama futilely {{attempted}} {{to announce the}} presence of Nibiru near the sun. After 2012, she claimed that several world leaders had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun on October 20, 2014. Two weeks after the supposed date of announcement, she claimed that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> because of consternation amongst the establishment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the central}} Atlantic, Hurricane Maria {{continued}} to strengthen in favorable conditions, and on September 5 briefly became a Category 3 hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) winds while 480miles (770km) east of Bermuda. Increasing shear and cooler waters caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a minimal hurricane on September 7. Operationally, the NHC believed that Maria had briefly weakened further into a tropical storm, but post-season analysis confirmed this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the AFC had {{undergone}} remarkable development, and its independence {{as a separate}} national force was unique among the Dominions. Deploying just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914, the first operational flight <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> until 27 May 1915 however, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq. The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b> Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E

The fluctuations <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E

5|$|Pickett then {{served as}} a {{division}} commander in the Defenses of Richmond. After P. G. T. Beauregard bottled up Benjamin Butler in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign, Pickett's division was detached in support of Robert E. Lee's operation in the Overland Campaign, just before the Battle of Cold Harbor, in which Pickett's division occupied {{the center of the}} defensive line, a place in which the main Union attack <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b> His division participated in the Siege of Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Politically, {{however, the}} battle is {{considered}} a failure for France. Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Salé to force repayment and avoid destruction of the city, but this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur.</b> The French demanded that those who killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves have their hands cut off; however, the governor of Salé simply banished these people from the city.|$|E

The current royal family, the House of Bernadotte, has reigned since 1818. The current monarch is Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity.|$|E

Despite the common misconception that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets, this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>occur</b> until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked the Miracle on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
