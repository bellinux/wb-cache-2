25|$|In New Zealand {{a filling}} station is often {{referred}} to as a service station, garage, or petrol station, even though the filling station may not offer mechanical repairs or assistance with dispensing fuel. Levels of service available include full service, for which assistance in dispensing fuel is offered, as well as offers to check tyre pressure or clean vehicle windscreens. This type of service is becoming uncommon in New Zealand, particularly Auckland. Further south of Auckland, many filling stations offer full service. There is also <b>help</b> <b>service</b> or assisted service, for which customers must request assistance before it is given, and self-service, for which no assistance is available.|$|E

2500|$|In 1842 John Gorrie {{created a}} system capable of {{refrigerating}} water to produce ice.

[...] During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade. [...] Carre’s refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans ice problems and by 1865 the city had three of Carre’s machines.

40|$|Social {{engagement}} {{has been}} associated with improved health outcomes in older people, although the precise mechanisms by which this is mediated are not clear. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between social engagement and health and social care use and medication use in older people. Data were derived from the 1985, 1989 and 1993 waves of the Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing, a nationally representative sample of people aged 65 and over. Logistic regression models were used to determine whether social engagement predicted cross-sectional and longitudinal health and social care use and medication use. People with higher social engagement were significantly less likely to have seen their family doctor, the district nurse or home <b>help</b> <b>services,</b> and to be taking two or more medications cross-sectionally. This relationship was independent of demographic factors, physical and mental health and physical activity for contact with the district nurse or home <b>help</b> <b>services.</b> Higher social engagement was associated with reduced contact with home <b>help</b> <b>services</b> after 4 years, independent of demographic factors, physical and mental health, and with reduced medication use after 4 years in unadjusted models. Higher social engagement was associated with increased contact with home <b>help</b> <b>services</b> after 8 years, when controlling for demographic factors, physical and mental health and physical activity. Higher social engagement may help to reduce cross-sectional health and social care service and medication use but further research is required to understand the benefits of social engagement and medium- and long-term service/medication use...|$|R

40|$|Homes are {{becoming}} increasingly connected as new technologies allow users to access media and information from any-device at anytime. Notebooks, HDTVs, smartphones, media servers, photo cameras, and video cameras, all form part of this new digital ecosystem where - the vision says - information and content will flow easily across devices, enabled by simple and intuitive user interfaces. These new home technologies are, however, often too complex for most users. Only "digital-natives" or technology savvy groups have the necessary skills, knowledge or confidence to adopt them and to use them effectively. For the rest, trying them becomes painful and frustrating. Moreover, the ecosystem itself adds confusion, given {{the large number of}} players involved and the many different kinds of relationships. Unless a dominant player gains enough power to establish a dominant digital home architecture, or this happens in some other way, most companies will continue to innovate around device-specific features that don't address the overall complexity of the complete systems that users have to work with. Digital <b>help</b> <b>services</b> can assist users by simplifying the selection, installation, learning and troubleshooting of new services and devices; facilitating the adoption of new convergent technologies. There is a broad range of potential services, including, for example, 'over the top' (OTT) television integration, smartphone mentoring services, WiFi network configuration and desktop support services. Communication service providers should pay close attention to digital <b>help</b> <b>services</b> as an opportunity to differentiate their offer, strengthen their relationship with end-customers, reduce customer support costs and simplify the adoption of bandwidth-intensive technologies. Moreover, digital <b>help</b> <b>services</b> can speed up the adoption of OTT television services, and companies can use them strategically. The technology help space is evolving and communication service providers need to figure out how they want to participate: offer <b>help</b> <b>services</b> themselves; partner or acquire a existing technology support company; and/or create an open marketplace for technology <b>help</b> <b>services.</b> by Juan Spiniak.

40|$|Despite the {{negative}} consequences associated with gambling, few problem gamblers seek professional help. This study aimed to examine awareness of professional sources of help and help-seeking behaviour amongst regular and problem gamblers. Australian gamblers (N = 730) were recruited from the general population, multicultural gambling venues, and gambling helplines and treatment services. Surveys measured awareness of professional <b>help</b> <b>services,</b> help-seeking behaviour and motivators and barriers to seeking help. Gamblers demonstrated low awareness of professional <b>help</b> <b>services.</b> Problem gamblers born in Australia or who were divorced {{were more likely to}} seek help. Problem gamblers who were reluctant to seek help due to a desire solve the problem on their own and feeling ashamed for themselves or their family pride {{were more likely to have}} overcome these barriers to seek help. However, significant barriers related to denial of problem severity and concerns about the ability to access low cost services that cater for multicultural populations predicted a lower likelihood of having sought help. Public education should aim to de-mystify the treatment process and educate gamblers about symptoms of problem gambling to reduce shame, stigma, and denial and encourage help-seeking. Ongoing education and promotion of <b>help</b> <b>services</b> is required to increase awareness of the resources available, including targeted promotions to increase awareness of relevant services among specific populations...|$|R
