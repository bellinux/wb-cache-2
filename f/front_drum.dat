5000|$|Rollers are {{available}} in different widths (from 10" [...] to 18") and diameters (from 4.5" [...] to 2.25" [...] for higher resistance). Some bicycle rollers use two <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> or cylinders instead of just one.|$|R
50|$|When {{performing}} live, Bile {{consists of}} Krztoff (vocals, lead guitar), R. H. Bear (bass, effects), Brendin Ross (keyboard), and former Agnostic <b>Front</b> <b>drummer</b> Steve Gallo. Bile mainly uses drum machines and sequencers for their live experience.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{featured}} {{independent front suspension}} using torsion {{bars and}} a live rear axle with leaf springs. A Girling hydro-mechanical braking system was fitted, with the <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> hydraulically operated while those at the rear used rod and cable.|$|R

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the model was that the {{handbrake}} operated on the <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|E
50|$|Coaster {{brakes and}} rim brakes were common. The 1968 Schwinn Krate models had a <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake. The 1972 Schwinn Pea Picker {{included}} a rear disc brake.|$|E
50|$|Brake drums were steel with a riveted {{cast iron}} liner. On some cars the drums were finned alloy {{again with a}} riveted cast iron liner. The final batch of cars used the 23-60 {{components}} and the <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> were very large, again with fins.|$|R
50|$|The chassis of the Lancaster was all new and {{featured}} {{independent front suspension}} using torsion {{bars and}} a live rear axle with leaf springs. A Girling hydro-mechanical braking system was fitted, with the <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> hydraulically operated while those at the rear used rod and cable. Wire wheels were an option but rarely fitted.|$|R

5000|$|The bike was a {{replacement}} for the earlier Honda CR450, made until 1981. [...] The '82 had a <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake and a four-speed gearbox;'83 had internally adjustable front forks and a five-speed gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} model, {{called the}} 'Fastback' {{was joined by}} the scrambler style 'S Type' which had a high level left-side exhaust and a 2.5-gallon (11 L) petrol tank. The first Commandos had a twin-leading-shoe <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake.|$|E
5000|$|The first A65S Spitfire of 1966 was confusingly {{designated}} Mark II and had {{a number}} of new features including two-way damped front forks, Girling shocks and a brace [...] between the downswept exhaust pipes. A 190mm <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake improved braking and lightweight alloy rims reduced the weight to 174 kg.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{examples}} {{continued to}} use the chain drive and independent suspension in the rear. 752 roadsters and 242 coupés were then produced. After that Honda switched to a conventional drive-shaft, live axle rear end with four radius rods and a Panhard rod. [...] 604 roadsters and 69 coupes were built with this setup before disc brakes replaced the <b>front</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... m/30 - This bicycle {{was very}} similar to the later issued m/42, except the pump was frame-mounted, the tools were stored in a frame-mounted leather bag, the carrier was the same sans the tool box, and {{although}} equipped with a <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake hub, there was no provision to use it. On the civilian model, the <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake was actuated by a brake cable connected to a brake handle. It differed noticeably from the German m/30, a spoon brake-equipped, balloon-tired roadster, though often mistaken for it. The Swedish m/30 was built according to specs established by an agreement with several large Swedish manufacturers regarding the interchangeability of parts, with most being assembled by Nymans (Hermes). Wheel size was 26 × 1½ inch (584 mm) and was equipped with a rear coaster-brake hub. Weight: ca. 23.5 kg (52 lb.) ...|$|E
50|$|For the 2003 {{model year}} the Blaster was updated with a re-styled front nose, and the {{headlight}} assembly was moved {{down from the}} handlebars to the nose, and an all around lighter machine for greater performance. The problematic mechanical rear and <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes were replaced by dual hydraulic disc brakes in both the front and rear.|$|E
5000|$|It {{also has}} five spoke-cast wheels with {{low-profile}} 120/90-10 front and 130/90-10 rear tires. The front fork has 2.6 in of travel, and rear shock has 2.4 in of travel. The scooter also has 155 mm hydraulic front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. (Models until 1998 had <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake {{instead of a}} hydraulic one.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Opel GT used a steel unibody and a {{conventional}} front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout. The engine was mounted {{far back in}} the chassis to improve weight distribution. Front suspension consisted of upper A-arms and a lower transverse leaf spring. A live axle and coil springs {{were used in the}} rear. The power-assisted braking system used discs in the <b>front,</b> <b>drums</b> in the rear. Steering was unassisted.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the Apollo included {{in no particular}} order, a 250 cubic-inch 1-barrel L-6, semi-closed cooling system, manual brakes with finned <b>front</b> <b>drums,</b> coil spring <b>front</b> suspension with stabilizer bar, extensive use on insulation and sound deadening materials, flow-through ventilation system, full-foam seats, front and rear ashtrays, strong, reinforced front bumpers, carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, roof drip moldings, and front and rear wheel opening moldings.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by a cam and lever {{system which}} {{provided}} a dual ratio to ease parking. Suspension was all elliptic (overslung in front, underslung at the rear) with rigid beam axles all controlled by Luvax-Girling double acting hydraulic shock absorbers—a transverse torsion bar linking both pairs. Brakes by Girling were mechanical using a wedge and roller system in 11 inch drums with twin leading {{shoes in the}} <b>front</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{featured}} air-cooled SOHC single-cylinder engines with {{chain drive}} and {{were designed to}} be easy to ride by beginners. Early GN250s featured a <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brake which was touchy in cold or wet weather. The drum was replaced by a disk after one year. Instrumentation included a speedometer, odometer with trip, high beam and turn indicator, and a gear position indicator.|$|E
50|$|The Dispatcher Jeep, or DJ, was a two-wheel-drive {{variant of}} the CJ series. Production started in 1955 by Willys which was renamed Kaiser Jeep in 1963. In 1970, American Motors (AMC) {{purchased}} Kaiser’s money-losing Jeep operations establishing AM General, a wholly owned subsidiary, that built this model through 1983. It was also the final light duty automobile to have <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} basic body, buyers of the Del Rio were offered a unique {{two-tone}} paint scheme (optional), better quality interior and exterior brightwork (including gold anodized aluminum accents) and a higher grade vinyl upholstery. Del Rio buyers also had their choice of either Ford’s “Mileage Maker” 144 hp six or its “Thunderbird” 312 hp V-8. The Del Rio was equipped with 11-inch <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes.|$|E

50|$|The Whitley {{only used}} the larger 2309 cc {{overhead}} valve engine with a tax rating of 18hp that had first appeared on export versions of the Tempest coupled {{with a choice of}} synchromesh or pre-selector gearbox. The front suspension was independent using torsion bars, while at the rear was a live axle and leaf springs. A Girling hydro-mechanical braking system was fitted, with the <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> hydraulically operated, while those at the rear were cable.|$|R

50|$|The brakes (disc <b>front,</b> <b>drum</b> rear) are servo-assisted dual-circuit {{style and}} the clutch is hydraulic. The turning circle is a {{relatively}} low 36.25'. Cargo space is 0.48 m³ (17 ft³), or 1.33 m³ (47 ft³) with the rear seats folded down. A spare tyre {{is located in the}} engine bay under the bonnet. The latter feature is considered a useful and practical feature by off-road fans.|$|E
50|$|Early {{models were}} prone to oil leaks and {{unstable}} idling. Both the carburetors {{and the design}} of the oil passages were redesigned beginning in 1977. Some models were offered as bare-bones transportation, with no electric start and <b>front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes. Most, however, had a single disc in the front and drum in the rear as well as electric and kick starters. Deluxe models also had a fairing and saddle bags.|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>drum</b> brakes may be {{of either}} design in practice, but the twin leading design is more effective. This design uses two {{actuating}} cylinders arranged so that both shoes use the self-applying characteristic when the vehicle is moving forwards. The brake shoes pivot at opposite points to each other. This gives the maximum possible braking when moving forwards, but is not so effective when the vehicle is traveling in reverse.|$|E
50|$|At {{launch the}} car shared the 948 cc A-Series straight-4 {{used in other}} Austins {{including}} its A35 predecessor. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs with a live axle and semi elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The drum brakes were a hybrid (hydromech) arrangement, hydraulically operated at the front but cable actuated at the rear.The <b>front</b> <b>drums</b> at 8 in were slightly larger than the 7 in rears. Cam and peg steering was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The 4th gear was {{modified}} {{compared to the}} box of the Dauphine Gordini. The original braking system was improved {{by the addition of}} cooling fins on the perimeter of the <b>front</b> <b>drums.</b> The suspension was that of the Dauphine type [...] "bad roads" [...] but with shorter springs without lowering the ground clearance. The 1093 was the only Dauphine to have been marketed in France with 12-volt electrical equipment similar to the export versions instead of the original 6 volts.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{only the}} 3K powered 2-door KE20 was {{available}} as a sedan and wagon / panelvan. The brakes were single system with no booster, solid discs on the <b>front</b> and rear <b>drums.</b> <b>Front</b> sway bar but no rear sway bar. Parts are not compatible with later models.|$|R
