50|$|Depending {{upon which}} Class {{certificate}} a pilot wants or needs, {{it is possible}} that either the <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Examiner</b> or the FAA may deny a pilot's medical certificate.

Pilots may appeal denials up to and including formal appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. The process of making an appeal includes meticulous documentation of a pilot's medical condition, therapies involved in treatment, and may be accompanied by psychological evaluations and/or other data. While any pilot may successfully make and receive approval via appeals, there are professional organizations that exist to aid pilots in appealing the denial of a medical certificate.|$|R
