Honestly, it seems like a challenging gamble since most EU Countries have an almost non-existent CH 4 -fuelled fleet. Alternatively, Italy already has both a sizeable fleet and a good knowledge of how to use methane for automotive purposes. Consequently, it would be easier in the Italian context to attain this proposal. At present, the Italian natural gas refueling network is growing at a fairly fast rate. There are already plans to build new stations, especially in the less-served geographical areas. This phase began in the 90 ’s when environmental issues were extensively felt and influenced by public opinion. 1. 2 Issue’s importance The advantages deriving from expanding the NG-fuelled car share are manifold. First of all, it will help to lower both the global and the local emissions. Since car fleet mileage ha...|$|R
