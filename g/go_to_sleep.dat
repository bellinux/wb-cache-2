5|$|The second {{match was}} the finals of the Intercontinental Championship {{contender}} tournament between Rey Mysterio and CM Punk. In the end, Mysterio attempted the 619 but Punk countered the {{move into the}} <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between CM Punk and Elijah Burke. Throughout the match, the two {{exchanged}} many aerial maneuvers. Punk won the match by pinning Burke after performing a GTS (<b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} the ECW Championship Triple Threat match, in which CM Punk defended the title against John Morrison and The Miz. Throughout the match, The Miz and Morrison double-teamed Punk, however, Miz turned on Morrison by attacking him. After Miz threw Morrison out of the ring, Punk performed a <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> to retain the Title.|$|E
50|$|By this time, {{the crew}} had {{completely}} abandoned the planned <b>sleep</b> shifts. Lovell <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> 32½ hours into the flight—3½ hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> after taking a sleeping pill.|$|R
60|$|For {{a time he}} sat drowsily {{enjoying the}} rest and warmth, and then, lying down on a layer of spruce-twigs, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> But the cold wakened him. One of the packers got up, grumbling, and threw more {{branches}} on the fire, and Gerald <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again.|$|R
60|$|And he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again; while, disdaining reply, Augusta worked on.|$|R
5|$|Not {{wanting a}} tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and {{attacked}} Laurinaitis. As Cena {{returned to the}} ring, Punk performed a <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Sleep</b> on Cena and pinned him to win the WWE Championship. McMahon ordered {{the winner of the}} Raw Money in the Bank match, Alberto Del Rio, to cash in his contract on Punk. When Del Rio ran out and tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a roundhouse kick on Del Rio before he could do so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.|$|E
5|$|When Lee and Jude {{leave for}} the weekend {{to stay with her}} parents so that Tim can work without {{distraction}} on the family's taxes, he invites a group of friends—including Ray (Sam Rockwell), Phil (Mike Birbiglia), Adam (Kent Osborne), and Paul (Steve Berg)—to the house for the night. After a few drinks, they decide to dig up the backyard together, quickly finding another bone and a license plate. Phil, who is skeptical about the digging, leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia (Anna Kendrick), Max (Brie Larson) and Billy (Chris Messina) arrive at the house. Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig. He finds a shoe before deciding to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes {{frustrated}} when Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{refers to}} Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) as his boss. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E

60|$|Corny woke {{up every}} now and then, but she soon <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again, when she found there was no boat or sail in sight. At least, I thought she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> but {{she might have been}} {{thinking}} and crying. She was so crouched up that we could not see whether she was awake or not.|$|R
60|$|And {{then they}} dropped their heads on their paws and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
5|$|On April 10, Punk briefly {{became a}} villain by joining the New Breed alliance, after several weeks {{in which both}} the New Breed and the ECW Originals had {{attempted}} to recruit him. Two weeks later, however, Punk betrayed the New Breed during a four-on-four elimination match between the New Breed and ECW Originals by kicking New Breed leader Elijah Burke {{in the back of}} the head and costing them the match. After the match, Punk proceeded to deliver his finisher, the <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep,</b> on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, becoming a fan favorite again. At Judgment Day, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a pay-per-view. Punk then went on to One Night Stand and teamed up with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in a tables match to defeat the New Breed.|$|E
5|$|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two {{teenagers}} {{from the city}} of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by stage fright and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.|$|E
5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> as they have to get up early the next morning.|$|E
60|$|After his meagre meal {{he wrapped}} {{himself in his}} blanket, and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|And he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in two seconds. I {{shook him}} by the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|ELLIE. No. Only {{the last}} thing the captain said before he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Sleep</b> maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena {{to fall out of}} the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to ring the bell. This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E
5|$|Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy) {{goes to the}} Springwood Diner to {{meet with}} her ex-boyfriend, Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), who falls asleep {{at the table and}} meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend, {{waitress}} Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for fear that she will die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
5|$|When ECW Champion Bobby Lashley {{was drafted}} to Raw and {{stripped}} of the ECW Championship, a tournament {{to declare a}} new champion was held. Punk was scheduled to face Chris Benoit in the finals at , but Benoit was hastily replaced by Johnny Nitro when Benoit no-showed, after killing his family and self. Nitro subsequently defeated Punk for the vacant ECW Championship. Punk won another shot at the title at The Great American Bash against Nitro, who had changed his moniker to John Morrison by this point; however, Punk was defeated again by Morrison. The next week, Punk challenged Elijah Burke and Tommy Dreamer in a triple threat match to determine the next competitor in Morrison's 15 Minutes of Fame Challenge, in which Punk came out victorious. A week later, Punk defeated Morrison with the <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> to earn an ECW Championship title match at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, however, Punk lost the match when Morrison used the ropes for leverage.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a {{match for}} his title at Night of Champions. Due to {{interference}} from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, {{he was able to}} defeat Batista. The next night on Raw, which happened a week after that year's draft lottery, Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property (Triple H, who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge was still out of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
